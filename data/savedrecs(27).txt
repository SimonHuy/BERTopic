Food Chemistry					This study aims to investigate the effect of pH levels (pH 7.0 and pH 8.1) on binding ability of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) with lycopene (LYC) and elucidate interaction mechanisms using multi-spectroscopy and molecular docking study. beta-LG at pH 8.1 showed a stronger binding affinity to lycopene than that at pH 7.0 according to binding constant, binding number, energy transfer efficiency, and surface hydrophobicity. Lycopene bound to protein mainly by van der Waals force in the form of static quenching mode and preferred to interact with beta-LG at the top of barrel for both pH levels. Molecular dynamic simulation revealed that beta-LG/LYC complex at pH 8.1 was more stable than at pH 7.0. beta-LG/LYC complexes formed at pH 8.1 showed significantly higher ABTS radical scavenging activity than samples at pH 7.0 (p < 0.05). Data obtained may contribute valuable information for preparing a whey protein-based delivery system for lycopene.

J		Cebi, N.; Arici, M.; Sagdic, O.							The famous Turkish rose essential oil: characterization and authenticity monitoring by FTIR, Raman and GC-MS techniques combined with chemometrics.		Food Chemistry					There is a necessity for rapid, robust, easy, accurate and cost-effective methodologies for the quality control of essential oils from medicinal and aromatic plants. Rosa damascena essential oil is a high-value natural product with its unique quality properties and economic importance. This research evaluated the capability of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) techniques combined with chemometrics for determination of the authenticity of R. damascena essential oil. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were successfully employed with 100% accuracy for discrimination of authentic R. damascena essential oil samples from fraudulent commercial samples. Consistent results were obtained by FTIR, Raman and GC-MS techniques. Two of twenty commercial samples were determined as authentic R. damascena essential oil samples using the three analytical techniques. Findings showed that FTIR and Raman spectroscopy combined with chemometrics could be used as reliable, robust, rapid, accurate and low-cost analytical techniques for quality evaluation of R. damascena essential oil.

J		Cebi, N.; Taylan, O.; Abusurrah, M.; Sagdic, O.							Detection of orange essential oil, isopropyl myristate, and benzyl alcohol in lemon essential oil by FTIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics.		Foods					Essential oils are high-valued natural extracts that are involved in industries such as food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutics. The lemon essential oil (LEO) has high economic importance in the food and beverage industry because of its health-beneficial characteristics and desired flavor properties. LEO, similar to other natural extracts, is prone to being adulterated through economic motivations. Adulteration causes unfair competition between vendors, disruptions in national economies, and crucial risks for consumers worldwide. There is a need for cost-effective, rapid, reliable, robust, and eco-friendly analytical techniques to detect adulterants in essential oils. The current research developed chemometric models for the quantification of three adulterants (orange essential oil, benzyl alcohol, and isopropyl myristate) in cold-pressed LEOs by using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), principal component regression (PCR), and partial least squares regression (PLSR) based on FTIR spectra. The cold-pressed LEO was successfully distinguished from adulterants by robust HCA. PLSR and PCR showed high accuracy with high R2 values (0.99-1) and low standard error of cross-validation (SECV) values (0.58 and 5.21) for cross-validation results of the raw, first derivative, and second derivative FTIR spectra. The findings showed that FTIR spectroscopy combined with multivariate analyses has a considerable capability to detect and quantify adulterants in lemon essential oil. © 2020 by the authors.

J		Cebi, N.							Quantification of the geranium essential oil, palmarosa essential oil and phenylethyl alcohol in Rosa damascena essential oil using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics.		Foods					Rosa damascena essential oil is an essential oil that has the greatest industrial importance due to its unique quality properties. The study used ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared) spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics of PLSR (partial least squares regression) and PCR (principal component regression) for quantification of probable adulterants of geranium essential oil (GEO), palmarosa essential oil (PEO) and phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEOH). Hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to observe the classification pattern of Rosa damascena essential oil, spiked samples and adulterants. Rosa damascena essential oil was spiked with each adulterant at concentrations of 0-100% (v/ v). Excellent R2 (regression coefficient) values (≥0.96) were obtained in all PLSR and PCR cross-validation models. The SECV (standard error of cross-validation) values ranged between 0.43 and 4.15. The lowest SECV and bias values were observed in the PLSR and PCR models, which were built by using the raw FTIR spectra of all samples. Hierarchical cluster analysis through Ward's algorithm and Euclidian distance had high potential to observe the classification pattern of all adulterated and authentic samples. In conclusion, the combination of ATR-FTIR spectroscopy with multivariate analysis can be used for rapid, cost-effective, easy, reliable and high-throughput detection of GEO, PEO and PEOH in Rosa damascena essential oil. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cebrian, E.; Nunez, F.; Rodriguez, M.; Grassi, S.; Gonzalez-Mohino, A.							Potential of near infrared spectroscopy as a rapid method to discriminate OTA and non-OTA-producing mould species in a dry-cured ham model system.		Toxins					The ripening process of dry-cured meat products is characterised by the development of fungi on the product's surface. This population plays a beneficial role, but, uncontrolled moulds represent a health risk, since some of them may produce mycotoxins, such as ochratoxin A (OTA). The aim of the present work is to assess the potential of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the detection of OTA-producing mould species on dry-cured ham-based agar. The collected spectra were used to develop Support Vector Machines-Discriminant Analysis (SVM-DA) models by a hierarchical approach. Firstly, an SVM-DA model was tested to discriminate OTA and non-OTA producers; then, two models were tested to discriminate species among the OTA producers and the non-OTA producers. OTA and non-OTA-producing moulds were discriminated with 85% sensitivity and 86% specificity in the prediction. Furthermore, the SVM-DA model could differentiate non-OTA-producing species with a 95% sensitivity and specificity. Promising results were obtained for the prediction of the four OTA-producing species tested, with a 69% and 90% sensitivity and specificity, respectively. The preliminary approach demonstrated the high potential of NIR spectroscopy, coupled with Chemometrics, to be used as a real-time automated routine monitorization of dry-cured ham surfaces. © 2021 by the authors.

Analysis of intact glycosidic aroma precursors in grapes by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector.		Foods					Nowadays, the techniques for the analysis of glycosidic precursors in grapes involve changes in the glycoside structure or it is necessary the use of very expensive analytical techniques. In this study, we describe for the first time an approach to analyse intact glycosidic aroma precursors in grapes by high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD), a simple and cheap analytical technique that could be used in wineries. Briefly, the skin of Muscat of Alexandria grapes was extracted using a microwave and purified using solid-phase extraction combining Oasis MCX and LiChrolut EN cartridges. In total, 20 compounds were selected by HPLC-DAD at 195 nm and taking as a reference the spectrum of phenyl beta-D-glucopyranoside, whose DAD spectrum showed a first shoulder from 190 to 230 nm and a second around 200-360 nm. After that, these glycosidic compounds were identified by High-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-qTOF-MS). Disaccharides hexose pentose were the most abundant group observed with respect to the sugars and monoterpendiols the main aglycones found. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cebrian-Tarancon, C.; Fernandez-Roldan, F.; Sanchez-Gomez, R.; Salinas, R.; Llorens, S.							Vine-shoots as enological additives. A study of acute toxicity and cytotoxicity.		Foods					Toasted vine-shoots have been recently proposed as enological additives that can be used to improve the sensorial profile of wines. However, the possible toxicity of this new winery practice has not been studied so far. The aim of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of Tempranillo, Cencibel, and Cabernet Sauvignon toasted vine-shoots when used in winemaking. First, vine-shoots were characterized in terms of minerals and phenolic and furan compounds, and then their acute toxicity and cytotoxicity were studied using Microtox and the metabolic reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. High EC50 values were obtained when the Microtox assay was applied to vine-shoot aqueous extracts, similar to the case of herbal infusions. When the MTT assay was used, a cell viability above 70% was observed in all the wines made with those vine-shoots, and an even greater viability was observed in the case of Cabernet Sauvignon. Therefore, it was concluded that those vine-shoots have no cytotoxic potential. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Flavan-3-ol microbial metabolites modulate proteolysis in neuronal cells reducing amyloid-beta (1-42) levels.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Introduction. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegeneration characterized by extensive protein aggregation and deposition in the brain, associated with defective proteasomal and autophagic-lysosomal proteolytic pathways. Since current drugs can only reduce specific symptoms, the identification of novel treatments is a major concern in AD research. Among natural compounds, (poly) phenols and their derivatives/metabolites are emerging as candidates in AD prevention due to their multiple beneficial effects. This study aims to investigate the ability of a selection of phenyl-gamma-valerolactones, gut microbiota-derived metabolites of flavan-3-ols, to modulate the functionality of cellular proteolytic pathways. Methods and Results. Neuronal SH-SY5Y cells transfected with either the wild-type or the 717 valine-to-glycine amyloid precursor protein mutated gene are used as an AD model and treated with 5-(4′-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone, 5-(3′, 4′-dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone and 5-(3′-hydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone-4′-sulfate. Combining in vitro and in silico studies, it is observed that the phenyl-gamma-valerolactones of interest modulated cellular proteolysis via proteasome inhibition and consequent autophagy upregulation and inhibited cathepsin B activity, eventually reducing the amount of intra-and extracellular amyloid-beta (1-42) peptides. Conclusion. The findings of this study establish, for the first time, that these metabolites exert a neuroprotective activity by regulating intracellular proteolysis and confirm the role of autophagy and cathepsin B as possible targets of AD preventive/therapeutic strategies. © 2021 The Authors.

Comparative phytochemical profile of the elephant garlic (Allium ampeloprasum var. holmense) and the common garlic (Allium sativum) from the Val di Chiana area (Tuscany, Italy) before and after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.		Food Chemistry					This study is aimed to comparatively investigate the phytochemical profiles, focusing on the nutritional and phytochemical properties of common garlic (Allium sativum L.; CG) and elephant garlic (EG) (Allium ampeloprasum var. holmense) collected from the Val di Chiana area (Tuscany, Italy). The results showed a lower amount of fibers, demonstrating a higher digestibility of the bulb, and sulfur-containing compounds in EG rather than in CG. Untargeted metabolomic profiling followed by supervised and unsupervised statistics allowed understanding the differences in phytochemical composition among the two bulbs, both as raw bulbs, processed following the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion process. Typical sulfur-containing compounds, such as alliin and N-gamma-glutamyl-S-allyl cysteine, could notably be detected in lower amounts in EG. EG maintains a distinct phytochemical signature during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Our findings support the distinct sensorial attributes of the bulbs. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ceccanti, C.; Pellegrini, E.; Guidi, L.							Effect of superheated steam and conventional steam roasting on nutraceutical quality of several vegetables.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The superheated steam technology (SHST) is a heat treatment that involves a heated saturated steam. To date, the use as cooking technology has not been evaluated in depth in terms of retention of phytochemicals. In this study, the use of SHST was compared with a conventional saturated steam (CS) oven in order to evaluate their impact on different vegetables (tomato fruits, spinach leaves and artichoke inflorescences). At biochemical level, phenolic compounds, total ascorbic acid content, some specific antioxidant compounds and, consequently, the antioxidant activity have been evaluated. Results reported a decrease of bioactivity in the tomato cooked samples (in both the heat treatments) when compared with the fresh sample. Instead, spinach leaves and artichoke inflorescences reported an increase of phytochemicals and antioxidant activity in CS or SHS samples when compared with fresh ones. Few differences in the content of bioactive compounds were observed after the use of the CS or SHS technology. Further analyses are required to verify the differences between the use of superheated or conventional steam on vegetables. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Differences in the phenolic composition and nutraceutical properties of freeze dried and oven-dried wild and domesticated samples of Sanguisorba minor Scop.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Recent studies have dealt about the phenolic compounds and the nutraceutical properties of Sanguisorba minor Scop and about the possibility of their domestication to standardise the plant production. However, it is also known that the storage conditions can affect the bioactive compounds present in plants. Thus, wild (W) and domesticated (F1, F2, F3) S. minor samples were exposed to different drying methods (oven-drying at 60 °C until constant weight named OD or freeze-drying until constant weight named FD) and studied for their content in phenolic compounds, antioxidant, antimicrobial, cytotoxic and anti-inflammatory properties. In general, OD samples showed the highest nutraceutical properties and the highest content in phenolic compounds. The most abundant phenolic compounds in both drying methods were kaempferol-3-O-glucoside and caffeoyl ester, with some differences between wild and domesticated samples. Wild samples showed higher antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity than domesticated ones, except for the OD F3 and FD F2 samples that reported cytotoxicity against HeLa cells. This study provides important information to choose the most adequate methodology to retain phenolic compounds and nutraceutical properties of S. minor species. Further researches are necessary to standardise the domestication of the studied wild species and verify the highest efficiency of the OD method. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Volatile profile of two-phase olive pomace (Alperujo) by HS-SPME-GC-MS as a key to defining volatile markers of sensory defects caused by biological phenomena in virgin olive oil.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					An olive pomace from the two-phase decanter stored in different conditions was used as a model to simulate the detrimental biological phenomena occurring during olive oil processing and storage. A group of EVOO and defective oils were also analyzed. The volatile fraction was studied with HS-SPME-GC-MS; 127 volatiles were identified (55 of which tentatively identified) and evaluated over time. Seven volatiles were tentatively identified for the first time in olive oil; the role of C6 alcohols in detrimental biological phenomena was highlighted. Suitable volatile markers for defects of microbiological origin were defined, particularly the fusty/muddy sediment. They were then applied to olive oils with different quality categories; one of the markers was able to discriminate among EVOOs and all the defective samples, including the borderline ones. The marker was constituted by the sum of concentrations of 10 esters, 4 alcohols, 1 ketone, and 1 alpha-hydroxy-ketone but no carboxylic acids.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Durum wheat semolina is the best raw material for pasta production and its protein content and gluten strength are essential for cooking quality. The need to develop rapid methods to speed up quality control makes near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) a useful method that is widely accepted in the cereal sector. In this study, two non-destructive and rapid technologies, a low-cost sensor providing a short wavelength NIR range (swNIR: 700-1100nm) and a handheld NIR spectrometer (NIR: 1600-2400nm), were employed to evaluate semolina quality. The spectra data were correlated with chemical (protein content) and rheological parameters (i.e., Gluten Index, Alveograph, Sedimentation test, GlutoPeak). A partial least squares (PLS) model was used to compare the efficacy of swNIR and NIR. Results. The protein content was the reference parameter that correlated best with the spectra data and provided the best regression model (r model=0.9788 for NIR and 0.9561 for swNIR). GlutoPeak indices also correlated well with spectral data, particularly with swNIR spectra. A provisional multivariate model was applied to classify semolina samples in quality classes by using their spectra. Better modeling efficiency was obtained for swNIR. Conclusion. The results highlighted the advantages of a pocket-sized low cost sensor (swNIR), which is easier to use directly at the sample source than laboratory instruments or more expensive portable devices. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

The untargeted lipidomic profile of quarter milk from dairy cows with subclinical intramammary infection by non-aureus staphylococci.		Journal of Dairy Science					This observational study determined the lipidome of cow milk during subclinical intramammary infection (IMI) by non-aureus staphylococci (NAS), also defined as coagulase-negative staphylococci, using an untargeted approach. Among the pathogens causing bovine IMI, NAS have become the most frequently isolated bacteria from milk samples. Although the application of system biology approaches to mastitis has provided pivotal information by investigating the transcriptome, proteome, peptidome, and metabolome, the milk lipidome during mammary gland inflammation remains undisclosed. To cover this gap, we determined the milk lipidome of 17 dairy cows with IMI caused by NAS (NAS-IMI), and we compared the results with those of healthy quarter milk from 11 cows. The lipidome was determined following a liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry approach. Sixteen subclasses of lipids were identified in both groups of animals. From 2,556 measured lipids, the abundance of 597 changed more than 10-fold in quarter milk with NAS-IMI compared with healthy quarters. The results demonstrate the influence of NAS-IMI on the milk lipidome, implying significant changes in lipid species belonging to the family of triacylglycerols and sphingomyelins, and contribute to the understanding of inflammatory processes in the bovine udder, highlighting potential novel biomarkers for improving mastitis diagnostics.

Foods					Enrichment with phenolic compounds is proposed as a strategy to obtain more stable and healthier candy products. A green propolis ethanolic dry extract (PEE) from Braccharis dracunculifolia (Brazilian Alecrim-do Campo) was assessed as an antioxidant in jelly candies. Three levels (0, 0.01, and 0.02% w/w) of PEE were tested in jelly candies alternatively made with two carbohydrate bases (sugars or fructans) and three fruity dyes and flavours (menthe, orange, or strawberry). Propolis polyphenol content (identified by HPLC-MS and quantified by HPLC-DAD/UV-Vis), antioxidant capacity (total phenolics and radical scavenging activity), physical properties (moisture, pH, CIELab colour, and texture profile analysis), and flavour were studied in candies. PEE was rich in polyphenols (>8.7%), including several prenylated p-coumaric, caffeoylquinic and diterpenic acids, and flavonoids, with Artepillin-C (3.4%) as the main bioactive compound. The incorporation of PEE into the hot liquor at 80°C for 5 min before moulding allowed a good retention of propolis polyphenols in the final product (recovery percentages of up to 97.4% for Artepillin-C). Jelly candies made with sugars or dietetic fructans have poor antioxidant properties, which depend on the dyes and flavours used. Using PEE (at 0.02%) strongly improved the antioxidant capacity (relative increases of up to 465%) of candies without altering the pH, colour, or texture, although off-flavour may appear. Propolis, due to its good antioxidant properties, has potential for use as a functional ingredient in jelly candies. © 2021 by the authors.

Antioxidant activity of two edible isothiocyanates: sulforaphane and erucin is due to their thermal decomposition to sulfenic acids and methylsulfinyl radicals.		Food Chemistry					Sulforaphane (SFN) and erucin (ERN) are isothiocyanates (ITCs) bearing, respectively, methylsulfinyl and methylsulfanyl groups. Their chemopreventive and anticancer activity is attributed to ability to modulate cellular redox status due to induction of Phase 2 cytoprotective enzymes (indirect antioxidant action) but many attempts to connect the bioactivity of ITCs with their radical trapping activity failed. Both ITCs are evolved from their glucosinolates during food processing of Cruciferous vegetables, therefore, we studied antioxidant behaviour of SFN/ERN at elevated temperature in two lipid systems. Neither ERN nor SFN inhibit the oxidation of bulk linolenic acid (below 100 °C) but both ITCs increase oxidative stability of soy lecithin (above 150 °C). On the basis of GC-MS analysis we verified our preliminary hypothesis (Antioxidants 2020, 9, 1090) about participation of sulfenic acids and methylsulfinyl radicals as radical trapping agents responsible for the antioxidant effect of edible ITCs during thermal oxidation of lipids at elevated temperatures (above 140 °C).

J		Cei, L.; Stefani, G.; Defrancesco, E.							How do local factors shape the regional adoption of geographical indications in Europe? Evidences from France, Italy and Spain.		Food Policy					The spread of geographical indications (GIs) is quite heterogeneous within the European Union. Some areas show a large number of registered GI products, while others scarcely use this policy tool. In our study, we investigate the relation between several environmental and socio-economic factors and the degree of GI use at regional level in the three leading countries in terms of registered GI products: Italy, France and Spain. To do so, we implement an infrequency of purchase model that allows us to estimate two sets of parameters. In this way we can estimate the effect of each factor on two measures: the probability of observing a new GI registration in a region and the variation of the intensity of protection. Our findings show that marginality conditions, such as the presence of less favored areas or the remoteness of an area, the producers' attitude to cooperate and the past tradition of registering GI products are the major determinants of the degree of protection sought through GI labels. This allows interesting conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the GI policy in targeting less developed areas, as well as suggesting possible ways to further stimulate the use of GIs for protecting local products.

Assessment of sensory and texture profiles of grape seeds at real maturity stages using image analysis.		Foods					The usefulness of digital image analysis in estimating sensory attributes of grape seeds in relation to maturation level was evaluated for the first time. Seeds from Syrah grapes harvested throughout the ripening period were grouped according to maturity using the DigiEye system. The discriminant ability, homogeneity, repeatability, and uniformity of a sensory panel were assessed after training on grape seeds. The aim was to evaluate the use of digital image techniques in order to accurately establish the maturity level of grape seeds, based on sensory and textural features. All sensory attributes (color, hardness, cracking, vegetal, bitterness and astringency) showed significant (p< 0.05) correlations with the chemical maturity stage. Color and vegetal (sensory attributes), together with deformation energy (instrumental texture parameter) (De), allowed for the classification of the seeds into four real maturity stages, hence their usefulness as grape seed ripening indicators. Significant (p< 0.05) and high-correlation factors were also found between instrumental and sensory attributes. Therefore, digital analysis can be a useful tool to better define the maturity stage in the vineyard, and to dispose of grape seeds with well-defined sensory profiles for specific oenological applications. This could help to determine the optimal harvest date to manage winemaking, in order to produce high quality wines in warm climates. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Celebi, M.; Simsek, B.							Scalding process optimization to enhance the textural properties of Kashar cheese.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of the study is to optimize the scalding process through scalding water temperature, acidity, and salt concentration effective on the quality of Kashar cheese using response surface methodology. The textural and meltability properties of Kashar cheese have been used at the evaluation of optimization. The textural, meltability, and sensory assessment points of ripened Kashar cheese sold in the market have been utilized as target values in the optimization. Optimum scalding conditions were found as; 80.80 °C of temperature, 1.45 °SH of water acidity, and 10.00% of salt concentration providing 89.30 N,-309.35 g sn, 0.75,66.18 N, and 21.47 mm values for hardness, adhesiveness, cohesiveness, gumminess, and meltability. According to the verification production, it was determined that the existing models gave successful results in estimating the texture and meltability values (95% in confidence interval). Practical applications. The purpose of the present study was to optimize the scalding process (temperature, acidity, and salt concentration of scalding water) effective on the quality of Kashar cheese. It further aims to study the effect of these scalding parameters on the textural properties and meltability of the Kashar cheese. The production of Kashar cheese with optimum scalding water parameters provided the expected textural properties and meltability values in Kashar cheese. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			simsek, bedia/0000-0002-7497-1542; CELEBI, MEHMET/0000-0002-0769-299X							2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15535					FSTA:2021-10-Pj5407
J		Celebioglu, A.; Uyar, T.							Electrohydrodynamic encapsulation of eugenol-cyclodextrin complexes in pullulan nanofibers.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this report, the inclusion complexes of eugenol-gamma cyclodextrin (gammaCD) were incorporated in pullulan nanofibers using electrospinning technique. As a control sample, the pristine eugenol contained pullulan nanofibers were electrospun, as well. The nanofibrous webs were prepared with the initial eugenol content of 12% (w/w) and pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD nanofibers could preserve ~93% of this volatile essential oil compound due to inclusion complexation. On the other hand, only ~23% of eugenol was preserved in case of pullulan/eugenol nanofibers. The inclusion complexation also provided an enhanced thermal stability for eugenol and its volatilization shifted from ~50-190 °C to ~125-300 °C in case of pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD nanofibers. The antioxidant performance of eugenol was not affected by the inclusion complexation and the nanofibers of pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD and pullulan/eugenol indicated ~100% and ~58% radical scavenging activity for the same nanofiber concentration (250 mum/mL). Moreover, pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD nanofibers maintained the antioxidant activity even after 3-months storage at room temperature (~98%) and heat-treatment performed at 175 °C for 1 h (~93%). The time dependent release test indicated that pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD nanofibers has a release profile in a relatively controlled manner compared to pullulan/eugenol nanofibers under the same experimental conditions. Here, the functional nanofibrous web encapsulated an essential oil compound was developed using the edible pullulan and non-toxic and natural cyclodextrin molecules. Therefore, pullulan/eugenol-gammaCD nanofibers can be quite a promising encapsulation and carrying matrix for the essential oils which are widely used in both food and pharmaceutical areas.

Food Bioscience					Honey is a health promoter that is used to treat in various diseases. Probiotics are live microorganisms that exert health benefits on the host, when administered in adequate amounts. With other diet constituents, probiotic bacteria can alter the composition of microbiota and exert more health benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effects of lime honey on well-known probiotic bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5 and Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, and in vitro cytotoxic effects of the combination on breast and colon cancer cells MCF-7 and Caco-2, respectively. The results showed that lime honey enhanced the probiotic properties of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus rhamnosus, including auto-aggregation and surface hydrophobicity. Furthermore, the addition of lime honey to the growth of lactobacilli enhanced cytotoxicity in breast and colon cancer cells, while it did not significantly affect healthy cells. In conclusion, honey may have not only direct effects on human health, but also indirect benefits mediated by beneficial microorganisms. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effects of bruising of "Pink Lady" apple under impact loading in drop test on firmness, colour and gas exchange of fruit during long term storage.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The bruising phenomenon of apple fruit under impact loading is still a very important problem to be solved in order to design optimal harvest and processing systems and for ensuring the quality of the fruit during long-term periods of storage. This study focused on deformation simulation of apples (cv. "Pink Lady") under dynamic impact loading during drop tests in order to describe time-dependent bruising occurrence and the bruising effect on the postharvest fruit quality during long-term storage. In the study, analytical, experimental methods and finite element analysis based explicit dynamics simulation techniques were employed. Three drop heights (250 mm, 500 mm and 750 mm) and three impact materials (structural steel, high-density polyethylene and wood) and single fruit orientation (transverse) for the drop tests were considered. Experimental drop test, physical and chromatographic analyses at the time of harvest (first testing day) and during storage periods of 30, 120 and 210 days were realised. Physical and chromatographic analyses revealed that damaged apples lost a greater amount of weight when considering the increase in drop height. Furthermore, bruised surfaces of apples lost their luminosity just after the drop test. Ethylene production and respiration rates rapidly increased just after the fruit bruising and this increase was correlated with the drop height. Additionally, material tests revealed the yield stress point of the apple as 0.385 MPa and the simulation results provided useful visuals and numerical data related to the time-dependent bruising phenomenon. The validation study on the experimental and simulation setup revealed that bruising surface area is a more accurate measurement than bruise volume when evaluating bruising on the fruit flesh through a numerical method-based simulation study (average relative difference: 5.5%).

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Potential lactobacilli isolates (20) from traditional yogurt samples were primarily selected based on their antimicrobial activity against common pathogens of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Following this, the highest acidity values were determined in K1 (0.63%) and EPSC2 (0.61%) isolates after 6 h; KKC1 (1.62%) and EPSC2 (1.59%) after 24 h. The highest proteolytic activity in the first 36 h of incubation was observed in K11B, M2, CBB5 and CBB3 isolates while the lowest activity was in K10, M6, and KKC2 isolates, respectively. Subsequently, 10 isolates that carry the potential to be used as yogurt starter cultures were picked and identified at the molecular level using 16S rDNA sequences and a phylogenetic tree was created. The closest species to all of the selected isolates was determined to be Lactobacillus bulgaricus. The flavor profiles of these isolates indicated that the highest acetaldehyde concentrations were detected in the KKC1, M6, and KKC2 isolates while these values were found to be higher than that of the commercial Lactobacillus. Consequently, CBX, CBH4, M6, EPSC2, and KKC2 were found to possess the potential to be used as starter cultures therefore they could be recommended for utilization in fermented dairy products, especially yogurt.

J		Celik, S. Y.							Identification of protease enzyme in salep orchid tubers, and investigation of the usability of the enzyme in casein and gluten hydrolysis.		International Food Research Journal					In recent years, due to many diseases transmitted from animals to humans (coronavirus disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome, mad cow, and bird and swine flu), consumers are concerned about the use of protease enzymes derived from animal sources in the production of food products. These concerns have increased the demand for protease enzymes of plant origin. The fact that very few of the protease enzymes used in the production of foodstuffs are produced from plant sources has led researchers to seek a new source of plant-based protease. In the present work, the protease enzyme was isolated from the tubers of the salep orchid (Dactylorhiza osmanica) by ammonium sulphate precipitation and size exclusion chromatography. The isolated protease had an optimal pH of 6.5 and an optimal temperature of 48°C. The Km value was 8.22 M. The molecular mass of the enzyme was 31 kDa. The enzyme retained its 100% activity up to 21 h at 40°C. At 50°C, the enzyme maintained its 100% activity for up to 4 h. The isolated protease acquired from the salep orchid tubers hydrolysed alpha-, beta-, and kappa-casein, and formed new peptides larger than 15 kDa. The isolated enzyme is known to be effective in milk clotting, which is the first step of cheese making, and might also contribute to the production of cheese with specific flavours. However, the protease extracted from the salep orchid tubers cannot hydrolyse gluten at the same level.										2021	28	4	672	681	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-12-Pj6859

High-power ultrasound on the protein stability of white wines: preliminary study of amplitude and sonication time.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					White wines can be negatively affected by the formation of an undesirable protein haze. This sensory defect is prevented by specific fining agents, principally bentonite, which can negatively affect wine sensory characteristics through the removal of color and aroma compounds. Recent studies have focused on the potential application of ultrasound in the food industry, aimed to modify the protein conformations and functional properties for several purposes. The effect of amplitude (30%, 60%, and 90%) and sonication time (5 and 10 min) on the protein stability of two different white wines was evaluated and then compared with bentonite fining in this study. Significant effects of sonication were found. Higher amplitude and treatment time induced an increase in protein stability, confirmed by the lower heat test value (0.360.14), comparable to that obtained after bentonite fining of untreated wine (0.120.02). Positive effects were detected on protein charge neutralization and surface electrical charges, thus suggesting some positive conformational changes of wine proteins. Ultrasound could be considered as a technology to prevent protein precipitation and to reduce the quantity of fining agents used by wineries, but their effectiveness could be strictly related to the initial protein profile.

J		Cen Song; Qing Yu; Esther Jose; Jun Zhuang; He Geng							A hybrid recommendation approach for viral food based on online reviews.		Foods					Nowadays, there are many types of viral foods and consumers expect to be able to quickly find foods that meet their own tastes. Traditional recommendation systems make recommendations based on the popularity of viral foods or user ratings. However, because of the different sentimental levels of users, deviations occur and it is difficult to meet the user's specific needs. Based on the characteristics of viral food, this paper constructs a hybrid recommendation approach based on viral food reviews and label attribute data. A user-based recommendation approach is combined with a content-based recommendation approach in a weighted combination. Compared with the traditional recommendation approaches, it is found that the hybrid recommendation approach performs more accurately in identifying the sentiments of user evaluations, and takes into account the similarities between users and foods. We can conclude that the proposed hybrid recommendation approach combined with the sentimental value of food reviews provides novel insights into improving the existing recommendation system used by e-commerce platforms. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cen Zhang; Peng Wang; Jiawen Li; Hui Zhang; Jochen Weiss							Characterization of core-shell nanofibers electrospun from bilayer gelatin/gum Arabic O/W emulsions crosslinked by genipin.		Food Hydrocolloids					Core-shell nanofibers were electrospun from bilayer gelatin/gum arabic corn oil-in-water emulsions crosslinked by genipin. The crosslinking increased the apparent viscosity and induced a predominantly elastic behavior of the emulsions, which favored the formation of a more stable emulsion system and then electrospun fibers with larger diameters. These fibers had improved surface hydrophobic and mechanical properties, and did not thermally decompose until heated to 250 °C, which might be associated with the chemical bonds formed between primary amines on the protein chains. The encapsulation efficiency of corn oil in the fibers at different crosslinking time was higher than 86% without any significant change during 7 days of storage at room temperature. Thus, this work provides a genipin crosslinking strategy to the development of emulsion-based fibrous mats with desired mechanical and surface hydrophobic properties for food applications of bioactive encapsulation and controlled release.

Journal of Dairy Research					In this research communication we report on the diversity of yeast and mould species in 69 samples of milk and different dairy products from three plants located in Umbria, central Italy. Isolates were characterised both macroscopically and microscopically and then identified by PCR and genome sequencing of the ITS region and the D1-D2 domain of the large-subunit rRNA gene for filamentous fungi and yeasts, respectively. Out of the 69 samples analysed, 51 (73.9%) tested positive for the presence of yeasts, whereas moulds were detected in 25 (36.2%) samples. A total of 9 yeast species belonging to 8 different genera and 13 mould species belonging to 6 different genera were isolated. The most common genera isolated were Debaryomyces and Kluyveromyces among the yeasts and Penicillium and Galactomyces among the moulds. Microbiota play a key role in the formation of flavour, aroma, texture and appearance of dairy products. This complex microbial ecosystem includes both cultured and external bacteria, yeasts and moulds. Some of them have an important role in the production of cheeses, whereas others are responsible for dairy product spoilage, resulting in significant food waste and economic losses. Some species can produce mycotoxins, representing a potential hazard for the consumer's safety. This study provides interesting information on the diversity of fungi species in dairy products from central Italy that can be of major importance to identify these products and to develop adequate strategies for fungal spoilage control and consumer safety. © The Author(s), 2021.

J		Cengiz, A.; Schroen, K.; Berton-Carabin, C.							Towards oxidatively stable emulsions containing iron-loaded liposomes: the key role of phospholipid-to-iron ratio.		Foods					To encapsulate soluble iron, liposomes were prepared using unsaturated phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk), leading to high encapsulation efficiencies (82-99%). The iron concentration affected their oxidative stability: at 0.2 and 1 mM ferrous sulfate, the liposomes were stable, whereas at higher concentrations (10 and 48 mM), phospholipid oxidation was considerably higher. When applied in oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions, emulsions with liposomes containing low iron concentrations were much more stable to lipid oxidation than those added with liposomes containing higher iron concentrations, even though the overall iron concentration was similar (0.1 M). Iron-loaded liposomes thus have an antioxidant effect at high phospholipid-to-iron ratio, but act as pro-oxidants when this ratio is too low, most likely as a result of oxidation of the phospholipids themselves. This non-monotonic effect can be of crucial importance in the design of iron-fortified foods. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, the effect of CMC, xanthan gum, and guar gum addition on corn starch solutions and batters formulated with corn starch was determined. Steady and dynamic rheological tests were evaluated. Herschel-Bulkley model provided a good fit for the flow behavior of the solutions and batters. Flow curves showed that all batters and solutions were to be shear-thinning characteristic. A clear difference between G′ and G values of samples were observed. It is observed that adding hydrocolloids in batters that contain corn starch makes them more gelled or become solid regarding the increment of G′ was always greater than G′′. Hydrocolloid addition showed significant changes in the apparent viscosity of solutions and batters at 25 °C. Comparing the hydrocolloids, CMC had the highest apparent viscosity, followed by xanthan and guar. After 55 °C, all batters showed thermo-gelling ability. At the temperature range of 70-80 °C corn starch and CMC mixed batter showed the highest complex viscosity values. Novelty impact statement: We conducted a study considering to create optimum coating dough formulations used in fried products. Rheological tests were evaluated to explore similarities/hidden patterns and there was a clear difference between G′ and G values of both solution and batter samples. Thermo-gelation properties of batters were influenced by the addition of hydrocolloids, especially CMC. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

A novel technique for the reduction of pesticide residues by a combination of low-intensity electrical current and ultrasound applications: a study on lettuce samples.		Food Chemistry					In this study, effects of low-intensity electrical currents (200, 800 and 1400 mA), ultrasound frequencies (24 and 40 kHz) and their combinations were applied at the duration period of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 min for the degradation of captan, thiamethoxam and metalaxyl residues in lettuce samples. Residues of the pesticides were determined by gas chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry and electron capture detector. The results indicated that the combination of low-intensity electrical current and ultrasound was found to be effective for the reduction of the pesticides. The most effective combination was obtained to be current of 1400 mA and ultrasound frequency of 24 kHz at 10 min. Under this circumstance, 92.57, 81.99 and 93.09% of captan, thiamethoxam and metalaxyl residues were decreased, respectively. The findings suggest that the combination of low-intensity electrical current and ultrasound applications has an important potential for the degradation of pesticide residues.

Intensive environmental surveillance plan for Listeria monocytogenes in food producing plants and retail stores of central Italy: prevalence and genetic diversity.		Foods					Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) can persist in food processing environments (FPEs), surviving environmental stresses and disinfectants. We described an intensive environmental monitoring plan performed in Central Italy and involving food producing plants (FPPs) and retail grocery stores (RSs). The aim of the study was to provide a snapshot of the Lm circulation in different FPEs during a severe listeriosis outbreak, using whole genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the genetic diversity of the Lm isolated, evaluating their virulence and stress resistance profiles. A total of 1217 samples were collected in 86 FPEs with 12.0% of positive surfaces at FPPs level and 7.5% at RSs level; 133 Lm isolates were typed by multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) and core genome MLST (cgMLST). Clonal complex (CC) 121 (25.6%), CC9 (22.6%), CC1 (11.3%), CC3 (10.5%), CC191 (4.5%), CC7 (4.5%) and CC31 (3.8%) were the most frequent MLST clones. Among the 26 cgMLST clusters obtained, 5 of them persisted after sanitization and were re-isolated during the follow-up sampling. All the CC121 harboured the Tn6188_qac gene for tolerance to benzalkonium chloride and the stress survival islet SSI-2. The CC3, CC7, CC9, CC31 and CC191 carried the SSI-1. All the CC9 and CC121 strains presented a premature stop codon in the inlA gene. In addition to the Lm Pathogenicity Island 1 (LIPI-1), CC1, CC3 and CC191 harboured the LIPI-3. The application of intensive environmental sampling plans for the detection and WGS analysis of Lm isolates could improve surveillance and early detection of outbreaks. © 2021 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Pecorino is a typical Italian cheese, mostly produced in central and southern Italy regions using ewe raw milk and following traditional procedures. The use of raw milk constitutes a risk linked to the potential survival or multiplication of pathogenic microorganisms, as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). The aim of this study was to compare different Italian traditional Pecorino production methods to determine if there were any phases that could influence the Escherichia coli O157 survival rate, but also if they could negatively influence lactic acid bacteria survival rate, during the phases of production and ripening. Therefore batches of Pecorino cheese were prepared using different production methods, representing the real and typical cheese production in southern and central Italy regions: 1) heating the milk at 37 °C for about 40 min before curding, 2) heating the milk at 60 °C (thermization) for 13 min, so that the alkaline phosphatase reaction is still positive before curding, 3) cooking curd at 41 °C and 4) at 45 °C, both for 5 min. Our results demonstrated that traditional milk treatments different from pasteurization can help but do not eliminate serious microbiological treats, as E. coli O157, especially if the raw milk is heavily contaminated. The heat treatment at 60 °C applied to raw milk was able to decrease the concentration of E. coli O157 of 1.7 log10CFU/ml and, according to the inactivation slope, it would be further reduced prolonging the heating treatment. The results obtained also showed that, during the Pecorino cheese ripening, E. coli O157 was always enumerable for 60 days, remaining detectable after 90 days of ripening.

Agostino, M. d'						Antioxidant efficacy of olive by-product extracts in human colon HCT8 cells.		Foods					The production of olive oil is accompanied by the generation of a huge amount of waste and by-products including olive leaves, pomace, and wastewater. The latter represents a relevant environmental issue because they contain certain phytotoxic compounds that may need specific treatments before the expensive disposal. Therefore, reducing waste biomass and valorizing by-products would make olive oil production more sustainable. Here, we explore the biological actions of extracts deriving from olive by-products including olive pomace (OP), olive wastewater (OWW), and olive leaf (OLs) in human colorectal carcinoma HCT8 cells. Interestingly, with the same phenolic concentration, the extract obtained from the OWW showed higher antioxidant ability compared with the extracts derived from OP and OLs. These biological effects may be related to the differential phenolic composition of the extracts, as OWW extract contains the highest amount of hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol that are potent antioxidant compounds. Furthermore, OP extract that contains a higher level of vanillic acid than the other extracts displayed a cytotoxic action at the highest concentration. Together these findings revealed that phenols in the by-product extracts may interfere with signaling molecules that cross-link several intracellular pathways, raising the possibility to use them for beneficial health effects. © 2020 by the authors.

Journal of Food Quality					Snake fruit (Salacca zalacca (Gaert.) Voss) is a fruit species traditionally cultivated in Indonesia and other Southeast Asian countries. The edible parts of the fruits contain a certain amount of total phenolic, flavonoid, and monoterpenoid compounds, proving them to be their perfect sources. The main goal of this work was to detect, quantify, and identify various phenolic compounds present in snake fruit pulp. Ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled to a Q-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometer was able to detect 19 phenolic compounds in the salak pulp, including 5 flavanols, 6 phenolic acids, 2 flavonols, 1 flavone, and also 5 presumably new phenolic compounds. Among the detected compounds, 11 were reported and quantified for the first time in salak pulp. Chlorogenic acid was by far the most predominant phenolic compound. The next relatively abundant compounds in snake fruit were epicatechin, isoquercetin, neochlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid and procyanidine B2 (levels at ca 5-10mug/g in MeOH extract), syringic acid, and caffeic acid (levels at ca 1mug/g in H2O extract). A significant total phenolic content (257.17muL/mL) and antioxidant activities (10.56muM TE/g of fruit pulp) were determined. In conclusion, S. zalacca fruit has potential to serve as a natural source of phenolic compounds with antioxidative activities which may be associated with their health benefits.

Design, development and evaluation of nanoemulsion containing avocado peel extract with anticancer potential: a novel biological active ingredient to enrich food.		Food Hydrocolloids					A variety of desired biological effects such as anti-inflammation, anti-oxidation and anti-cancer activity have been attributed to polyphenols, such as procyanidins (Proc). The successful development of functional ingredients/products using polyphenols is limited by poor solubility, high instability, low bioavailability, and undesirable organoleptic properties. The avocado peel is a promising source of Proc. Here we report the development, characterization, and evaluation of a nanoemulsion loaded with a procyanidin-rich extract (Proc-Nem) produced from avocado peels. The method for producing the nanoemulsion was environmentally friendly and used safe ingredients. The process produced spheroidal particles of 160 nm, with low polydispersity (PDI≤0.1), negative zeta potential (-50 mV), high encapsulation efficiency of procyanidins (97%) and with a high concentration of nanostructures (4.7*1012 particles/mL). Proc-Nem was stable in salt up to 120 mM, various pH s (2-10), temperatures up to 50 °C and in prolonged storage (90 days). Interestingly, Proc-Nem can be converted to a reconstitutable dry powder. Cellular assays demonstrate that Proc-Nem is a safe ingredient in non-cancerous human cells (HEK293) and shows preferential cytotoxicity in cancer cells (melanoma B16F10 cells). In addition, the nanoformulation prevented cell migration of melanoma cells suggesting an antimetastatic effect. Due to the simplicity, safety, and efficacy of Proc-Nem, we envisage this ingredient as a valuable alternative for food enrichment. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cerit, I.; Demirkol, O.							Application of thiol compounds to reduce acrylamide levels and increase antioxidant activity of French fries.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to examine the effects of thiol compounds, glutathione (GSH), cysteine (CYS) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC), on the color, antioxidant activity, total phenolic, ascorbic acid and acrylamide content of French fries which were fried at 180 °C for 6 min. Three different concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%) of each thiol compound were tested. Sulphite solution was used as a benchmark. According to the results, CYS and NAC solutions increased the antioxidant activity but GSH solution did not affect. The amount of ascorbic acid was highest in CYS (1.0%, 2.0%) and GSH (2.0%) treated samples. Although all pre-treatments decreased the acrylamide content, GSH2.0%, NAC2.0%, CYS (0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0%) provided 62-70% reduction. In addition, acrylamide showed a high correlation with L* (r=-0.82), a* (r=0.84), b* (r=0.77), Delta E (r=0.66), ascorbic acid (r=-0.79) and weak correlation with thiol content (r=-0.45). On the other hand, antioxidant activities had lack of correlation with acrylamide. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	143				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.111165					FSTA:2021-07-Jl9815
J		Cerny, C.; Schlichtherle-cerny, H.; Gibe, R.; Yuan							Furfuryl alcohol is a precursor for furfurylthiol in coffee.		Food Chemistry					This study investigated the role of furfuryl alcohol (FFA) in the formation of furfurylthiol (FFT), the most important odorant in roasted coffee, using in-bean and spiking experiments. Green beans were spiked with FFA, and after roasting FFT was quantified by stable isotope dilution analysis. The FFT level in the roasted beans increased dose-dependently with addition of FFA. Additionally, beans were spiked with isotopically labelled d2-FFA which generated isotopically labelled d2-FFT after roasting. However, no labelled furfural was observed. The results unambiguously show that FFA serves as a precursor of FFT in coffee. On the other hand, the data indicate that furfural stems not from oxidation of FFA and plays no major role as precursor for FFT formation during coffee roasting. The suggested formation pathway leads from FFA to the furfuryl cation, then protein-bound S-furfuryl-L-cysteine and by subsequent elimination to FFT.

Partial replacement of fat and salt in liver pate by addition of Agaricus bisporus and Pleurotus ostreatus flour.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effect of incorporation of 7.5% (hydrated 50/50 w/w) and 10% (hydrated 70/30 w/w) of Agaricus bisporus (Ab) and Pleurotus ostreatus (Po) flours as partial replacers of fat and salts (sodium chloride and phosphates) on physicochemical properties, microbiological and sensory properties of pate was studied during cold storage. Mushroom flours increased moisture, dietary fibre and protein contents improving the nutritional value of pates. Mushroom flour influenced the colour parameters, especially Ab, and gave harder pates in 10% mushroom flour addition. Sensorially, the odour and taste of 7.5% of mushroom flour were considered acceptable, and its addition hydrated in a ratio 50/50 w/w should be the most suitable to improve the nutritional value of this product without significantly affecting the sensory properties. The addition of Ab and Po flours was a feasible strategy to replace fat and salts in pate. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Comprehensive identification of native medium-sized and short bioactive peptides in sea bass muscle.		Food Chemistry					Native peptides from sea bass muscle were analyzed by two different approaches: medium-sized peptides by peptidomics analysis, whereas short peptides by suspect screening analysis employing an inclusion list of exact m/z values of all possible amino acid combinations (from 2 up to 4). The method was also extended to common post-translational modifications potentially interesting in food analysis, as well as non-proteolytic aminoacyl derivatives, which are well-known taste-active building blocks in pseudo-peptides. The medium-sized peptides were identified by de novo and combination of de novo and spectra matching to a protein sequence database, with up to 4077 peptides (2725 modified) identified by database search and 2665 peptides (223 modified) identified by de novo only; 102 short peptide sequences were identified (with 12 modified ones), and most of them had multiple reported bioactivities. The method can be extended to any peptide mixture, either endogenous or by protein hydrolysis, from other food matrices. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Anti-listerial activity of thermophilin 110 and pediocin in fermented milk and whey.		Food Control					Listeria monocytogenes is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for foodborne illness worldwide. Antimicrobial peptides, or bacteriocins, produced by food-grade lactic acid bacteria can serve as preservatives to prevent Listeria's growth in various foods, including dairy products. This study investigated the anti-listerial activities of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria, Streptococcus thermophilus B59671, and Lactobacillus plantarum 076. In vitro studies showed that the concentration of pediocin produced by L. plantarum 076 (2560 AU/mL) inhibited the growth of a six-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes. However, the concentration of thermophilin 110 produced by S. thermophilus B59671 (320 AU/mL) only delayed the growth by ~2 h. Higher concentrations of thermophilin 110 (≥640 AU/mL) suppressed Listeria growth for up to 22 h. Pasteurized skim milk fermented with a co-culture of S. thermophilus B59671 and L. plantarum 076 reduced the number of L. monocytogenes cells by > 4 Log CFU/mL due mainly to the activity of pediocin. The anti-listerial activity was not observed in whey samples collected from pasteurized skim milk fermented with this co-culture but was detected when raw milk was the substrate. Two additional whey preparations, the by-products from commercial bovine and goat raw-milk cheeses, also inhibited Listeria growth and reduced the number of cells following storage at 4 °C for one week. This study showed that a concentrated preparation of thermophilin 110 has potential as an anti-listerial compound. It demonstrated the prospect of using a co-culture of S. thermophilus B59671 and L. plantarum 076 to prevent Listeria contamination in dairy foods. Additionally, results showed that metabolites with antimicrobial activities may be generated during the fermentation of raw milk due to indigenous microflora. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					The common dentex (Dentex dentex (Linnaeus, 1758)) is an iconic fish in the Mediterranean diet. Due to its commercial and organoleptic importance, this sparid is highly appreciated in European markets and is often subjected to species substitution frauds. Comparative mitogenomics is a suitable approach for identifying new and effective barcode markers. This study aimed to find a molecular tag useful for unequivocally discriminating the sparid species D. dentex. The comparison of the complete mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences of 16 sparid species allowed us to highlight the potential of the NAD2 gene for direct identification purposes. Common dentex-specific primers were created and successfully evaluated by end-point and real-rime PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) for several fish species, achieving amplification only in the D. dentex. The method proposed in this study appears fast, simple, and inexpensive and requires affordable instrumentation. This approach provides unambiguous results for the common dentex authentication without the sequencing step. The presence/absence assay for D. dentex can be executed in a few hours of lab work. Therefore, national authorities responsible for food safety and traceability could apply and make full use of DNA-testing methods for deterring operators from false seafood declarations. © 2021 by the authors.

Bioaccessibility of fat-soluble bioactive compounds (FSBC) from avocado fruit as affected by ripening and FSBC composition in the food matrix.		Food Research International					Dried fruit pulp and oil from avocado fruit (Persea americana, Cv Hass) at five different ripening stages were digested in vitro to determine the bioaccessibility of several fat-soluble bioactive compounds (FSBC). Viscosity, particle size, zeta-potential and lipolysis were evaluated and related to the bioaccessibility of the tested compounds. Fatty acids were more bioaccessible than carotenoids and tocopherols. The viscosity of gastrointestinal medium was related to the initial fruit firmness and modulated the bioaccessibility of neoxanthin, violaxanthin, lutein and luteoxanthin, while particle size and zeta-potential influenced the bioaccessibility of fatty acids. Lipolysis degree highly altered the bioaccessibility of luteoxanthin, pheophytin b, and alpha-tocopherol indicating that these digestive events are highly involved in the bioaccessibility of FSBC. In summary, FSBC from avocado fruit are highly bioaccessible, but their bioaccessibility depends on fruit ripening stage and FSBC type and concentration. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					Gluten-free (GF) pasta samples containing rice flour replaced with 0, 5, 10, 15 g/100 g (w/w) of a resistant starch ingredient from annealed sorghum starch (annRS) were formulated. The highest total dietary fiber and RS contents (p< 0.05) were measured in uncooked pasta with 15 g/100 g of annRS addition (15-annRS). After cooking, the 15-annRS pasta was characterized by an RS content of 5.8 g/100 g dry matter, confirming the thermal resistance of annRS. The use of annRS positively influenced the optimal cooking time, the cooking loss, the firmness, and the stickiness of the cooked samples, with not remarkably change in color after cooking. The starch hydrolysis index values decreased as the level of annRS increased. Despite a significant decrease in the overall sensory with increasing levels of annRS, all samples were characterized by a value > 5, which is considered the limit of acceptability. The use of annRS in GF pasta up to 15 g/100 g can contribute to creating GF products with high total dietary fiber content, slowly digestible starch properties, and without drastically compromising the sensory attributes. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparative evaluation of some quality characteristics of sunflower oilseeds (Helianthus annuus L.) through machine learning classifiers.		Food Analytical Methods					Sunflower seeds are rich in oil and oleic acid, thus having valuable nutritional properties. Sunflower is also resistant to dry conditions and can adapt easily to harsh environmental conditions. Physico-chemical properties play a great role in classification, grading, and quality assessment of sunflower seeds. In present study, six different machine learning algorithms (decision tree, DT; random forest, RF; support vector machine, SVM; multiple linear regression, MLR; Naive Bayes, NB; and multilayer perceptron, MLP) were used to evaluate the classification performance for six different sunflower oilseed varieties. Additionally, characteristic properties of the oilseeds were evaluated by multivariate tests (MANOVA) and discriminant analysis. The best accuracy values were recorded as 80.16, 79.68, and 78.89 for RF, SVM, and MLP, respectively, and the lowest MAE value (0.088) was observed in NB. The MANOVA, Wilks' lambda, and Pillai Trace statistics revealed that differences in physical attributes of the sunflower varieties were significant (p< 0.01). Colombi and Transol varieties with the lowest Mahalanobis distances had the similar attributes. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

According to the results, the highest DPPH, ABTS and FRAP antioxidant activity was determined in maize snacks produced by pigmented whole maize grains. The highest total dietary fibre content was determined in blue maize snacks as 26.88 g/100 g, followed by yellow and red maize snacks with 23.35 and 20.28 g/100 g, respectively. The total anthocyanin content of blue and red maize snacks was determined as 49.60 and 4.51 mg CGE/kg; however, it could not be detected in yellow maize snacks. The lowest rapidly available glucose (11.07 g/100 g) and the highest slowly available glucose (16.26 g/100 g) were also obtained in blue maize snack. Snack produced by blue maize grains was classified in low GI foods, while yellow and red maize snacks were classified as medium GI food. This result showed that anthocyanins are more effective in lowering eGI of maize snacks than dietary fibres and phenolics. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cetinkaya, N.; Koc, T. B.; Karabulut, I.							Oxidative stability and in vitro release properties of encapsulated wheat germ oil in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-based microcapsules.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					This research aims to evaluate the feasibility of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-based microencapsulation for wheat germ oil (WGO) based on oxidative stability and in vitro release properties. Microencapsulation of samples is achieved by freeze-drying WGO-in water emulsions containing alive, non-plasmolyzed, and plasmolyzed yeast cells. The encapsulation efficiency (EE), loading capacity (LC), release characteristics, and oxidative stability of WGO are determined before and after microencapsulation. The amount of beta-carotene in the digesta is used to evaluate the release properties. Plasmolyzed yeast cells yield the highest EE (43.1%) and LC (216.5 g kg-1). In cases where alive and non-plasmolyzed yeast cells were used as an encapsulant, a higher release rate was obtained in esophagus-stomach conditions, while higher digestion took place mainly in the duodenum and ileum with plasmolyzed cells. Encapsulation of WGO in plasmolyzed yeast cells provide the lowest peroxide and p-anisidine values and the highest oxidative protection during the accelerated oxidation test at 60°C for 24 days. This result is also confirmed by Rancimat induction time. Practical Applications. Removing the plasma content by plasmolysis changes the structure of the yeast cell membrane and improves the encapsulation ability and release properties. Encapsulation of WGO with plasmolyzed yeast cells provides superiority in oxidative stability compared to native WGO. The potential value of WGO as an ingredient in the preparation of functional foods could be achieved by yeast cell encapsulation. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.		karabulut, ihsan/ABG-7556-2020	karabulut, ihsan/0000-0002-9014-8863							2021	123	10			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202100064					FSTA:2022-02-Ne0291
J		Cetinkaya, T.; Ceylan, Z.; Meral, R.; Kiliser, A.; Altay, F.							A novel strategy for Au in food science: nanoformulation in dielectric, sensory properties, and microbiological quality of fish meat.		Food Bioscience					Fabrication of Au-zein-based nanomats (AuZ-Nm) was successfully carried out by using the electrospinning technique. The average diameters of Au were found as 530 377 nm within zein nanomats having 161 45 nm. The nanomats were used to delay the Total Mesophilic Aerobic Bacteria (TMAB) growth in the skinless fish fillets stored at 4 1 °C. Besides control samples, dielectric properties (epsilon′ and epsilon") of the skinless fish fillets treated with AuZ-Nm were revealed. During the 8-days-storage, sensory changes in the samples treated with AuZ-Nm were determined. Microbiological test demonstrated that the use of AuZ-Nm limited the TMAB growth up to ~1 log CFU/g (p < 0.05). epsilon′ values of the fish samples treated with AuZ-Nm (changes from 76.47 to 54.29) were more stable as compared to untreated fish samples (p < 0.05). The changes in epsilon" for control and nanotreated samples were 86.94% and 77.92%. The overall acceptability of the nanotreated samples was higher than the control samples. The stability of dielectric properties, limitation of microbiological spoilage, and also delaying of sensory deterioration of the fish fillets could be provided by using AuZ-Nm. In this respect, the use of Au-zein-based nanomats in the present study with the results could be playing a guiding role for further food studies. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cetinkaya, T.; Altay, F.; Ceylan, Z.							A new application with characterized oil-in-water-in-oil double emulsions: gelatin-xanthan gum complexes for the edible oil industry.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A novel oil-in-water-in-oil (O1/W/O2) double emulsion (DE) system was successfully created to decrease the saturated fat content. DEs stabilized with gelatin (GL), xanthan gum (XG), and solid fat crystals were generated using a two-stage emulsification process. Primary emulsions (PEs) containing 60 g/100 g and 20 g/100 g sunflower oil (SFO) were prepared with constant GL (at 1 g/100 g) and XG (at 0.6 g/100 g and 1.4 g/100 g) of the total emulsion, respectively. DEs at constant water concentrations containing SFO at 30, 38.3, 46.7, and 55 g/100 g and different water concentrations at 30, 40, 45, and 60 g/100 g were examined. The DE microstructure showed that SFO was encapsulated in internal water droplets, which were stabilized by interfacial accumulation of fat crystals. The hardness value of the DEs decreased from 13.40 to 3.42 N with increasing SFO. Amplitude and frequency sweep tests revealed a weak gel structure and elastic behavior of DEs. In addition, a decrease in gel stiffness was observed with an increase in SFO and water content. The results of the present study effectively demonstrated a new approach applicable for the edible oil industry, formulating O1/W/O2 DEs using a natural emulsifier (GL) and a stabilizer (XG).

Development of kafirin-based nanocapsules by electrospraying for encapsulation of fish oil.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Kafirin-based fish oil nanocapsules were successfully obtained by using electrospraying technique. A kafirin isolate containing mostly alpha-kafirins, but also gamma-and beta-kafirins, was used as shell material. Electrospraying solutions with 10 wt% kafirin and fish oil (20 wt% with respect to kafirin) led to the production of nanocapsules (552 and 861 nm) when electrosprayed at 20-25 kV voltage with flow rates ranging from 0.5 to 1 mL/h. Neither the flow rate nor the voltage had a significant effect (p > 0.05) on the average diameter of the kafirin electrosprayed capsules loaded with fish oil. The encapsulation efficiency of the nanocapsules was up to 94.02.5%, indicating that most of the fish oil was encapsulated within the kafirin shell. These results suggest the feasibility of obtaining kafirin-based capsules for the encapsulation of fish oil by electrospraying. This will open up new possibilities for kafirin as hydrophobic shell material for the production of fish oil encapsulates, which can be applied to the fortification with omega-3 fatty acids of food matrices.

J		Cevik, M.							Electrical conductivity and performance evaluation of verjuice concentration process using ohmic heating method.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The verjuice sample (14.5 0.2% total soluble solid [TSS] content) was concentrated (at 102 2 °C evaporation temperature) until reach 50% TSS content by applying ohmic heating at 13, 15, 17, and 19V/cm voltage gradients. The total process times up to 50% TSS content were determined as 2,100, 1,500, 1,200, and 1,020s for 13, 15, 17, and 19V/cm, respectively. The electrical conductivity values increased until reach 32% TSS content and then showed a decrease until the final TSS content. The total energy consumption values increased as the voltage gradient decreased. The total power and specific water removal ratio (SWRR) values decreased as the voltage gradient decreased. The efficiency of ohmic heating assisted concentration process increased with the applied voltage gradient and it ranged from 71.27 to 75.22%. By evaluating the effects of ohmic heating conditions applied in the present study on total process time, total energy consumption, and process efficiency, 19V/cm voltage gradients could be recommended to be optimum evaporation conditions of verjuice concentration in case of decreasing process time and higher energy efficiency. Practical applications. Fruit juices are generally concentrated to extend their shelf life. Therefore, for concentration purposes, various techniques, such as thermal evaporation, freezing methods, and membrane techniques, are applied in the fruit juice industry. This technique has some disadvantages, such as high energy requirements, the formation of undesirable compounds, high initial investment cost, and high failure rate to reach the desired total soluble solid content. The ohmic heating method, which is among the alternative heating methods, has advantages such as high energy efficiency, shorter processing time, higher product quality, and not causing wastewater. As a result of this study, it is thought that the verjuice samples were successfully concentrated up to 50% TSS content by using the ohmic heating method and this method can be used as an alternative method instead of the traditional method due to higher process efficiency and shorter process time. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Cevik, M.; Icier, F.							Comparison of quality attributes of minced beef samples thawed by ohmic and conventional methods.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Frozen minced meat samples having different fat contents (2%, 10%, or 18%) were thawed using two different standard thawing methods (RT: +4 °C refrigeration thawing, URWT: +4 °C under running water thawing), and a novel alternative method (ohmic thawing-OT at voltage gradients of 10, 13, and 16 V/cm). The drip loss values of meat samples changed in the range of 0.01%-1.65%. For OT, the change in the color increased as the fat content increased. OT shortened the thawing time, on average, by 64% and 87% compared to URWT and RT, respectively, while it resulted in similar effects on proximate composition and microbiological load with standard thawing methods. This novel thawing method did not cause any mutagenic formation, and the metal migration was in allowable limits. It is thought that the results showed that OT method has the potential to be applied as a novel alternative method for thawing of meat products. Practical applications. For long-term storage of meat and meat products, freezing is commonly used. However, frozen food must be thawed before use. For this reason, two different conventional thawing methods were recommended by US-FDA. However, conventional thawing methods have some disadvantages such as long process times, high energy consumptions, and waste water formation. Ohmic thawing has shorter process time, high energy efficiency, and does not produce any waste water. In this study, frozen minced meat samples (with fat content of 2%, 10%, or 18%) were thawed using different thawing conditions (RT, URWT, and OT at voltage gradients of 10, 13, and 16 V/cm). OT shortened the thawing time. Drip loss was found to be high for OT. The effect of OT on microbiological load and proximate composition was not different from conventional thawing. OT method did not cause any mutagenic formation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Ceylan, H.; Bilgicli, N.; Cankurtaran, T.							Improvement of functional cake formulation using Jerusalem artichoke flour as inulin source and resistant starch (RS4).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, wheat flour in cake formulation was replaced with resistant starch (RS), Jerusalem artichoke flour (JAF) and RS+ JAF combination at the rate of 10,20, 30 and 40%, and cake production was conducted with and without guar gum. The effects of guar gam, RS and JAF as individual and in combination on some physical, chemical and sensory cake properties were determined. The use of RS at high ratios, or JAF and RS+ JAF combination over 10% ratios in cake formulation, decreased volume and symmetry index and increased hardness of the cake samples. The utilization of guar gum increased both the volume index and hardness of the cake samples. When JAF was used as an individual or in combination in cake formulation, crust and crumb L* and b* color values of cake reduced. JAF increased ash, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity, Ca, K and Mg contents of cake samples from 1.52 g/100 g, 2778 mg GAE/kg, 17.9%, 44.1 mg/100 g, 141.3 mg/100 g and 17.7 mg/100 g up to 2.07 g/100 g, 4506 mg GAE/kg, 33.6%, 55.9 mg/100 g, 343.7 mg/100 g and 25.6 mg/100 g, respectively. RS+ JAF combination showed similar trend with JAF in terms of enrichment of cake samples.

J		Ceylan, M. M.; Bulut, M.; Alwazeer, D.							Improvement of pasting and textural properties of sunn-damaged wheat flour using tea waste extracts.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The sunn pest forms a serious risk to wheat by degrading its pasting and textural properties. The addition of tea waste extract to improving the pasting, rheological, and textural properties of the sunn pest-infected flour was investigated. The effects of the addition of different extract concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) of black tea (BT), black tea waste (BTW), green tea (GT), and green tea waste (GTW) as well as L-ascorbic acid on the pasting, rheological, and textural properties of sunn-infected wheat flour were investigated. The addition of 4% tea extract showed the highest improving impact with the best-recovering effect found for GTW extract. Both GT and GTW extracts enhanced pasting and textural properties better than those of BT. The tea wastes could be valorized as a green method for solving the problem of the weak pasting and textural properties of sunn-damaged wheat flour. Novelty impact statement. Extracts of tea wastes improved the pasting and textural properties of the sunn-damaged wheat flour. Tea waste extract provides nutritional benefits for consumers and exhibits an additional value of industrial wastes for the benefits of both environment and industries. This solution could be considered as a green method because it depends on the use of antioxidant-rich extracts of plant wastes known generally as eco-friendly natural additives and alternatives of synthetic ones. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Protective effect of grape seed oil-loaded nanofibers: limitation of microbial growth and lipid oxidation in kashar cheese and fish meat samples.		Food Bioscience					Grape seed oil-loaded nanofibers (gsN) having 414.8 58.7 nm diameter were fabricated using the electrospinning technique. Scanning electron microscopy images, encapsulation efficiency (92.4%), and molecular characterization analysis (FTIR) proved successful production of electrospun gsN. Limitation in total mesophilic aerobic bacteria count (TMABc) of kashar and fish meat samples coated with grape seed oil-loaded nanofibers and then stored at cold storage conditions was found in the range of 1.40 and 1.53 log during the experimental period. Coating with gsN as compared to the control group samples for each sample delayed rapid total yeast and mold growth in kashar (28%) and fish meat samples (20%) (p < 0.05). TBA value of fish control samples was increased from 1.38 to 2.06 mg MDA/kg in fish control samples and 1.65 mg MDA/kg in fish meat coated with gsN. In addition to fish samples, at the end of the 20th day, while the initial TBA value was determined as 1.32 mg MDA/kg, it reached 2.45 in kashar control samples and 2.18 mg MDA/kg in kashar coated with gsN. In this respect, besides microbiological limitation, grape seed oil nanofiber coating was found to be highly effective against the rapid oxidation in fish and kashar samples stored at 4 1°C (p < 0.05). The use of grape seed oil within nanoformulation effectively provided obtaining higher quality products having two different matrices in the food industry. Therefore, this nano methodology provided with the electrospinning technique could play a guiding role for different food products in the industry as well.

J		Chaaban, N.; Hoier, A. T. Z. B.; Andersen, B. V.							A detailed characterisation of appetite, sensory perceptional, and eating-behavioural effects of COVID-19: self-reports from the acute and post-acute phase of disease.		Foods					Sensory perception alterations are common in relation to COVID-19 disease, but less is known about the characteristic of the sensory alterations, and how they associate with alterations in appetite and eating behaviour. The current study aims to investigate the acute and long-term effects of COVID-19 disease on (1) the desire for food, hunger, and satiety sensations; (2) smell, taste, and flavour perception; (3) meals and intake of food types; and (4) the frequency of commonly applied strategies to tackle potential changes in appetite and sensory perception. An online survey was conducted among Danish adults (n = 102) who had experienced changes in appetite, sensory perception, and/or food-related pleasure due to COVID-19 disease. Key results include appetite-altering effects at all times during the day when suffering from COVID-19 and often associated with impaired sensory function. Severe sensory perception alterations were found, namely, for the perception of taste, ageusia > hypogeusia > hypergeusia, and for the perception of smell, anosmia > parosmia > hyposmia > hyperosmia. Eating behavioural changes included alteration in quantitative and qualitative aspects of intake. The effects were, in general, more pronounced during the acute phase of disease than during the post-acute phase. The findings illustrate the complexity by which COVID-19 affects human appetite, sensory perception, and eating behaviour, but also point to strategies to cope with these changes. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chaaban, N.; Andersen, B. V.							Sensory specific desires. The role of sensory taste exposure in desire for food with a similar or different taste profile.		Foods					The present study investigated how the sensory taste profile of a meal altered the subjective desire, wanting and liking of foods with a sweet, salty, sour, bitter, fatty, and spicy sensory profile, respectively. Participants (n = 85) ate a meal with a pronounced sensory taste profile: (1) sweet, (2) salty, or (3) sweet and salty combined. Self-reports of appetite, pleasantness, and sensory specific desires (SSD) were evaluated over the course of the meal using VAS-scales. SSDs were further studied through alterations in liking and desire for food samples with the main sensory profile being sweet (peach), salty (pretzel), sour (green apple), bitter (dark chocolate), fatty (whipped cream), and spicy (chilli nut), respectively. Consumption of food with a pronounced sensory taste profile was found to suppress the desire for food with a similar sensory taste profile, while the desire for different sensory profiles were enhanced or not affected. Further, when exposed to two pronounced tastes within the same meal, suppression of sensory desires was not only specific for the exposure tastes but tended to go beyond the sensory exposure. The findings suggest that taste variation within a meal holds the potential to create more satisfying meals, which can hinder additional desires after a meal and thus, lower additional calorie intake. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chaboud, G.; Moustier, P.							The role of diverse distribution channels in reducing food loss and waste: the case of the Cali tomato supply chain in Colombia.		Food Policy					Food loss and waste (FLW) in developing countries is often high at postharvest stages due to technical and infrastructural constraints, while supermarket expansion has induced organizational, institutional and technological changes in the agrifood supply chains. Here we assess the volume of FLW along a food supply chain (FSC) and analyze the roles that supermarket and non-supermarket channels play in dealing with FLW. The study is based on primary data collected along a tomato chain-from production to retailing-in Cali (Colombia). The results revealed relatively low FLW due to: 1) the diversity of consumer preferences, 2) the reduced harvest-to-sale time, 3) the marketing strategies adopted to sell downgraded and damaged products, and 4) the overlap and complementarity between supermarket and non-supermarket channels. The study highlights the importance of preserving the diversity of these marketing channels to avoid unsold food products, meet the range of consumers' needs, while providing greater marketing opportunities for farmers.

J		Chae Yeon Lim; Hyojin Kim; Mi Sook Chung							Mori Cortex Radicis extract inhibits human norovirus surrogate in simulated digestive conditions.		Food Science and Biotechnology					Norovirus is a major cause of acute gastroenteritis globally, resulting in enormous health and societal costs. In this study, the antiviral activities of Mori Cortex Radicis (MCR) extract and its bioactive flavonoids, morusin and kuwanon G, were tested against Murine norovirus (MNV), a human norovirus surrogate, using plaque assay. The antiviral activity was confirmed in simulated digestive conditions, including simulated saliva fluid (SSF), simulated gastric fluid (SGF), and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). Pre-treatment of MNV with MCR extract at 1000 g/mL showed antiviral activity with a 1.1-log reduction. Morusin and kuwanon G also demonstrated a 1.0-log and 0.6-log reductions of MNV titers, respectively, at 100 M. MCR extract at a concentration of 2 mg/mL in SSF, SGF, and SIF markedly reduced MNV titers by 1.8, 1.9, and 1.5 logs, respectively. Therefore, these data suggest that MCR extract can be used to control norovirus infectivity. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	9	1243	1248	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00958-0					FSTA:2022-01-Aj0192

Journal of Functional Foods					The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of Prasiola japonica ethanol extract (Pj-EE) in various mouse inflammation models. For edema mice models, eight-week-old female ICR mice were orally administrated with Pj-EE (25 and 50mg/kg) for one week, before ear edema induction with carrageenan or xylene. The weight, thickness, and volume of paw and ear edema were decreased in Pj-EE-treated mice after 3h of edema induction. The mRNA expression levels of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, IL-1beta, and IFN-gamma were decreased in Pj-EE-treated conditions. The phosphorylation forms of IkappaBalpha and IKKalpha/beta were suppressed by Pj-EE at 50mg/kg. The effect of Pj-EE on gastrointestinal disorder was examined in HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis model. Oral administration of Pj-EE ameliorated HCl/EtOH-stimulated gastric ulcers. In addition, Pj-EE reduced gene expressions of iNOS, COX-2, IL-6, and IL-1beta. Alverine, one of ingredient compounds in Pj-EE, was also confirmed to show anti-edema activity, in vitro, and in vivo. Conclusively, therapeutic effects of Pj-EE were demonstrated in various inflammatory mouse models, suggesting a possibility as a promising anti-inflammatory functional food.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					In the present study, we evaluated the antimicrobial activity of passion fruit peel extract (PPE) against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes. The application of PPE using an electrostatic spraying system for the disinfection of fresh-cut Lollo Rossa and beetroot leaves was also examined and compared with conventional PPE washing. Time-kill assays indicated that PPE had antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes, effectively reducing the populations of the pathogenic bacteria within 3 h following treatment with 6 mg/mL PPE. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed that PPE treatment caused bacterial cell death by damaging the cell membrane. PPE treatment produced significant decontamination against the pathogens on fresh-cut vegetables. Electrostatic spraying of 6 mg/mL PPE for 20 s decreased the populations of pathogenic bacteria on Lollo Rossa and beetroot leaves by 2.29-2.86 log CFU/g, regardless of the difference in the contact angle and surface roughness of the vegetables. Our results showed that electrostatic spraying of PPE was more effective than washing with PPE.

Food Control					The aim of this study was to examine the washing effect of the positively charged emulsion produced by the combination of peanut skin extract (PSE) and benzethonium chloride (BEC) against Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7 on fresh-cut romaine lettuce. PSE and BEC showed a good washing effect regardless of pathogenic bacteria type. Specifically, the combination of 5 mg/mL PSE and 0.5 mg/mL BEC (PSE-BEC) resulted in 3.06 and 2.83 log reductions in L. monocytogenes and E. coli O157:H7 populations inoculated on romaine lettuce leaves, respectively, compared to washing with water alone. Further, the PSE-BEC treatment-induced reduction in the levels of these two pathogenic bacteria was greater than that with 0.2 mg/mL sodium hypochlorite. SEM analysis revealed a decrease in the number of bacteria and a change in cell membrane morphology on the lettuce surface following PSE-BEC treatment. Moreover, analysis of contact angle and particle characteristics (i.e.zeta-potential, particle size, and polydispersity index) of the washing solution indicated a correlation between the washing effect and the physicochemical characteristics of the PSE-BEC solution. Furthermore, washing with PSE-BEC did not change the quality of lettuce leaves during storage. These results suggest that PSE-BEC has the potential to be used as an effective washing agent for freshly cut romaine lettuce as an alternative to chlorine-based sanitizers.

J		Chae-Lim Lee; Geun-Hyang Kim; Ki-Sun Yoon							Effects of combined aerosolization with ultraviolet C light-emitting diode on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus attached to soft fresh produce.		Foods					Washing soft fresh produce such as strawberries, baby leaves, and sliced onions with sanitizing agents is challenging due to their fragile texture. Thus, treatments like aerosolization using slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) and ultraviolet C light-emitting diode (UVC LED) irradiation may be good alternatives. In the present study, the reduction effects of a combined treatment of aerosolization using SAEW and UVC LED irradiation on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and Staphylococcus aureus attached to strawberries, baby leaves, and sliced onions were investigated. The behaviours of EHEC and S. aureus, moisture loss, colour measurement, and visual appearance were also analyzed at 10 and 15°C for 7 days. The reduction effect of the combined treatment with 100 SAEW and UVC LED was higher (0.53-0.92 log CFU g-1) than a single aerosolization treatment (0.11-0.41 log CFU g-1), regardless of samples or pathogens. A greater effect on EHEC and S. aureus reduction was observed in strawberries (0.74 and 0.92 log CFU g-1) than in baby leaves (0.62 and 0.53 log CFU g-1) and sliced onions (0.55 and 0.62 log CFU g-1). The combined treatment further reduced the EHEC and S. aureus populations in strawberries during 7 days of storage at 10 and 15°C. However, the EHEC and S. aureus populations were maintained in baby leaves and sliced onions at 10 °C for 7 days. Additionally, the greatest effect on the maintenance of colour and appearance was obtained in the combined treatment. Since the combined treatment reduces EHEC and S. aureus populations and preserves visual quality, it could be expected to extend the shelf life of soft fresh produce at the retailer stage of the supply chain. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chae-Min Han; Jong-Hee Shin; Jung-Bae Kwon; Jong-Soo Kim; Jong-Gun Won; Jong-Sang Kim							Comparison of morphological and physicochemical properties of a floury rice variety upon pre-harvest sprouting.		Foods					Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) severely reduces rice grain yield, significantly affects grain quality, and leads to substantial economic loss. In this study, we aimed to characterize the physicochemical properties and processing quality of the Garumi 2 flour rice variety under PHS conditions and compare them with those of the Seolgaeng, Hangaru, Shingil, and Ilpum rice varieties and the Keumkang wheat variety. Analysis of the molecular structure of starch revealed uniform starch granules, increased proportions of short-chain amylopectin in DP 6-12 (51.0-55.3%), and enhanced crystallinity (30.7-35.7%) in rice varieties for flour compared with the Ilpum cooking rice variety. PHS significantly altered the starch structure and gelatinization properties of Garumi 2. It also caused surface pitting and roughness in Garumi 2 starch granules and decreased their crystallinity. Collectively, the findings of this study provide important novel insights into the effects of PHS on the physicochemical properties of Garumi 2 floury rice for flour. © 2021 by the authors.

A. de							Enrichment of antioxidants compounds in cookies produced with camu-camu (Myrciaria dubia) coproducts powders.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Camu-camu processing coproducts can present a high concentration of bioactive compounds with antioxidant characteristics. However, the application of these coproducts in food products is little explored. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of different drying temperatures on camu-camu coproducts in relation to the bioactive compound concentration and the effect of substitution of wheat flour by this coproduct on the characteristics of cookies. Camu-camu coproducts were dried at 50 °C, 60 °C and 70 °C and evaluated for proximate composition, phenolic profile and the total phenolic and antioxidant potential (DPPH, FRAP, ORAC assays). Cookies were produced with 5%-20% replacement of wheat flour by the coproduct powder and characterized in relation to hardness, spreading factor, specific volume and the total phenolic and antioxidant potential. The camu-camu coproduct powder dried at 70 °C showed the highest concentration of total phenolic and antioxidant potential. A total of 11 flavonoids were identified for camu-camu coproduct regardless of drying temperature. The incorporation of camu-camu coproduct powder, with a maximum substitution of 20%, did not affect the physical properties of the cookies when compared to the control cookies, improving total phenolics and antioxidant potential, confirming a possible to insert this coproduct in food industry.

J		Chaher, N. E. H.; Nassour, A.; Hamdi, M.; Nelles, M.							Monitoring of food waste anaerobic digestion performance: conventional co-substrates vs. unmarketable biochar additions.		Foods					This study proposed the selection of cost-effective additives generated from different activity sectors to enhance and stabilize the start-up, as well as the transitional phases, of semi-continuous food waste (FW) anaerobic digestion. The results showed that combining agricultural waste mixtures including wheat straw (WS) and cattle manure (CM) boosted the process performance and generated up to 95% higher methane yield compared to the control reactors (mono-digested FW) under an organic loading rate (OLR) range of 2 to 3 kg VS/m3.d. Whereas R3 amended with unmarketable biochar (UBc), to around 10% of the initial fresh mass inserted, showed a significant process enhancement during the transitional phase, and more particularly at an OLR of 4 kg VS/m3.d, it was revealed that under these experimental conditions, FW reactors including UBc showed an increase of 144% in terms of specific biogas yield (SBY) compared to FW reactors fed with agricultural residue. Hence, both agricultural and industrial waste were efficacious when it came to boosting either FW anaerobic performance or AD effluent quality. Although each co-substrate performed under specific experimental conditions, this feature provides decision makers with diverse alternatives to implement a sustainable organic waste management system, conveying sufficient technical details to draw up appropriate designs for the recovery of various types of organic residue. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Rice cake is a traditional food in Korea, and is made by rice alone, or with other grain powder. To improve the health benefits of fermented rice cake, the rice powder was supplemented with strawberry powder. Anti-inflammatory activities of the mixture of strawberry and rice powder were evaluated. Treatment with the mixture significantly decreased the production of nitric oxide (NO). The mixture of strawberry and rice powder in the ratio 10: 90 effectively and dose-dependently reduced the immune-associated genes iNOS, IL-1beta, IL-6, COX-2, and TNF-alpha. Furthermore, carrageenan-injected mice were used to study the anti-inflammatory effect of the mixture. Pre-oral administration of the mixture of strawberry and rice powder at doses of 50 and 100 mg/kg BW significantly reduced paw edema induced by carrageenan. These results suggest that for fermented rice cake production and processing, the strawberry and rice powder mixture may be a potential source of anti-inflammatory activity. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	11	1409	1416	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00929-5					FSTA:2022-03-Mq1276

Foods					The cluster of metabolic disorders includes obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and glucose intolerance, increasing the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and type 2 diabetes. Evolving proofs suggest an essential role of microbiota in human health and disease, including digestion, energy and glucose metabolism, immunomodulation, and brain function. The frequency of overweight is increasing, and the main causes for this are highly processed foods and less active lifestyles. Research is underway to unravel the probable relationship between obesity and intestinal microbiota. Here, we propose a method to understand and elucidate the synergistic function of prebiotics and probiotics in treating obesity. The biomarkers of obesity, such as cholesterol, gut permeability, oxidative stress, bacterial toxins, cytokines, and short-chain fatty acids, were analyzed in Thai obese individuals after being supplemented with a synbiotic preparation containing Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium breve, inulin, and fructooligosaccharide. The results reveal that the supplementation of synbiotics significantly altered the obesity-associated biomarkers in an appositive way. Further studies are warranted to use synbiotics as an adjuvant therapy for the management of obesity-related health issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Chajecka-Wierzchowska, W.; Zarzecka, U.; Zadernowska, A.							Enterococci isolated from plant-derived food-analysis of antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of resistance genes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study analyzed phenotypic and molecular resistance to tetracyclines, macrolides, glycopeptides, aminoglycosides in Enterococcus strains isolated from plant-derived food. The study involved examining 270 food samples and 72 obtained Enterococcus sp. Strains were isolated and identified as E. Faecium, E. faecalis and E. casseliflavus.Most of them (55.6%) were resistant to streptomycin, followed by those resistant to rifampicin (51.4%), tigecycline (37.5%), erythromycin (36.1%) and fosfomycin (27.8%). More than half of the strains under analysis showed the high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) phenotype (55.6%). Resistance to aminoglycosides was associated mainly with the presence of the ant (6′)-Ia gene (54.2%), followed by the aph (3′)-IIIa gene (30.5%), and-to a small extent-with the presence of the aac (6′)-Ie-aph (2)-la gene (8.3%). Resistance to tetracycline was caused mainly by the tetM (40.3%) and tetL (22.2%) genes and to macrolides-by ermB (33.3%) and ermA (11.1%). A conjugative transposon of the Tn 916/Tn 1545 family was present in nearly half (45.8%) of the isolates. The findings show that there is a need to monitor plant-derived food for the presence of antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus strains, because it can be a potential reservoir of genes encoding resistance to clinically important antibiotics.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					To investigate how flour affects crumb structures, we used Synchrotron X-ray tomography to scan and capture the growth of gas bubbles in leavened and unleavened bread doughs of two different flours. Bubbles were mobile in all doughs; they coalesced and disproportionated with the rate of coalescence being higher in leavened doughs. In unleavened dough, new bubbles were detected, attributed to arise from poro-visco-elastic relaxation of gluten as dough rested. In each yeasted dough, a single, massively inter-connected cluster formed which percolated at ~26% dough porosity irrespective of flour type in dough. Following percolation, dough expansion was driven primarily by growth of the percolating bubble. Between flours, the rate of coalescence was higher in Wylkatchem (Wylk), an Australian flour dough, than in Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) flour dough, known for superior proof and bake qualities. How the physical and rheological properties of dough liquors could have affected the stabilities of bubbles in these doughs have been discussed.

Journal of Food Quality					Mangosteen fruit has a high potential on the global fruit market, but some disorders, including translucent flesh, are major problems of fruit quality, limiting the marketability. The present study was conducted to compare physiological changes of reactive oxygen species (ROS), cellular lignification between translucent and normal aril, and elucidate the relation. Mangosteen fruits at purple peel color were collected from eastern Thailand during the middle of the rainy season of 2019. Translucent aril accumulated higher lignin content in the tissues, expressing firmer texture ten times higher than normal aril. Lignification was increased in translucent aril by 740% and 25% higher coniferyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and peroxidase (POD) activity, respectively, induced by high H2O2. Healthy aril performed higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) (8.5 times) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) (1.3 times) to those in translucent aril. Furthermore, the higher flavonoid content, ascorbic acid content, and antioxidant capacities detected in normal aril could significantly reduce oxidative stress. Although containing high antioxidant systems, healthy aril was found to accumulate higher malonaldehyde content (MDA). This study provides intensive evidence of oxidative stress and the defensive systems between normal and translucent tissues.

Journal of Food Safety					A nanogold-based immunochromatographic strip test (VCG strip test) for the detection of all 70 isolates of Vibrio cholerae including O1, O139, and non-O1/O139 (NVCs) was developed using two monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), namely VC-63 and VC-201, which bound specifically to 10 and 15kDa proteins. Direct detection of V. cholerae in experimentally spiked fresh seafood samples such as shrimp, blood clam, mussel, and oyster could be achieved with sensitivities of 107 CFU/ml, which was similar to that of the dot blotting test using each MAb. The detection sensitivity could be improved to 103 or 10 or 1CFU/ml of original bacterial content after preincubation of the sample in alkaline peptone water for 6,12, and 24hr consecutively. However, the detection sensitivities were also dependent on the content of other bacteria in the sample that might compete or inhibit the growth of V. cholerae during the preenrichment step. Due to its broad specificity, simplicity and rapid result generation, the VCG strip test can be used for the preliminary detection of V. cholerae at point of care for both environmental and clinical strains to assist appropriate decision or epidemiological surveillance of virulent V. cholerae strains (including NVC strains), which are ubiquitous in the environment and seafood. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	1			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12874					FSTA:2021-06-Ra2086

Effect of drying and grinding or micro-grinding process on physical and rheological properties of whole cladode (Opuntia ficus-indica) flour.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cactus (Opuntia ficus-indica) cladodes are a source of dietary fiber, vitamins and antioxidants that could be utilized by the food industry for both their nutritional and technological properties. In the present study, cladodes were dried at 45°C for 24 h, followed by a 18 h vacuum drying at 45°C or 60°C. The dried cladodes were then ground in a grain mill, resulting in two coarse cladode flours (C45 and C60, respectively). A portion of the two flours was further ground with jet mill, yielding two fine flours, J45 and J60, respectively. Color, bulk density, water and oil holding capacities, solubility and dietary fiber content were determined. In addition, rheological properties and sedimentation kinetic of aqueous cladode flour suspensions were evaluated. An increase of insoluble fiber was observed with micro-grinding. All samples exhibited shear thinning behavior, while jet milling led to substantial decrease in apparent viscosity values. Coarse fractions sedimented quickly, achieving almost maximum sedimentation within 10 min, while the micro ground samples sedimented half as fast. In conclusion, particle size significantly alters the technological properties of cladode flour, broadening the range of applications cladodes could be used for. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Chalyy, Z.; Kiseleva, M.; Sedova, I.; Tutelyan, V.							Mycotoxins in herbal tea: transfer into the infusion.		World Mycotoxin Journal					Mycotoxins are natural food contaminants, associated with adverse health effects due to acute intoxication and, what is much more common, chronic exposure. The most hazardous and widespread mycotoxins are subjected to regulation in food in most countries. Alongside with regulated, a wide list of mycotoxins is monitored in various foods. Traditionally mycotoxins in tea are determined in a dry sample, not taking into account their transfer rate into the infusion. This study was aimed at the determination of the transfer rate of several mycotoxins from naturally contaminated herbal tea samples into an infusion. Seven of the most contaminated samples were pre-selected during the monitoring of mycotoxins in Camellia sinensis and herbal tea available in the Russian Federation. Ochratoxin A (OTA), sterigmatocystin (STE), mycophenolic acid (MPA), tentoxin (TTX), alternariol (AOH), its methyl ether (AME), zearalenone (ZEN), enniatins A and B (ENN A and B), beauvericin (BEA) were detected in these samples in the range of several mug/kg to several mg/kg. HPLC-MS/MS was used for dry tea samples and their infusion analysis. Mycotoxin polarity and infusion pH (for analytes possessing carboxylic groups) appeared to be factors determining transfer rate. STE transferred into infusion at the average rate of 10%. Average transfer of Alternaria toxins varied from 73% (TTX) to 45% (AOH) and about 11% (AME). A third part of ZEN was detected in the infusion. Transfer of ENNs and BEA was low and did not exceed 7%. Infusion pH affected MPA transfer rate; it increased from 23% to 96% in the pH range from 5.5 to 6.3. 83% of OTA was detected in the infusion of a single contaminated sample. Consideration of the mycotoxin transfer rate to herbal tea infusions resulted in the change of the model herbal tea input into mean chronic dietary exposure for most studied mycotoxins.										2021	14	4	539	551	1875-0710				10.3920/WMJ2020.2606					FSTA:2022-11-Hn10241

Food Chemistry					Plant proteins are biopolymers with interesting technological applications for the food industry due to their ability to interact with phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins. The 3D structure of the 7S globulin from grape seed was elucidated for the first time using a homology model. The constructed 3D model showed that grape seed 7S globulin is rich in alpha-helices and beta-sheets stabilized by six disulfide bridges. The interaction with the major grape anthocyanin malvidin-3-glucoside was also assessed by Docking and Molecular Dynamic simulation. Theoretical results demonstrated that 7S globulin interacts with Mv3glc through hydrogen, alkyl and pi-alkyl bonds and the flavylium cation is oriented towards a hydrophobic region of the protein, being protected from hydration. Results provide valuable insights for understanding the mechanisms involved in the molecular interaction of grape anthocyanins with grape seed proteins that could be relevant to use them as potential color protecting agents in food industry applications.

Food Chemistry					The effect of spray drying on the different polyphenolic compounds present in the root of a purple-fleshed sweet potato variety of Ipomoea batatas native from Peru was performed by HPLC-QTOF-MSMS. Nine anthocyanins, including four peonidin, three cyanidin and two pelargonidin derivatives glycosylated with sophorose and/or glucose and acylated with caffeic, ferulic and p-hydroxybenzoic acid were identified. Twenty nine cinnamoylquinic acids (CiQA), including eight mono-CiQA, fourteen di-CiQA, and five tri-CiQA, were identified on the base of their MS fragmentation profile. Relevant amounts of feruloylquinic acid derivatives were identified. Among them, some di and tri-CiQAs containing feruloyl and caffeoyl moieties in their structures, and di-feruloylquinic acids were reported here, for the first time, in Ipomoea. Spray drying process negatively affected the different phenolic groups, with polyphenol losses representing around 90% of the initial amounts. Mono-CiQAs presenting feruloyl moieties and mono acylated peonidin derivatives with p-hydroxybenzoic acid were the less affected compounds.

Food Chemistry					The inhibitory effect of three polysaccharides (alginate, pectin and chitosan) on acrylamide formation was investigated in chemical and fried potato food model systems, under two heating regimes (heating block and microwave). In the chemical system, acrylamide formation followed a second order reaction kinetic behaviour. Activation energies (Ea) were 17.85 and 110.78 kJ/mol for conventional and microwave heating respectively. Acrylamide content was highest at 180 °C after 60 min conventional heating (27.88 ng/ml) and 3.5 fold higher after microwave heating for 60 s (800 W, 98.02 ng/ml). Alginate (0.3% w/v) and pectin (0.2% w/v) solutions efficiently inhibited acrylamide formation by 65% and 56% respectively under conventional heating, and 36% and 30% respectively under microwave heating. Coating potatoes with alginate, pectin and chitosan (1% w/v) prior to frying dramatically inhibited acrylamide formation by 54%, 51% and 41% respectively. However only alginate and pectin slightly reduced acrylamide by 5% in the microwave. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Bioscience					A novel sustained-release bio-preservative based on beta-cyclodextrin encapsulated eugenol (EU) was prepared through 10 MeV electron beam irradiation. Response surface methodology coupled with a Box-Behnken design (RSM-BBD) was used to optimize irradiation dose, stirring temperature and stirring time to obtain inclusion complex of EU/beta-cyclodextrin-g-acrylamide (EU/beta-CD-g-AM) with high EU encapsulation efficiency (EE). The structure of the EU/beta-CD-g-AM was confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Optimization treatments were found for irradiation dose of 8 kGy, stirring temperature of 60 °C and time of 2.4 h. The obtained EU/beta-CD-g-AM inclusion complex showed the maximum EE of 50.95%. The encapsulation enhances the stability and solubility of EU. The EU could be sustained-released into media and the release peak at pH 7 (73%) and pH 8 (77%) were both occurred after 24 h, while at pH 5 was reached after 12 h. Total viable counts (TVC) of weevers (Micropterus salmoides) processed by EU/beta-CD-g-AM was 6.75 log10 cfu/g on the 15th day of the storage, prolonging the shelf life of weevers for 6 days after sustained EU release, compared with the control, whose TVC was 7.35 log10 cfu/g on 9th day. Overall, it can be seen that EU/beta-CD-g-AM inclusion is a promising sustained-release bio-preservative to maintain food quality.

The mature fruit of Lycium chinense Miller attenuates cisplatin-induced renal damage in mice via regulation of oxidant and antioxidant enzymes.		Journal of Functional Foods					The present study was conducted to examine whether Lycii Fructus, the mature fruit of Lycium chinense Miller (Solanaceae), is a functional food and has an ameliorative effect on a mouse model of cisplatin-induced acute renal failure. Cisplatin (20 mg/kg B.W.) was administered by I.P. injection to mice that had received oral Lycii Fructus extract (10 or 30 mg/kg B.W. per day) for the preceding 2 days. Cisplatin-treated control mice showed body weight loss and increased kidney weight, whereas Lycii Fructus extract administration attenuated these effects. Moreover, Lycii Fructus extract significantly decreased serum creatinine, a renal functional parameter. Lycii Fructus extract also significantly reduced oxidative stress- and inflammation-related biomarker levels and protein expressions in the kidney. Lycii Fructus extract treatment led to significantly attenuated histological damage in the kidney. These results suggest that therapy with Lycii Fructus extract has beneficial effects on renal injury induced by cisplatin in this experimental model.

J		Chan Lik Hao; Mohd Esah, E.; Azan Tajarudin, H.; Beauty Akter; Mohd Salleh, R.							Effect of potential prebiotics from selected fruits peel on the growth of probiotics.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aims to evaluate the potential prebiotic compounds of yellow watermelon, honeydew, and papaya peels by studying their effects on probiotics namely Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Comparing three peel higher growth for L. rhamnosus and B. bifidum bacteria found from watermelon and honeydew which are 9.90 and 9.82 (log CFU/g dry extract) after 48 hr. Yellow watermelon peel extract also showed significantly higher amounts of indigestible polysaccharides (104.50 mg/g) than the other two peels. Glucose and fructose were the major reducing sugar present with a total of 340.34,465.25, and 212.25 mg/g of dry peel extracts from yellow watermelon, honeydew and papaya respectively. Honeydew and yellow watermelon peel extract showed the highest hydrolysis of 13.80% and 13.68% and 11.27% and 10.53% to artificial human gastric juice and alpha-amylase digestion, respectively. The results indicated that among three fruit peels yellow watermelon peel shows high prebiotic potentiality. Practical applications. This study found fruit peels contain a reasonably high amount of potential prebiotic compounds. The polysaccharide extracts of the peel showed a significant effect in stimulating the growth of L. rhamnosus and B. bifidum compared with the controlled study within 48 hr, where polysaccharide extract of yellow watermelon peel proving the most effective because it was able to significantly increase the probiotic bacteria count within 24 hr. In brief, yellow watermelon peel possessed the best prebiotic potential due to its high yield, quick effect in stimulating the growth of probiotic bacteria, high amount of reducing sugar, and indigestible non-starch polysaccharide while also resist digestion by gastric juice and alpha-amylase. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15581					FSTA:2021-10-Jg13818

Determination of ethanol content in kombucha using headspace gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection: single-laboratory validation.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Kombucha is a fermented beverage made with tea, sugar, and a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast that is usually marketed as a non-alcoholic beverage. Products must contain <0.5% and <1.1% alcohol by volume in the United States and Canada respectively to be classified as non-alcoholic products. Prior studies have found that Kombucha beverages can become very acidic and may contain levels of alcohol above 1% which can be a potential health risk to children and the developing fetus during pregnancy. Objective. Given the public safety concerns and legal requirements associated with the level of alcohol within Kombucha beverages, there is a need for accurate and reliable methods. Herein we describe the validation of a sensitive, rapid, and simple Headspace Gas Chromatographic method with mass spectrometric detection for determining ethanol in Kombucha. Methods. Method performance characteristics measured included linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) as per AOAC International guideline Appendix K Part 1. Performance was evaluated against the AOAC Standard Method Performance Requirements 2016.001 for determination of ethanol in Kombucha. Results. The linear dynamic range for this method was confirmed over the range of 0.025 to 2.47% ABV. The LOD and LOQ were determined to be 0.0002% and 0.002% ABV, respectively. With a spike recovery of 102% for accuracy and precision of RSDr ≤ 4% the method met the SMPR requirements within the analytical range. Conclusions. The results of this validation study demonstrated the method is fit for the purpose of quantifying ethanol in Kombucha and is suitable for rapid and easy integration by laboratories to ensure that regulatory requirements are met. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

Antibacterial activity of black cumin, clove, and ginger essential oils against specific spoilage organisms of ready-to-eat chilli shrimp paste.		International Food Research Journal					Ready-to-eat (RTE) chilli shrimp paste has a short shelf life; thus, chemical additives are usually added to extend it. However, certain additives have potential health implications. In this regard, plant essential oils (EOs) which exhibit antibacterial properties can be used as an alternative for extending the shelf life of RTE chilli shrimp paste. The present work intended to (1) establish the microbial profile of RTE chilli shrimp paste, (2) determine the antibacterial activities of black cumin, clove, and ginger EOs against the isolated specific spoilage organisms (SSO) of RTE chilli shrimp paste, and (3) determine their effect on the shelf life of RTE chilli shrimp paste. Biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing were used to identify the SSO in RTE chilli shrimp paste. Disc diffusion assay was performed for antibacterial analysis of EOs. To monitor the shelf life of the paste, total plate count (TPC) and yeast and mould count (YMC) were carried out for five days. The results showed that the SSO of RTE chilli shrimp paste were dominated by Staphylococcus spp. followed by Klebsiella aerogenes and Enterobacter tabaci. EOs of black cumin, clove, and ginger showed inhibitory effects against the SSO with the highest inhibition by ginger EO of 27.50 9.19 to 58.00 7.21 mm. Application of ginger EO in RTE chilli shrimp paste showed a 3-log reduction of bacterial population and 4-log reduction for fungal population. It was concluded that ginger EO can be a highly potential candidate to be added into RTE chilli shrimp paste as a natural additive to extend its shelf life.										2021	28	2	393	400	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-10-Re3496

Evaluation of physical and instrumentally determined sensory attributes of Atlantic salmon portions packaged in modified atmosphere and vacuum skin.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Fresh Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) were slaughtered and stored on ice at 0 °C then portioned and packaged six to eight days later in modified atmosphere (CO2: N2 60:40) packaging (MAP), vacuum skin packaging and open air. All fillet portions were stored in refrigerated conditions at 4 °C. Physical and instrumentally determined sensory quality parameters, including water holding properties, pH, colour, texture and microbiological shelf life, were examined for three weeks. The results showed that both MAP and vacuum skin packaging gave comparable quality in drip loss, water holding capacity, texture and microbiological shelf life. Both packaging groups displayed increased lightness and decreased redness and yellowness throughout storage after filleting. Fillets kept in MAP had consistently lower pH with a darker, more reddish, and yellowish colour than skin packaged fillets. Fillets stored in air had the shortest microbiological shelf life (<13 days) even when they were portioned later. It is concluded that the microbiological shelf life of MAP and skin packaged fillets at 4 °C was around 18-20 days with a limit of 106 cfu/g and therefore effectively extends the microbiological shelf life of raw fillets by 1.5 times.

J		Chan Won Seo; Byoungseung Yoo							Preparation of milk protein isolate/kappa-carrageenan conjugates by maillard reaction in wet-heating system and their application to stabilization of oil-in-water emulsions.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, milk protein isolate (MPI) was conjugated with kappa-carrageenan (CG) via the Maillard reaction in a wet-heating system at 65 °C for 48 h. As the Maillard reaction progressed, the browning intensity increased. The structural changes and formation of MPI-CG conjugates were confirmed through various analyses that proved their effective preparation via the Maillard reaction under the wet-heating system. Furthermore, we also investigated the rheological properties, fat droplet size distributions, and physical stability of emulsions stabilized by the MPI-CG mixture (0 h) immediately after mixing without heat treatment and MPI-CG conjugates with different reaction times. All emulsions exhibited shear-thinning behavior with lower flow behavior index values than 1 (n=0.41-0.63), and their apparent viscosity (etaa, 10) and consistency index (K) decreased with increasing reaction time. The MPI-CG conjugates produced larger fat droplets than the MPI-CG mixture (0 h), and the fat droplet size of the emulsions stabilized by the MPI-CG conjugates increased with increasing reaction time. Even so, the stability of the emulsions stabilized by the MPI-CG conjugates was improved when compared to the emulsion stabilized by the MPI-CG mixture (0 h), and the MPI-CG conjugate after a 12 h reaction time produced the most stable oil-in-water emulsion.

J		Chan Zhong; Peng-Fei Hou; Ya-Xing Li; Wen-Yu Yang; Mei Shu; Guo-Ping Wu							Characterization, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of gelatin film incorporated with protocatechuic acid and its application on beef preservation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A novel active packaging gelatin film incorporated with protocatechuic acid (PCA) was prepared and characterized. After addition of PCA from 0.1 to 1.0%, gelatin films showed the improved extensibility and barrier properties with better elongation at break, lower water vapor permeability and UV light transmission compared with control group. Meanwhile, the higher thickness and total color difference, weaker tensile strength of these films were also found in gelatin-PCA composite films. The molecular interaction of these films between PCA and gelatin were non-covalent linkages, including hydrogen bond, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction, contributing to homogenous and smooth microstructures observed in SEM morphologies of gelatin films containing PCA of 0.1-1.0%. In addition, gelatin-PCA composite films presented the obvious antioxidant capability to scavenge DPPH radicals and the significant inhibitory effect on total viable counts of beef in chilled storage condition. Furthermore, they also exhibited strong antibacterial effects against E. coli O157:H7 and S. aureus both in vitro as well as the challenge of beef preservation in 4 °C simulation tests. These results suggested that fish gelatin-PCA composite film, as a novel active packaging film with good functional property and high biological activity, has promising application on foods preservation.

Determination of total phenolic contents and antioxidant activities of fruits from wild and creole Carica papaya genotypes in comparison to commercial papaya cultivars.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Antioxidant activity (AA), total polyphenols content (TPC) and polyphenols profile (PP) were investigated during 10 days of postharvest ripening, in peels and pulps from fruits from three Carica papaya genotypes of different origin. Wild-genotype (WG) collected in Yucatan, Mexico (part of its center of origin) showed higher AA and TPC values than the commercial-genotype (CG). Likewise, PP analysis resulted in the identification and quantification of 4 families: phenolic acids, flavanols, dihydrochalcones and flavonols in both peels and pulps, as well as lignans, that were only found in fruit peels. Interestingly, fruits from WG also had higher contents than CG, in the following specific polyphenols: in peels; 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid (chlorogenic acid) and kaempferol (both absent in CG), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid 4-O-glucoside (3.8 times), quercetin 3-O-hexoside (3.5 times), 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (2.8 times), 5-O-galloylquinic acid (2.7 times) and matairesinol (2.6 times). In pulps; 4-O-caffeoylquinic acid (9.4 times), quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin; 6.8 times), p-coumaric acid 4-O-glucoside (p-coumaroyl hexoside; 2.5 times), p-coumaroyl glycolic acid (2.5 times) and phloridzin (1.7 times). The superior capacity of wild native genotypes to accumulate more total polyphenols, to show higher antioxidant activity and to show even higher contents of some specific polyphenols known to have beneficial health effects (against chronic degenerative diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular diseases), might represent a good base for breeding programs aiming to obtain new varieties with superior nutraceutical properties. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Preparation and characterization of chitosan-based bioactive films incorporating Moringa oleifera leaves extract.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The addition of bioactive components, especially antioxidants, and plasticizers are good strategies to improve the properties of edible films. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of adding Moringa oleifera ethanolic extract (MEE) and glycerol (G) in chitosan (C) films. Two concentrations of MEE (0.07 and 0.15% wt) and two concentrations of G (20 and 40% wt) were incorporated and their effect on the physical, mechanical, optical, barrier, structural, morphological, and bioactive properties of the film was evaluated. In physical properties, the incorporation of G increased the density and moisture in 78.2% and 71.3%, respectively. However, the addition of MEE affected the solubility. Films with 40% wt of G and MEE exhibited an antiplasticizing effect, which was observed in a decrease of 38.3% in tensile strength (TS) and 72.1% in percentage of elongation at break (% Eb) values. In the optical properties, the addition of MEE acted as a barrier to light transmission. The water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of some films showed a decreased up to 6.5% due to the presence of MEE compared to control films. In structural properties, infrared spectroscopy revealed that the structure of the films was slightly modified. Scanning electron micrographs showed that the films were homogeneous and films with 40% wt G showed two phases on their surface. Films with 40% wt G and 0.15% wt MEE presented the highest content of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity. This formulation showed suitable physicochemical properties and could be considered as a potential material for active packaging for food products. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Chan-Won Seo; Byoungseung Yoo							Effect of kappa-carrageenan/milk protein interaction on rheology and microstructure in dairy emulsion systems with different milk protein types and kappa-carrageenan concentrations.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					We investigated the effect of kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CG) addition and supplementation with Na-CN, WPI, and MPI on the rheological properties, microstructure, fat globule size distribution, and stability of low-fat cream (LFC) emulsions containing 19% milk fat. Rheological parameter (etaa, 10, K, and G′) values of LFCs increased with kappa-CG addition. At 0.1% kappa-CG concentration, MPI-stabilized LFC had higher G′ value (64.8 Pa) than those of WPI-stabilized LFC (51.3 Pa) and Na-CN-stabilized LFC (34.8 Pa), indicating the strong interaction between MPI and kappa-CG. Cryo-SEM images showed the protein layers on milk fat globule membrane in dairy emulsions and revealed that kappa-CG led to depletion-flocculation of milk fat globules and promoted clustering of globules. The creaming index values of LFCs with 0.10% kappa-CG were lower than those of LFCs with 0.05% kappa-CG. Thus, high kappa-CG concentrations can contribute to the physical stability in dairy emulsions stabilized by milk proteins. Practical applications. Milk proteins are widely used as emulsifiers, and kappa-carrageenan (kappa-CG) is added to dairy emulsion products to improve their physical properties and stability. Therefore, in this study, the effect of kappa-CG addition on physical properties and stability of low-fat creams (LFCs) supplemented with different milk protein types (Na-CN, WPI, and MPI) was investigated. The strong synergistic interaction between proteins and kappa-CG was observed in MPI-stabilized LFCs when compared to Na-CN-and WPI-stabilized LFCs. We found that the presence of kappa-CG in MPI-stabilized LFCs improved the stability of LFCs by inhibiting the phase separation due to the high viscosity of the continuous phase. These findings suggest that dairy cream-based food products with desirable physical properties can be realized through kappa-CG addition to LFC emulsions with milk proteins such as ice cream mix, coffee creamer, and light cream. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15038					FSTA:2021-05-Pn2786

Food Bioscience					The current study was investigated the effect of catechin rich green tea extracts (GTE) formulated with excipient components, crude tea polysaccharides (CTP), and flavonols (FVN) derived from green tea on sucrose hydrolysis and intestinal transport of monosaccharides using an in vitro digestion system with Caco-2 cell. Sucrose (10 mg) co-digested with GTE (1 mg) + FVN (0.01 mg) or GTE (1 mg) + CTP (0.1 mg) + FVN (0.01 mg) was less hydrolyzed into glucose and fructose, which showed 90.4 1.36% and 91.75 1.48% for the control (sucrose), respectively. Approximately 65.59% of the glucose released from the sucrose digested with GTE (1 mg) + CTP (0.1 mg) + FVN (0.01 mg) was subsequently transported by Caco-2 cell, which was significantly lower than other treatments (p < 0.05). The intestinal transport of fructose was inhibited by the co-digestion with GTE (1 mg) + FVN (0.01 mg) (43.65% of control) and GTE (1 mg) + CTP (0.1 mg) + FVN (0.01 mg) (43.12% of control). When glucose or fructose was directly treated to Caco-2 cell, glucose transport was inhibited in GTE (60.7% of control), while fructose transport was repressed in GTE + CTP + FVN (54.75% of control). Epithelial permeability (%) of the glucose and fructose ranged from 14.77 to 24.33% and 1.5-2.24%, respectively. Results. Suggest that co-intake catechin rich extract of catechin rich extract with polysaccharides and flavonols derived from green tea processing could be potential hypoglycemic ingredients when added sugars are consumed.

Eight different bioactivity profiles of 40 cinnamons by multi-imaging planar chromatography hyphenated with effect-directed assays and high-resolution mass spectrometry.		Food Chemistry					Spices contain plenty of bioactive compounds, used to valorize foods. However, product quality may be affected by contaminations and adulterations along the global production chain. A newly developed multi-imaging in combination with bioactivity screening directly pointed to individual multi-potent compounds. For cinnamon as prominent example, the multi-imaging results provided a wealth of new information on their effects and clearly visualized the valorizing potential of cinnamon to foods. The separation focus was in the mid-polar to apolar range. Eight effect-directed assays (EDA, i.e. one radical scavenging, two biological and five biochemical assays) were performed in situ the high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) adsorbent. Several multi-potent compound zones were revealed and further characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), highlighting the bioactive potential of cinnamaldehyde, cinnamic acid, benzoic acid, coumarin, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, palmitic acid, caproic acid, and linalool oxide. This HPTLC-UV/Vis/FLD-EDA-HRMS profiling provided comprehensive information on product quality and safety.

Food Control					This study investigates the interaction of fish oil-protein and phenolic-rich green tea extract on the physico-chemical quality, lipid oxidation and bacteriostatic properties of different treatments of surimi gel incorporated with fish oil (FO) and Pseuderanthemum palatiferum freeze-dried powder (PFP). The incorporation of 3-6% FO, and 100-200 mg PFP/100 g surimi were investigated. The effect of PFP on the FO-fortified surimi gel had a positive effect on the textural and bio-potential properties. FO-PFP samples showed a higher water-holding capacity than the control gel. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) analysis of the surimi gel confirmed the successful blending of oil-protein and phenolic compounds present in PFP. The antioxidant activity and oxidative stability of PUFA-enriched oil increased with the addition of FO-PFP; moreover, the addition of PFP showed good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes. Hence, the combination of small amounts of PFP in oil-emulsified surimi gel could help in obtaining good-quality surimi gel fortified with health-beneficial polyunsaturated fatty acids that have antibacterial properties.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					Eco-friendly methods for extraction of phycocyanins (C-PC and A-PC) from dry biomass of Spirulina platensis were carried out employing nanoparticles (NP), polyethylene glycol (PEG) and salts. There are practically no reports on such methods of extraction of phycocyanins from S. platensis. Standardization of process parameters such as concentration of NP/salt/PEG, extraction time, temperature and solvent was carried out for all the methods employed to achieve maximum productivity (yield and purity). The standardized conditions for NP, salt and PEG based extractions were observed to be 10 mug/mL, 3 mg/mL and 10% w/w concentration, respectively, phosphate buffer as an extraction solvent, 160 min of extraction time and 35 °C of extraction temperature. Silver nanoparticles based extraction resulted in the highest yield (47.68 and 34.18 mg/g db) and purity (0.98 and 0.33) of C-PC and A-PC, respectively. These results are among the highest reported in the primary extraction (itself) without any additional field intervention or process aids.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to develop a simultaneous drying and disinfection method for off-ground harvested almonds to improve drying efficiency and product safety. Almonds were dried in a column dryer (0.57 m-height) with hot air under constant temperature (ambient, 40, 50 and 60 °C) or step-down temperature (preheating with 80 °C and 90 °C, holding for 1-3 h, then stepping down to complete drying at 60 °C) and 1.0 m/s velocity. The drying time ranged from 240 to 2160 min to dry almonds from initial moisture content of 0.41 kg water/kg wet mass to a targeted 0.12 kg water/kg wet mass. Specific energy consumption ranged from 14.3 to 22.0 MJ/kg. No cavity, significant color change, concealed damage or oil quality deterioration were observed under all tested conditions. Step-down temperature drying with holding achieved up to 0.8 log CFU/g total bacterial counts reduction of in-shell almonds. Drying in-shell almonds saved up to 75% drying time and 78.6% specific energy consumption compared to drying in-hull almonds under the same temperature, with more uniform final moisture distribution. The findings suggested off-ground harvested almonds should be sorted and de-hulled prior to drying, which could significantly improve the drying efficiency, moisture uniformity and throughput of the drying process.

The drying time ranged from 2.5 to 6 h. No cavity, no color change, no significant concealed damage and no deterioration of oil quality were observed under the tested conditions (p < 0.05). Page model was used to standardize the initial and final moistures of almonds for energy consumption calculation. The specific energy consumption of the drying process ranged from 7.01 to 19.05 MJ/kg under the tested conditions. The energies consumed for drying different almond components were calculated based on the moisture removal from each components during the drying of the mixture of in-hull almonds, in-shell almonds, kernels and loose hulls, which showed more than 60% of energy was consumed for drying the hulls, and only 20% was used for kernel drying. Therefore, freshly harvested almonds should be sorted based on their moisture levels and dried separately. The findings from this study provide an important guidance for drying off-ground harvested almonds with improved efficiency and ensured product quality.

J		Chang Geun Lee; Youn Young Shim; Reaney, M. J. T.; Hye-Ja Chang							Food puree for seniors: the effects of XanFlax as a new thickener on physicochemical and antioxidant properties.		Foods					With the increasing number of older adults, the elderly-friendly food market has been rapidly growing. The physicochemical and antioxidant properties of soymilk-based banana-blueberry-puree with and without flaxseed-based (XanFlax) and xanthan-gum-based (brand G) thickeners were compared as a potential senior food. Samples included a control, three treatments with XanFlax (1%, 3%, and 5%), and three treatments with brand G (1.35%, 2.7%, and 5.4%). The physicochemical (color, sugar, salinity, pH, viscosity, and hardness) and antioxidant properties [DPPH, ABTS, reducing power (RP), and total polyphenol content (TPC)] were compared. The chromaticity values (L*, a*, and b*) and pHs were similar among all treatments and the control, but the salinity of brand G showed statistical differences (p< 0.05). All samples met the Korean Industrial Standards for senior foods in terms of viscosity and hardness, while samples with brand G were harder and more viscous than those with XanFlax and the control (p< 0.001). XanFlax samples had greater ABTS radical scavenging activities than the control and brand G samples (p< 0.001). Although, the developed puree can be a possible senior food product without the addition of thickeners, XanFlax might be applied as a non-xanthan gum-based viscosity thickener with antioxidant functions for senior-friendly foods. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chang Ha Park; Ye Eun Park; Hyeon Ji Yeo; Jeong Su Yoon; Soo-Yun Park; Jae Kwang Kim; Sang Un Park							Comparative analysis of secondary metabolites and metabolic profiling between diploid and tetraploid Morus alba L.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					We profiled and quantified primary (amine, organic acids, tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, amino acids, and carbohydrates) and secondary metabolites (triterpenoids, phenolic acids, carotenoids, flavonoids, and anthocyanins) in the edible parts (leaves and fruits) of the diploid and tetraploid cultivar Morus alba L. "Cheongil." Through comprehensive metabolic profiling, the tetraploid mulberry cultivar was able to produce diverse metabolites supported by higher accumulation patterns of primary and secondary metabolites in their edible parts. In particular, the edible parts of the tetraploid showed higher accumulation patterns of most metabolites (amino acids, carbohydrates, carotenoids, and anthocyanins) than the diploid, which was supported by the results of principal component analyses (PCAs) showing a clear separation between the diploid and tetraploid groups. Additionally, this metabolome study comprehensively described the correlation between primary and secondary metabolites in the edible parts of diploid and tetraploid mulberry cultivars and provided information useful for plant breeding strategies to improve metabolite biosynthesis using polyploidy.										2021	69	4	1300	1307	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06863					FSTA:2021-06-Jf7209
J		Chang He; Min Zhang; Sakamon Devahastin							Microwave-induced deformation behaviors of 4D printed starch-based food products as affected by edible salt and butter content.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Due to increased interest in directional deformation of 3D printed products, any novel means to induce such a deformation is of interest. Here, microwave dehydration as external stimulus was applied to prepare 4D printed starch-based food products with directional bending deformation. First, the effects of solid content of purple sweet potato paste (PSPP) and mashed potato (MP) were investigated; such the solid content positively correlated with the apparent viscosity, G' and yield stress, but negatively correlated with T2 relaxation time of the pastes. The solid content of 30% was identified as the most appropriate for subsequent directional deformation experiments. The effects of edible salt and butter content on dielectric properties and bending angles of the printed products were determined. Increased edible salt and butter content significantly reduced the bending angles of PSPP and MP. In addition, the bending angles of MP were higher than those of PSPP at the same conditions. Industrial relevance This study provides ideas for controlled deformation of 3D printed objects; microwave dehydration was selected as a stimulus that can be conducted even in a small industry or at a household level. These procedures would allow the creation of foods with attractive appearances for consumption at either a restaurant or at home. The proposed technique should also lay a foundation for further application of 4D food printing.

J		Chang Liu; Linyan Yang; Wei Zhang; Daowen Li; Liuan Li; Hongyu Wang; Yi Ma; Cun Li							A magnetic nanoparticle-based lateral flow immunochromatography assay for the rapid detection of fluoroquinolones in milk.		European Food Research and Technology					A magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-based lateral flow immunochromatography assay (LFIA) was established to detect fluoroquinolones (FQs) in milk. This method is an improvement of traditional Au nanoparticle (AuNP)-based LFIA. Compared with AuNP-labeled antibody, the combination between MNPs and antibody is stronger and more stable, and the preparation process is convenient. In this study, the color intensity of MNPs-LFIA test strip was analyzed, which laid a research foundation for magnetic quantitative analysis and high sensitivity analysis of LFIA. The limits of detection (LODs) for 10 FQs in phosphate buffer (PB) solution ranged from 1 to 5 ng/mL, and in milk ranged from 2 to 20 ng/mL. The recovery in spiked milk sample ranged from 16.47 to 83.67%. The log functions of analyte concentration and T/C value were fitted into a linear equation. The specificity of the MNPs-LFIA is satisfactory, without cross-reaction with antibiotics from other chemical classes. The results of this method are consistent with those of ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, indicating the MNPs-LFIA method is reliable and accurate. As far as we know, this is the first time that MNPs-LIFA has been applied to the detection of FQs in milk. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	10	2645	2656	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03820-z					FSTA:2022-01-Pe0236
J		Chang Liu; Yichuan Cao; Tian Zhao; Xiaohui Wang; Guozhen Fang; Shuo Wang							A novel multi-purpose MIP for SPE-HPLC and QCM detection of carbaryl residues in foods.		Food Analytical Methods					In this work, two detection methods of solid-phase extraction-high-performance liquid chromatography (SPE-HPLC) and quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) were established, based on a surface molecularly imprinted polymer material (MIP). The material can be used as a selective solid-phase extraction filler and as a coating for sensitive quartz crystal microbalances by virtue of the polyhydroxy structure of grafted silicon spheres together with the network structure from cross-linked polymerization. The adsorption properties of the prepared MIP were analysed by dynamic and static adsorption tests, and the experimental conditions for SPE-HPLC and QCM analysis were optimized. Under the optimal conditions, the linear range of MIP-SPE-HPLC for the detection of carbaryl was 0.5-60 mug L-1 (R2=0.99913), and the detection limit was 0.0573 mug L-1. The proposed QCM sensor displayed a linear relationship between the frequency shift and the concentration of carbaryl ranging from 5 to 80 mug L-1 with a low detection limit of 0.6845 mug L-1 (signal-to-noise ratio, S/ N=3). Through a series of experiments, it was shown that the prepared MIP has good adsorption and selectivity for carbaryl, and the MIP-based HPLC and QCM sensor can be applied to the detection of actual food samples. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	14	2	331	343	1936-9751				10.1007/s12161-020-01875-4					FSTA:2021-06-Cf1817
J		Chang Liu; Yanli Jia; Yan Qiu							Ethyl acetate fraction of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) medic flowers exerts inhibitory effects against oxidative stress in H2O2-induced HepG2 cells and D-galactose-induced aging mice.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Oxidative stress has been demonstrated to be associated with numerous aging-related diseases. Ethyl acetate fraction of Abelmoschus manihot (L.) Medic (EA) had been reported to possess strong radical-scavenging activity due to its rich content of flavonoids. This work aimed to determine the protective effects of EA against oxidative injuries in vivo and in vitro, as well as to explore the relevant mechanisms behind these effects. Pretreatment with EA significantly elevated cell viability of H2O2-induced HepG2 cells, reduced the reactive oxygen species level, decreased apoptotic cells, and inhibited activities of caspase 3/9. Meanwhile, EA pretreatment elevated the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) generation and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release dose-dependently. In addition, EA modulated key marker genes expression of antioxidation and apoptosis-related signaling pathways at the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. In the animal studies, EA also significantly enhanced the antioxidant activity and reduced MDA generation in serum, liver, and brain of the D-galactose (D-gal)-induced mice. Furthermore, the histological analysis indicated that EA effectively alleviated liver and brain injury of mice induced by D-gal, dose-dependently. EA as a potential antioxidant agent promoted health and reduced the risk of aging-associated diseases.										2021	24	9	997	1009	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0053					FSTA:2022-03-Jq3398

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Waxy maize (Zea mays L. sinensis Kulesh) is a good material for brewing. Waxy maize wine, a kind of Chinese rice wine, is strongly affected by a fermentation starter named Qu. In this study, an innovative mixed Qu, consisting of two yeasts and three molds, was produced and the raw-starch brewing method was applied in winemaking. Three other waxy maize wines fermented by three kinds of commercial Qu were also analyzed for comparison. Results. Due to superb growth and fermentation characteristics, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CICC1009 and Pichia anomala CICC1851 were chosen to produce yeast Qu. The addition amount of yeast Qu was determined to be 30 gkg-1. In terms of chemical properties, mixed Qu was more suitable for making maize wine by the raw-starch brewing method than the three kinds of commercial Qu with which it was compared. The most influential components for the overall aroma profile in maize wines fermented by mixed Qu and Mifeng Qu were ethyl butyrate and beta-damascenone, respectively, while in maize wines fermented by Angel Qu and Like Qu the most influential component was ethyl octanoate. Obvious differences were found among four maize wines regarding bitterness, umami, richness, saltiness, and sourness by the electronic tongue. The olfactory characteristics of maize wine fermented by Mifeng Qu were quite different from the other three according to the electronic nose. Conclusion. The innovative mixed Qu can be considered as an excellent starter for raw-starch brewing of waxy maize. The chemical indices and volatile flavor compounds of waxy maize wines were greatly affected by different kinds of Qu. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2328	2336	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10854					FSTA:2021-07-Hc6902

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Epsilon-Poly-L-lysine (epsilon-PL) is a natural antimicrobial poly-cationic peptide widely applied as a natural preservative in the food industry, whereas its application in preventing postharvest loss of fruit was largely absent. This study investigated the antifungal activity of epsilon-PL and determined the possible mechanisms involved. The in vivo results indicated that 500 mg L-1 exogenous epsilon-PL treatment significantly inhibited black spot rot in apple, jujube, and tomato. The lesion diameter inhibition rate was range from 20.11% to 29.09% by 500 mg L-1 epsilon-PL treatment. epsilon-PL exerts antifungal activity against A. alternata in vitro, the half-inhibition concentration is 160.1 mg L-1. epsilon-PL induced morphology and ultrastructure change on the pathogen, which resulted in the inhibition of A. alternata. This was accomplished by disturbing pathogen membrane integrity and functionality. The fluorometric assay confirmed that epsilon-PL induced endogenous reactive oxygen species formation and accumulation in A. alternata and the elicited severe lipid peroxidation that caused membrane lesions. Further, epsilon-PL treatment enhanced the expression of genes involved in antioxidant metabolism and pathogenesis-related responses in apple fruit. These findings illustrated that epsilon-PL exhibits multifaceted antifungal activity by the direct effect on the pathogen as well as induce host defense responses. epsilon-PL may be conducive as a promising alternative for Alternaria rot management.

Food Chemistry					In this study, the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HP) treatment on the binding capacity, interaction, and antioxidant activity of the binding products of blueberry pectin (BP) and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were assessed. HP was found to significantly improve the adsorption between C3G and BP. After binding, the C3G concentration was found to be the highest (382.1 13.2 mug/mg for BP) when using a C3G-BP mass ratio of 1:2, a pressure of 400 MPa, and a holding time of 15 min. HP processing decreased particle size and altered the characteristics of C3G-BP complexes. The main binding form of the complexes before HP treatment was pectin-wrapped C3G by hydrogen bond interaction, while HP caused charged groups in pectin to be more exposed and improve the electrostatic interaction between C3G and BP. The antioxidant activity results showed that the presence of BP could protect the ferric-reducing antioxidant power of C3G after HP treatment.

Journal of Functional Foods					To investigate whether complexes of cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) and blueberry pectin (BP) can exert protective effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced Caco-2 inflammatory cells, as well as the influence of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing on the activities of the complexes, for determining their anti-apoptosis in vitro. LPS-induced Caco-2 cells were treated with C3G-BP complexes with or without HHP treatment. Results showed that C3G-BP complexes (100-100 g/mL) inhibited the depolarization of mitochondria and reduced the production of ROS, as demonstrated by the reduced mRNA expression of IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-8; increased expression of IL-10; and reduced iNOS, COX-2, Bcl-2, and cleaved caspase-3 levels. These findings reveal that C3G-BP exerts anti-apoptosis effects by inhibiting several mediators and cytokines involved in the inflammatory process. Furthermore, HHP-treated C3G-BP complexes better reduced cell apoptosis than untreated complexes, owing to the high pressure-mediated alterations in the monosaccharide composition of the complexes. This study provides insights for the functional changes of anthocynin-pectin complexes during food processing applications.

Quality characteristics of yogurts fermented with short-chain fatty acid-producing probiotics and their effects on mucin production and probiotic adhesion onto human colon epithelial cells.		Journal of Dairy Science					Probiotics can ferment nondigestible carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA; acetate, propionate, and butyrate) in the human colon. In this study, the levels of SCFA were determined in the following yogurts fermented with different combinations of probiotics: (1) cocultures of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus (control, C); (2) S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum (C-Bb); (3) S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus acidophilus (C-La); and (4) S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, and Lactobacillus gasseri (C-Lg). Results showed that the acetate levels were significantly higher in C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurts than in C yogurt. Fermentation and physicochemical characteristics of all yogurts were identical. Treatment of mucus-secreting colon epithelial cells (HT29-MTX) with C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurt supernatants resulted in an increase in the expression of MUC2 and CDX2 and the production of mucin proteins. The adhesion of probiotics onto HT29-MTX cells increased following treatment with C-Bb, C-La, and C-Lg yogurt supernatants. Our data suggest that a yogurt diet rich in acetate improves the protective function of the intestinal epithelium. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Chang-Cheng Zhao; Jong-Bang Eun							Characterization of volatile compounds and physicochemical properties of hongeo using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry during fermentation.		Food Bioscience					Changes in the volatile composition and some chemical properties of fermented skate, hongeo at different stages in its fermentation process were investigated using headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The result showed that a significant increase in pH, ammonia nitrogen, total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN) and trimethylamine nitrogen (TMAN) content during fermentation. A total of 208 volatile compounds, consisting mainly of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, esters, amines, aldehydes, sulfur compounds, indoles, phenols, and other compounds, were detected and identified. Volatile compounds including amines, hydrocarbons, and alcohols were dominant in the unfermented hongeo samples, whereas pyrazines, indoles, phenols and sulfur compounds appeared from the early or middle stage and increased until the end of fermentation. The significant increase in abundance and relative content of volatile compounds at the initial fermented stage indicated that the metabolic activity of microorganisms plays an important role in the formation of the unique flavor. We present SPME/GC-MS as a useful tool for monitoring the volatile compounds of hongeo during fermentation, and provide important information for investigating the mechanism of unique flavor formation in hongeo products.

J		Chang-Cheng Zhao; Kashif Ameer; Jong-Bang Eun							Effects of various drying conditions and methods on drying kinetics and retention of bioactive compounds in sliced persimmon.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To obtain the predominant drying speed period of sliced persimmon during hot air drying, the aim of this study was to evaluate drying kinetics, effective diffusivity and its activation energy under different drying temperatures (50, 60 and 70 °C). Besides, the bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and microstructure after drying were also compared with those of freeze-dried persimmon. Results. Showed that water loss of persimmon slices during hot air drying followed the second-order kinetic model. The effective diffusivities of sliced persimmon at 50, 60 and 70 °C were 6.45 * 10-7, 7.48 * 10-7, and 9.08 * 10-7 m2 s-1, respectively. No significant (p> 0.05) differences in the drying rate at different drying temperatures (50, 60 and 70 °C) after 180 min of drying were observed. Contrarily, increase of hot air drying temperature resulted in a significant decreases in majority of bioactive compounds. While, considering the high price and time consumption of freeze-drying technique, as well as the fact that higher drying temperatures did not further affect the drying rate after a certain drying time, controlling the temperature gradient during hot air drying processing might be useful in minimizing energy input and improving the retention of bioactive compounds during the processing of dried persimmon in food industry.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Tofu whey, as the liquid by-product of tofu manufacturing, contain a high content of valuable nutrients. While, few studies have focused on the potential use of tofu whey as food ingredient. The study was aimed to evaluate effects of tofu whey powder (TWP) supplementation on physicochemical and functional properties of wheat flour pan bread. TWP-added breads showed significant decrease in baking loss but increase in specific volume, antioxidant activities, total phenolic and flavonoid contents of bread samples when increasing the addition levels of TWP. Isoflavone composition analysis showed genistein, daidzein, and glycitein as three major isoflavones, which indicated that the transformation of isoflavone glucosidic conjugates to aglycones was occurred during the bread making. While, at 4% or above addition levels, bread quality was negatively affected by TWP regarding both texture, color profiles and overall acceptance. As a by-product, TWP showed significant potential to improve the bread physicochemical and functional properties.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					MADS box transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in different biological processes, for example, fruit ripening. However, the roles of MADS box TFs in papaya fruit ripening remain a little know. In this study, a novel MADS-box gene was found, named as CpMADS4, and its expression level was decreased during fruit ripening. Protein-protein interaction assays proved that CpMADS4 interacted with CpNAC3. Both CpMADS4 and CpNAC3 had transcriptional activation activities. Moreover, CpMADS4 and CpNAC3 could specifically bind to and activate the promoters of ethylene signal genes CpERF9 and CpEIL5, and the activate activities would be enhanced when both CpMADS4 and CpNAC3 existed at the same time. Our results suggested that CpMADS4 might function in fruit ripening through interacting with CpNAC3 and regulating ethylene signal genes CpERF9 and CpEIL5, which provided new views about the functions of papaya MADS box TFs in regulating fruit ripening.

Sok.] juice modulates the intestinal mucosal barrier and increases the abundance of Akkermansia in the gut in association with polyphenols.		Journal of Functional Foods					Polyphenols have long been used as functional compounds and are beneficial for host immunity and gut health. This three-phased study investigated the function of Ouli fermented juice (OF) in improving the immunity of cyclophosphamide (CTX)-immunosuppressed mice and regulating their intestinal microbiota and mucosal barrier. Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation increased the phenolic content in the OF. OF effectively improved host immunity and the intestinal mucosal barrier, including increasing serum immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, and IgM levels and secreted IgA (sIgA) levels in the colon, and reduced CTX-induced pathological damage to the spleen and jejunum. Importantly, OF effectively increased the abundance of Lachnospiracea, Roseburia, Akkermansia, and butyric acid-producing microbes, subsequently increasing the levels of short chain fatty acids in the colon. OF with polyphenols exhibited better efficacy at altering the intestinal flora, which might affect the host immunity by changing the host-mucosal barrier-microbiota interaction.

Foods					In the present study, the properties of the Lactiplantibacillus (Lpb.) plantarum WiKim0112 isolated from kimchi were evaluated by comparing its probiotic properties to those of Lpb. plantarum WCFS1 and KACC 11451 isolated from different sources. In both pH 2 and 3, media containing pepsin, Wikim0112, and WCFS1 showed higher cell viability than KACC11451. Viability of all Lpb. plantarum strains in a medium containing pancreatin and bile salt oxgall was significantly decreased compared to the control. WCFS1 showed the highest thermotolerance, followed by Wikim0112 and KACC11451. Wikim0112 showed a similar level of antibacterial activity to WCFS1 and exhibited an overall higher antibacterial activity than KACC11451 against six pathogens. All Lpb. plantatum strains showed high antioxidant activities in SOD, DPPH, and ABTS assays, especially Wikim0112 and WCFS1 exhibited a higher antioxidant activity than KACC11451. All Lpb. plantarum strains showed approximately 60-62% adhesion rates to Caco-2 cells. Moreover, in LPS-stimulated Caco-2 cells, all Lpb. plantarum strains significantly decreased the mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha); Wikim0112 significantly increased the mRNA expression of IL-4 and IFN-gamma. Wikim0112 was resistant to streptomycin and vancomycin, whereas WCFS1 and KACC11451 were resistant to four (clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) and three (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and vancomycin) antibiotics, respectively. These results, taken together, indicated that compared to Lpb. plantarum strains isolated from different sources, Wikim0112 showed desirable probiotic properties, suggesting its potential applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Due to the high price and limited supply of Panax notoginseng, a large number of samples adulterated with the leaves appear in the market. A group of new malonyl ginsenosides were exclusively detected in the P. notoginseng leaves (PNL). Targeted isolation of the malonyl ginsenosides was guided by UPLC-QDa MS, HRMS, 1D/2D NMR, and chemical methods were used for structural identification. A selected ion monitoring method was developed based on UPLC-QDa MS to detect the adulterations. In addition, the anti-inflammatory activities and the collision-induced dissociation features of the isolated saponins were studied. As a result, eight new 3-OH malonylated dammarane-type triterpene oligoglycosides (notoginsenosides L3-L10) were obtained from PNL. Adulteration with PNL can be easily detected with limit of detection as low as 0.06%. To sum up, the isolated ginsenosides can be used as quality markers for fraud detection, which will promote the quality control of the notoginseng products.										2021	69	16	4849	4857	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00382					FSTA:2021-09-Ge4640

Food Bioscience					Intense adhesiveness, softness and sourness are usually organoleptic and textural defects in dry-cured ham. To improve sensory and flavor qualities of defective dry-cured ham, biceps femoris of Jinhua ham with sensory defects were subjected to different levels of ultrasound-assisted heating (control group, 300 W & 40 °C, 300 W & 50 °C, 1000 W & 40 °C, and 1000 W & 50 °C). Sensory scores, texture, dynamic rheology, thermostability, water distribution and volatile compounds of ham samples were investigated among these treatments. The treatment (1000 W & 50 °C) improved sensory scores than that of other treatments (P < 0.001) and a decrease of 0.65-folds in adhesiveness values was observed at the group of 1000 W & 50 °C compared with the control; the enthalpy of actin decreased and the population of free water from 2.71% of control group increased to 11.35% of 1000 W & 50 °C, indicating that intense denaturation of proteins could accelerate protein aggregation and decrease the interaction between water and protein molecules, which further contributed to the improvement of texture of defective dry-cured ham after ultrasound. Furthermore, the treatment of 1000 W & 50 °C decreased the content of rancid and sour compounds, and accelerated the formation of esters. Partial least square regression confirmed that the decrease of rancid and sour compounds improved flavor quality of defective dry-cured ham.

Food Control					Jinhua ham is one of high quality dry-cured products, and processing methods play a key role in developing the taste attributes of Jinhua ham. To investigate the effect of processing methods on sensory attributes and taste substances of Jinhua ham, this work highlighted the changes of sensory characteristics, texture parameters, water distribution and metabolite profiles, and further discussed the contribution of metabolites to the development of taste and richness in both traditional-processed and modern-processed hams. The modern-processed hams showed higher taste scores and richness intensities than that of traditional processing. The populations of immobilized water significantly increased from raw ham to the later stage of dry-ripening, accompanied by a decrease in the populations of free water during the processing of traditional and modern procedures, while higher populations (more than 2-fold) of free water were shown in the ham of modern processing at the end of post-ripening compared with traditional-processed ham. 1H NMR-based metabolomics revealed that free amino acids, small peptides and organic acids were the most intense response in developing taste and richness intensities of modern-processed ham. Partial least square discriminant analysis and taste-active values further demonstrated that glutamic acid, lactate, glycerol, anserine and creatine were responsible for the higher taste and richness intensities of modern-processed ham.

Journal of Functional Foods					This study investigated Grifola frondosa active substances extracted from low-concentration (55%) ethanol (GF55) and their role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism disorders (GLMDs). The main components of GF55 were identified as fatty acids and coumarins by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS After the intervention of GF55, the serum and liver lipid level, aspartate transaminase, alanine aminotransferase, free fatty acid, total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, liver histopathological and key genes, short-chain fatty acids and intestinal flora changed. Compared with HFD, GF55 treatment up-regulated the expressions of protein kinase B, glucokinase, adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-alpha and cholesterol 7-alpha hydroxylase, down-regulated the expressions of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor-1c at the mRNA and protein levels (P< 0.01). Moreover, GF55 administration enriched the abundances of Alistipes, Paraprevotella and Ruminococcus2, whereas decreased the abundances of Romboutsia, Turicibacter and Coprococcus. GF55 might ameliorate GLMDs by modulating the functional composition of intestinal flora.

Food Chemistry					Passion fruit is a tropical liana of the Passiflora family that is commonly consumed throughout the world due to its attractive aroma and flavor. However, very limited information is available on the mechanism of aroma formation and composition of the passion fruit during ripening. Therefore, HS-SPME-GC/MS combined with transcriptome analysis was used to study the mechanism of aroma formation during passion fruit ripening. The profile analyzed included 148 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and related differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Compared with SA, 85 VOCs and related DEGs were identified as significantly upregulated at the SB and SC stages, including esters, alcohols, ketones, hydrocarbons, alkanes, and aldehydes. Two main pathways, ester and amino acid metabolism, and related genes were analyzed with VOC biosynthesis in passion fruit. This study is the first analysis of passion fruit VOC formation and provides new insights into the flavor mechanism and quality breeding of passion fruit.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this research is to develop composite (CG-TA) films by using chitosan (CS)/gelatin (GL)/tannic acid (TA), for fresh-cut apples preservation. TA was used as the crossing-linking agent to improve the mechanical and barrier properties, and as the active substance to improve the anti-ultraviolet and antioxidant abilities of the chitosan/gelatin (CG) film. With the incorporation of TA from 0 to 1 wt%, the tensile strength of the CG film was increased while the water vapor and oxygen permeability of the film were decreased. The CG-TA films containing more than 0.5 wt% of TA could effectively block most of UV light. The DPPH radical scavenging assay significant increased to 89.3% when the concentration of TA reached 2 wt%. Finally, CG and CG-TA films, as an active packaging material, were used to preserve the cold-stored fresh-cut apples. Compared with CG film, the CG-TA films obtained better performance on decreasing weight loss, delaying browning degree, inhibiting the lipid oxidase activity and decreasing the malondialdehyde content during 10 d of storage under 4 °C. Therefore, CG-TA films were expected to be a new active packaging material for preserving fresh-cut apples.

Food & Function					Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury can lead to mortality and severe long-term disabilities including cerebral palsy and brain injury. However, the treatment options for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury are limited. Apigenin is abundantly present in vegetables, celery, and chamomile tea with diverse biological functions, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, antioxidant, and anticancer effects. However, it has not yet been reported whether apigenin exerts a neuroprotective effect against neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. In this study, we investigated whether apigenin could ameliorate HI brain injury and explored the associated mechanism using in vivo experiments. We found that apigenin remarkably reduced the infarct volume and ameliorated cerebral edema, decreased inflammatory response, inhibited apoptosis, promoted the recovery of tissue structure, and improved prognosis following HI brain injury. Mechanistically, we found that apigenin exerted a neuroprotective effect against HI brain injury by activating the PI3K/Akt/Nrf2 pathway. In summary, all these results demonstrate that apigenin could be a potential therapeutic approach for neonatal hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	5	2270	2281	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02555k					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10333
J		Changfeng Li; Panpan Cao; Peng Wu; Wenwen Yu; Gilbert, R. G.; Enpeng Li							Effects of endogenous proteins on rice digestion during small intestine (in vitro) digestion.		Food Chemistry					Rices with higher protein contents are nutritionally desirable. This study investigates the effects of endosperm proteins on starch in vitro digestibility in cooked and uncooked rice, and the mechanisms underlying any changes. The composition of rice endosperm proteins and the morphologies of proteins and starch granules were determined by SDS-PAGE and confocal microscopy. Starch molecular fine structure was examined using size-exclusion chromatography. In vitro digestion showed that the digestion rate coefficients (k) of cooked rice flour were significantly lower than those of isolated starch or of a starch-protein mixture. (e. G for samples from SWR4, k is 9.6, 12.9 and 11.6*10-2 min-1 for cooked rice flour, isolated starch and starch-protein mixture, respectively). For uncooked samples, digestion rate coefficients were 1.4, 1.5 and 1.8*10-2 min-1 for flour, starch-protein mixture and starch, respectively. The digestion rates in cooked samples were higher than those in uncooked samples. This suggests that, in cooked samples, starch digestion rates are more affected by the protein physical barrier than by some chemical effect (e.g.hydrogen bonding between protein and starch), while in uncooked samples, a chemical effect from protein is more pronounced than a physical barrier from protein.

Protein-polyphenol functional ingredients: the foaming properties of lactoferrin are enhanced by forming complexes with procyanidin.		Food Chemistry					The solution turbidity and intrinsic fluorescence quenching increased after procyanidin was mixed with lactoferrin. The addition of procyanidin also caused a reduction in the surface hydrophobicity of the lactoferrin, suggesting procyanidin bound to non-polar patches on lactoferrin's surfaces. Moreover, the binding interaction caused an appreciable alteration in the structure of both the polyphenol and protein. Thermodynamic analysis indicated the interaction was spontaneous and mainly driven by entropy changes, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions dominated. A computational docking simulation provided insights into the location of the most-likely binding sites on the protein, as well as the nature of the interaction forces involved. In particular, both hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding were found to be important. The binding of the procyanidin to the lactoferrin enhanced its foaming properties. These results may lead to the development of a new class of natural functional ingredients that can be used in food products to improve their quality attributes.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Edible coatings have been used as a medium for the incorporation of functional compounds to maintain postharvest quality parameters of fruits. In this study, we explored the influence of 1.5 g/100 mL hydroxyethyl cellulose coatings (HEC1.5), 1.5 g/100 mL sodium alginate coatings (SA1.5), and the composite coatings of 1.0 g/100 mL HEC and 0.5 g/100 mL SA (HEC1.0/SA0.5) containing asparagus waste extraction on quality of strawberry fruit. The fluorescence microscope and scanning electron microscope images showed that the HEC1.0/SA0.5 coatings displayed a continuous, smooth and porous structure. The HEC1.0/SA0.5 coatings also exhibited favorable anti-fungal activity against Penicillium italicum. Furthermore, the HEC1.0/SA0.5 coatings significantly delayed color change (DeltaE), reduced weight loss, and maintained total phenolic and flavonoid contents. These results indicated that the application of HEC and SA based edible coatings containing asparagus waste extract could be an effective, safe and environmentally friendly approach to maintain the quality and extend the shelf life of strawberry fruit.

J		Changhong Mu; Zebin Yuan; Xiuqin Ouyang; Pu Sun; Bo Wang							Non-destructive detection of blueberry skin pigments and intrinsic fruit qualities based on deep learning.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This paper proposes a novel method to improve accuracy and efficiency in detecting the quality of blueberry fruit, taking advantage of deep learning in classification tasks. We first collected "Tifblue" blueberries at seven different stages of maturity (10-70days after full bloom) and measured the pigments of the blueberry skin and the total sugar and the total acid of the pulp. We then established a skin pigment contents prediction network (SPCPN), based on the correlation between the pigments and blueberry pictures, and also a fruit intrinsic qualities prediction network (FIQPN), based on the correlation between the pigments and fruit qualities. Finally, the SPCPN and FIQPN were consolidated into the blueberry quality parameters prediction network (BQPPN). Results. The results showed that the anthocyanins in the blueberry skin were significantly correlated with the total sugar, total acid, and sugar/acid ratio of the fruit. After verification, the results also indicated that, for the prediction of anthocyanins, chlorophyll, and the anthocyanin/chlorophyll ratio, the SPCPN network model was found to achieve higher R2 (RMSE) values of 0.969 (0.139), 0.955 (0.005), 0.967 (15.4), respectively. The FIQPN network model was also able to evaluate the value of total sugar (R2=0.940, RMSE=4.905), total acid (R2=0.930, RMSE=2.034), and the sugar / acid ratio (R2=0.973, RMSE=0.580). Conclusion. The above results indicated the potential for utilizing deep learning technology to predict the quality indicators of blueberry before harvesting. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	8	3165	3175	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10945					FSTA:2021-09-Jf11962

Food Chemistry					China is one of the largest apple-growing areas in the world. Fluopyram (FLP) is a novel pesticide that has been widely used in agriculture. This work investigated the behavior of pesticides during enzymatic hydrolysis of apple juice and its effect on polygalacturonase (PG), apple juice yield, and flavor. The study findings revealed that 27.5% to 34.2% FLP was degraded during the enzymatic hydrolysis of apple. The three degradation products (P1, P2, and P3) were identified by a hybrid ion trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer. Based on toxicity assessment, it was found that carcinogenicity was higher for P2 and P3 than for FLP. Furthermore, FLP affected the yield and flavor of apple juice. FLP reduced yield by 4.8%, because FLP inhibited the activity of PG. Through molecular docking, it was found that there was an interaction between the active center of PG and FLP, resulting in a reduction in catalytic ability.

Food Chemistry					Trichlorfon is one of the most widely used organophosphorus pesticides in agriculture. In this study, the extent of transformation of trichlorfon to dichlorvos (DDVP), during the polygalacturonase (PG) treatment of apple pulp was monitored. A transformation pathway is proposed for trichlorfon molecules, based on density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The transformation of trichlorfon involves hydroxyl substitution and cleavage, which was confirmed by molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) and frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory. In addition, the toxicity of trichlorfon and its transformed products was analyzed using Ecological Structure Activity Relationships (ECOSAR) software. The binding sites of the two pesticides are located in the hydrophobic grooves of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) active site region and both pesticides form hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds with a large number of surrounding amino acid residues. DDVP binds more strongly with AChE, so it is a better AChE inhibitor and more toxic than trichlorfon.

Food Control					The removal of pesticide residues from fruits reduces the risk of pesticide exposure in humans. In this study, carbosulfan and trichlorfon residues removed from apple using ozone-microbubble treatment (OMBT), tap water, hypochlorous acid-water, ozone-water, and microbubble-water. The pesticide removal rates by OMBT ranged between 98% and 100%. In addition, OMBT had little effects on apple surface color. In addition, this work evaluated the interaction between apple matrix and pesticide molecules, including the binding sites and adsorption energy, and proposed a possible adsorption mechanism. OMBT is an effective technique for removing pesticide residues from fruits. The removal effect of pesticides may be related to the matrix components on the surface of fruits.

J		Changjian Li; Jian Ju; Yunfei Xie; Hang Yu; Yahui Guo; Weirong Yao; He Qian							Effects of interactions between polygalacturonase and pesticide residues during enzymatic hydrolysis on the yield of apple juice.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In industry, Polygalacturonase (PG) is typically used for enzymatic hydrolysis of fruit juice to increase the yield. In the present study, it was found that two pesticides, namely trichlorfon and carbosulfan, which are frequently applied to fruit trees, inhibited the activity of PG and reduced the yield of apple juice. The presence of trichlorfon and carbosulfan reduced the yield by 3.58% and 4.12% during enzymatic hydrolysis of apple juice, respectively. Undoubtedly, this might lead to enormous losses in the juice industry. Analysis of the catalytic mechanism of PG on pectin revealed that the N-acetyl-D-(+)-glucosamine (NAG-404) and tyrosine (TYR-197) residues in the active site played key roles in the process. Nonetheless, it was also determined that various moieties in the pesticides interacted with these amino acids, which led to a decrease in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Evaluation of the flavor components in enzymatically hydrolyzed apple juice demonstrated that the two pesticide residues could reduce the content of esters, alcohols, and acids by 6.75%, 4.64%, and 3.20%, respectively. Thus, pesticide residues would not only lead to a decrease in the juice yield and change in flavor but would also exhibit potential inhibitory effects on fruit ripening.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Microwave processing is a combined treatment of thermal and non-thermal effects on microorganisms and food ingredients. There may exist synergism between these two types of effects. The objective of this study was to explore the synergism of microwave thermal (i.e. temperature) and non-thermal effects on microbial inactivation and on fatty acids quality of pasteurized salmon fillets. Water bath processes with same time-temperature profiles and same microbial inactivation intensity were designed as control. Results. Showed that the microwave non-thermal effect on microbial inactivation was significantly (P< 0.05) enhanced by increasing temperatures. Compared with the microbial inactivation of thermal effect, the inactivation efficiency of microwave non-thermal effect increased from 22.18% to 35.25% while final temperatures of samples increased from 84 °C to 100 °C. Furthermore, with the same microbial inactivation intensity of 7.5-log CFU/g, microwave process retained better fatty acids quality in consideration of significantly higher (P< 0.05) PUFAs (especially for ARA, EPA and DHA) than those with water bath treatments. These results demonstrated that high temperatures could bring significant enhancement on microwave non-thermal effect, and microwave processing could provide better bacteria control and meanwhile retain higher product quality due to the synergism of microwave thermal and non-thermal effects.

Food Chemistry					Myofibrillar proteins (MPs), as a food-grade material, have the potential to improve the solubility and bioavailability of curcumin. However, the interaction mechanism between MPs and curcumin under charge regulation induced by alkaline pH and NaCl was unclear. In this study, the binding between curcumin and MPs at pH 12 was confirmed by the fluorescence quenching under different NaCl concentration (0, 0.3, 0.6 and 0.9 mol/L). Further kinetic experiments showed, MPs possessed a higher affinity to bind curcumin in the presence of NaCl, especially at 0.6 M NaCl. Followed pH shifting from 12 to 7 does not affect UV-Vis absorption spectra of protein-curcumin dispersions. The secondary structure of MPs was not affected by binding with curcumin. Formation of this stable complex can be explained by hydrophobic other than electrostatic interaction. Therefore, the presence of NaCl facilitated exposure of hydrophobic pocket to improve the binding affinity between curcumin and MPs due to the importance of hydrophobic interaction.

J		Changling Wu; Mingyu He; Li Zheng; Tian Tian; Fei Teng; Yang Li							Effect of cavitation jets on the physicochemical properties and structural characteristics of the okara protein.		Journal of Food Science					The structural and physicochemical properties of okara protein (OP) subjected to different cavitation jet (CJ) treatment times (0-15 min) were analyzed. In this study, the microstructure and apparent morphology of OP were analyzed by Raman spectrum, fluorescence spectrum, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Physicochemical properties, such as emulsion ability (EA), emulsion stability index (ESI), foaming characteristics (FC), foaming stability (FS), and solubility analysis of the OPs, were characterized. Raman spectrum analysis showed that CJ treatment caused increases in the ordered structure of OPs (alpha-helix, beta-sheet, and beta-turn), and the disulfide bond g-g-g and g-g-t modes, while it caused a decrease in the t-g-t mode. However, the tertiary structure of OP unfolded and mostly degraded into small subunits because of higher cavitation, shear and temperature effects. AFM observation indicated that CJ resulted in a more uniform distribution of OP. Moreover, changes in the structure of OP significantly affected its functional properties. The results showed that when CJ treatment time was 10 min, the solubility of OP was up to (28.721.26) %, the soluble protein content of okara was up to (10.44 0.03) g/100 g, and interface properties were better. In summary, OP has great potential for application in the food area, especially in emulsifying agent and foam system. Practical Application. The cavitation jet technology improves the structure and physical and chemical properties of the protein extracted from soybean residue (okara) and provides new ideas for the further development and utilization of soybean residue protein, which may lead to the production of high-value-added functional ingredients from the processing of soybean byproducts. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	10	4566	4576	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15891					FSTA:2022-02-Jn1404

Overall, mycotoxins assessed were detected across samples with 86% of samples containing at least one mycotoxin above respective decision limits; up to 66% of samples were found to be contaminated with at least three mycotoxins. Findings demonstrated that deoxynivalenol, sterigmatocystin, alternariol and enniatin B were the most common mycotoxins, while low to marginal detection rates were observed for all other mycotoxins with none of the samples containing fusarenon-X, HT-2-toxin and neosolaniol. Isolated cases of deoxynivalenol (maximum: 2385 g/kg), aflatoxins (AFB1 (maximum: 30.2 g/kg) /AFG1 (maximum: 23.1 g/kg)), and zearalenone (maximum: 1793 g/kg) in excess of local and European regulatory limits were found. Kruskal-Wallis testing for pairwise comparisons showed commercial feed had significantly higher contamination for deoxynivalenol and its acylated derivatives, ochratoxin A and fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), whereas forages had significantly higher alternariol; in addition to significantly higher fumonisin B1 contamination for Limpopo coupled with significantly higher enniatin B and sterigmatocystin for Free State. Statistically significant Spearman correlations (p< 0.01) were also apparent for ratios for deoxynivalenol/fumonisin B1 (rs=0.587) and zearalenone/alternariol methylether (rs=0.544). © 2021 by the authors.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					The present study aims to evaluate the effects of enzyme, ultrasound, and ultrasound-assisted enzyme treatments at different ultrasound times on the quality of the spent-hen breast meat (SHBM). The enzyme, ultrasound, and ultrasound-assisted enzyme treatments had a slight adverse effect on the color and pH, significantly reduced shear force, and increased water holding capacity (WHC) (P< 0.05), but the shear force and WHC gradually worsened with the extension of ultrasound radiation time over 20 min. Low-field NMR results showed that ultrasound-assisted treatment increases the percentage of immobilized water (T21) in the meat by promoting the migration and uniform distribution of water; thus, improving the WHC of meat. Myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI), myofibril microstructure and rupture status revealed that enzymes and ultrasound softened meat texture by destroying muscle fiber structure. These results indicated that ultrasound technology is a promising auxiliary method to improve meat quality, and ultrasound with enzymes has a synergistic effect on the improvement of meat quality.

Food & Function					The biosafety assessment of novel human milk fat substitutes (HMFs) from microalgae oils of Nannochloropsis oculata and Schizochytrium sp. was evaluated by testing the cytotoxic activity using IEC-6 cells, and by conducting a sub-chronic 28-day dietary study using Sprague-Dawley (SD) suckling rats in this study. The results of the cytotoxic activity of IEC-6 cells treated with HMFs showed no apparent effect on cell viability at the tested concentrations (0-1000 mug mL-1). For the 28-day sub-chronic study, five rat dietary feeds with 7.5% fat were designed to have the DHA content in the range from 0 to 2.0% using corn oil as a basal oil. After the 28-day treatment, SD rats fed HMFs did not show toxicity signs and adverse effects, based on the results of clinical observation, body weight, food consumption, behavior, hematology, clinical chemistry, and necropsy findings. These results could lead to the conclusion that the inclusion of the new synthesized HMFs into the pre-weaning SD rat diet was acceptable for SD rats and did not exhibit toxic characteristics and adverse features, indicating that the HMFs from microalgal oils were safe and had the potential to be used as a promising feedstock in infant formula. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	7	2972	2984	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03000g					FSTA:2021-08-Nh1867

M.; Wenjian Yang							Transcriptome analysis reveals the underlying mechanism of nanocomposite packaging in delaying quality deterioration of Flammulina velutipes.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					To expound the molecular mechanism of nanocomposite packaging material (Nano-PM) in delaying quality deterioration of Flammulina velutipes during storage, transcriptome analysis was conducted to observe the changes of gene expression in F. velutipes that was packaged in Nano-PM, polyethylene packaging material (Normal-PM) and no packaging material (No-PM). In comparison with Normal-PM, 379 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Nano-PM packaged F. velutipes, comprising of 161 up-regulated genes and 218 down-regulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis indicated that Nano-PM improved the stress resistance of F. velutipes by up-regulating RBOHF and msp2, which were related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. Nano-PM also ensured sufficient energy supply by regulating oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Moreover, the regulation of gene expression also delayed programmed cell death (PCD) and lignification. Furthermore, the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) results were also in accordance with transcriptome analysis. Therefore, Nano-PM could regulate the expression of specific genes, which in turn alleviated quality deterioration of F. velutipes during storage.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Lignification is an important inducement of quality deterioration of postharvest Flammulina velutipes. In this study, phenylpropanoid pathway and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolisms were taken as breakthrough points to investigate the lignification mechanism in harvested F. velutipes packaged in nanocomposite packaging material (Nano-PM). In comparison with polyethylene packaging material (Normal-PM) and no packaging material (No-PM), Nano-PM prevented the decrease of L* value and the increase of firmness. Nano-PM also maintained a better microstructure. Furthermore, Nano-PM reduced the deposition of lignin by suppressing the enzymes activities involved in phenylpropanoid pathway. In addition, the regulation of ROS in mitochondria alleviated the accumulation of Ca2+ and inhibited the programmed cell death (PCD) process, which ultimately delayed the lignification process. These results indicated that Nano-PM delayed the lignification process by regulating phenylpropanoid pathway and the accumulation of ROS in mitochondria.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Distribution of aldehydes between headspace (HS) and inner matrix (IM) of bulk oil or oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion was determined and contents of aldehydes were compared with other oxidation parameters in soybean oil or O/W emulsion during 50°C autoxidation. Bulk oil matrix had higher portion of IM aldehydes than O/W emulsion. HS aldehydes in O/W emulsion reflected aldehyde content better than in bulk oil. Moisture content in soybean oil increased distinctively before the generation of oxidation products including hydroperoxides and volatiles. HS aldehydes and other oxidation parameters were simultaneously increased in soybean oil. In case of O/W emulsion, HS aldehydes had a sudden increase point while lipid hydroperoxides and conjugated did not show such increase during autoxidation. HS aldehydes reflected oxidation stage better in O/W emulsion than in bulk oil based on partition distribution and linear changes during autoxidation. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.			lee, jaehwan/0000-0003-0118-6233							2021	30	9	1195	1203	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00956-2					FSTA:2022-01-Ne0023

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In the present work we propose the use of accelerating energies (microwaves and ultrasounds) to the maceration process of sherry vinegar with citrus fruit peels (orange and lemon). For the application of microwaves, an experimental design has been developed in order to optimize the maceration conditions. To evaluate the effect of these energies on the maceration, the volatile and polyphenolic content of the samples has been analyzed, as well as their sensory characteristics. Results. Orange peel provided a higher number of volatile and polyphenolic compounds to the vinegar, while lemon's yielded a greater amount of some of them. The multivariate analysis showed that the samples macerated using microwaves were the most similar to the samples macerated in the traditional way. This aspect was corroborated by the sensory analysis, which was more noticeable when orange peel was used in the macerations. Conclusion. Therefore, it seems that the use of microwaves to accelerate maceration is a good alternative to the traditional method of making sherry vinegars macerated with citrus peel, since it cuts down the maceration time from 3days to just a few minutes. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Chanjuan Lai; Linfang Hu; Jin Tu; Mingliang Li; Qibin Cui; Leiyan Wu							Effects of different alcohol and ultrasonic treatments on thermal and structural properties of zein-starch sodium octenyl succinate composite nanoparticles.		Journal of Food Science					The objective of this study is to prepare zein/starch sodium octenyl succinate composite nanoparticles (ZSPs) via anti-solvent precipitation technology and characterize their colloidal properties. The effects of polar solvents, ultrasonic treatment time, and concentrations of starch sodium octenyl succinate were investigated. We measured the particle size distribution, hydrophobicity, and apparent structures of the composite nanoparticles. Ultrasonic treatment time (0-25 min) was found to play an important role in composite nanoparticle formation. The ZSP nanoparticles were with an average particle size in the range of 70 to 110 nm. When the ultrasonic treatment time exceeds 25 min, ZSPs became macroscopic particles. The fluorescence spectrum and three-phase contact angle indicated that ZSPs presented hydrophilicity with largest three-phase contact angle, which was 65.1°. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy revealed that hydrophilic SSOS absorbed on the surface of zein nanoparticles via Van der Waals to improve their water solubility. The changes in solvent polarity and zein self-assembly are considered to be the main driving force for composite nanoparticles conformational transitions from alpha-helix to beta-sheet. Differential scanning calorimetry analysis indicated that ethanol combined ultrasonic treatment (10 min) was beneficial to enhance the thermal stability of composite nanoparticles, causing the highest Tg of 153.6°C. This work aims to provide a practical reference for formulating delivery systems using bioactive compounds containing zein as a carrier biopolymer. Practical Application. This work aims to provide a practical reference for formulating encapsulants for food and other bioactive compounds containing zein as a carrier biopolymer. Zein/starch sodium octenyl succinate composite nanoparticles formulated in this study provide novel stabilizers for emulsification systems or carriers of bioactive substances that can enhance the nutritional value, taste, or shelf life of foods. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	8	3574	3588	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15845					FSTA:2021-12-Le1954
J		Chanjun Sun; Aernouts, B.; Saeys, W.							Effects of harvest time, fruit size and cultivar on the bulk optical properties of Satsuma mandarin.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					As Satsuma mandarin is a multi-layered fruit, the optical properties of the different tissue layers influence the performance of spectroscopy-based quality detection models. Therefore, the variation in the bulk optical properties (BOP) of the inner (juice vesicles) and outer (flavedo) tissue layer of Satsuma mandarin was investigated for different harvest times, fruit sizes and cultivars. Satsuma mandarin fruit from three different cultivars (Iwasaki, Okitsu and Goku Wase) were harvested at three different times around the recommended harvest date and the BOP of the inner and outer tissue layers were estimated from double integrating spheres measurements. Along the harvest time, the absorption peak related to carotenoids in the bulk absorption coefficient (mua) spectrum increased in both tissue layers, while the values attributed to chlorophylls decreased in the flavedo. Moreover, a slightly increasing trend over the harvest time was observed in the bulk scattering coefficient (mus) spectra of juice vesicles, especially at the early stage. The mua values of both tissue layers and the mus values of juice vesicles deviated among different fruit sizes, which can be related to the development stage. Smaller fruit presented a higher carotenoids concentration in juice vesicles, an advanced color change in flavedo throughout the maturation stages and higher mus values in juice vesicles at earlier maturation stages. The mua differences in pigment absorption among different cultivars were related to the maturation order. Earlier maturing cultivars possessed higher mua values related to carotenoids absorption in juice vesicles and advanced color changes in flavedo. The mus values of the flavedo differed among the cultivars and these differences were enhanced during maturation. These insights in the sources of variation in the bulk optical properties of Satsuma mandarin tissues can be used for simulation-based optimal design of an optical measurement configuration and interpretation of the acquired signals in spectroscopy-based quality detection and monitoring.

Carcass composition, meat quality, calpain activity, fatty acid composition and ribonucleotide content in southern Thai native goats and three-way crossbred goats.		Foods					Carcass composition, meat quality, calpain activity, fatty acid composition, and ribonucleotide content were examined and compared between male Southern Thai native goats (NG, n = 10) and three-way crossbred goats (CG, 50% Boer * 25% Saanen * 25% Southern Thai native, n = 10). All animals were fed 1.5% body weight of concentrate (16% protein and 70% total digestible nutrients) and fresh Napier grass for 4 months. At the end of raising period, the final weight between the two genotypes was not significantly different. The percentage of carcass, bone, and fat of CG were higher than those of NG. NG presented lower shear force values, insoluble and total collagen content but higher collagen solubility and calpain-1 activity at 24 h postmortem. Additionally, NG meat was high in monounsaturated fatty acids but low in saturated fatty acids. However, the amount of ribonucleotide was no significant difference between two genotypes. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					The effects of different starch sources (ground corn (CO), ground cassava (CA) and pineapple stem starch (PI)) and ageing period (14 and 21 days) on meat characteristics of Holstein steers were investigated. Starch sources had no effect on meat characteristics, while meat aged for 14 days had less thawing loss than that aged for 21 days. Meat from steers fed PI had higher levels of inosine monophosphate (IMP) than the others (p< 0.05). With increasing duration of ageing, the content of IMP and guanosine monophosphate in the meat decreased, while the content of hypoxanthine increased (p< 0.05). Meat from steers fed CO had the highest oleic acid but the lowest erucic acid (p< 0.05) in contrast to meat from steers fed PI, which had the lowest oleic acid but the highest erucic acid. Steers fed CO appeared to produce healthier meat as this was positively associated with monounsaturated fatty acid content. Meat from steers fed PI had higher levels of IMP, which may be associated with good taste. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					High-pressure processing is a nonthermal method of food processing that is widely used in sterilization and enzyme inactivation. Although some works on technological parameters and quality evaluation have been performed, the mechanism of high pressure on food is still unclear. Due to the complexity of food ingredients, a tremendously important tripeptide in food proteins, orthorhombic L-glutathione, was employed in this work. In addition, in situ methods such as high-pressure Raman, infrared, and X-ray diffraction were used to investigate the structural changes in the pressure range of 0-10 GPa. Experimental results showed that the sample underwent two phase transitions in pressure intervals of 1.8-2.2 and 4.1-5.3 GPa. In addition, the strength of the hydrogen bonds (NH...O; OH...O; SH...O; CH...O) also changed in the two pressure intervals. This work may have potential research value for revealing the mechanism of high-pressure processing on food proteins.

Food Analytical Methods					To simultaneously determine the presence of four amide fungicides (amisulbrom, boscalid, fluopicolide, and silthiofam) in samples of grape wine, a method involving gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) was developed. Samples of the grape wine were diluted with water, after which they were purified and concentrated through solid-phase extraction, and analyzed using GC-MS/MS. Isotope-labeled internal standards were used to correct the matrix effects. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) of all four amide fungicides was 0.6 mug kg-1 and 2.0 mug kg-1. The average recoveries were in the range of 76.5-93.4% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) below 5.4%, which were measured at three concentration levels.

DEAE anion exchange chromatography and gel filtration were further performed to obtained the purified fraction NNLP-I-I, the molecular weight of which was 16.4 kDa. The monosaccharide composition analysis and linkage units determination showed that the fraction NNLP-I-I was a pectic polysaccharide. In addition, the NMR spectra analysis revealed that NNLP-I-I mainly consisted of a homogalacturonan backbone and rhamnogalacturonan I, containing a long HG region and short RG-I region, with AG-II and 1-3 linked rhamnose as side chains. The biological studies demonstrated that NNLP-I-I displayed antioxidant properties through mediating the Nrf2-regulated intestinal cellular antioxidant defense, which could protect cultured intestinal cells from oxidative stress and improve the intestinal function of aged mice. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	21	10828	10841	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02354c					FSTA:2022-03-Jq2460

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Neointima formation and atherosclerosis are the main complications after the endovascular intervention and vascular surgery, and there are no effective drugs. Propolis is a kind of resin substance produced by honeybees and has numerous health-beneficial effects. In this study, we evaluated the effects of propolis (125 and 250 mg.kg-1.day-1, 6 weeks) on carotid restenosis in hypercholesterolemia rabbits. Propolis significantly ameliorated the degree of carotid restenosis, inhibited neointima hyperplasia, reduced serum lipids profile, and enhanced the anti-oxidative activities in hypercholesterolemia rabbits. Furthermore, propolis reduced the plasma levels of C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and inhibited the expression of CD68, TLR4, NF-kappaB p65, MMP-9, and TNF-alpha in the carotid arteries. The results indicate that propolis has a protective effect on carotid restenosis in rabbits, which is associated with regulating blood lipids, inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation, and its anti-inflammatory activity may be related to inhibit TLR4-mediated NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Practical applications. Restenosis is a primary challenge in angioplasty and atherosclerotic treatment. Hyperlipidemia can induce inflammation and accelerate the formation of restenosis. Recently, natural products have been widely used to prevent intimal hyperplasia of common cardiovascular diseases. Propolis is currently a popular functional food, but the role of propolis on carotid restenosis after angioplasty and its underlying mechanism remains unclear. This study showed that propolis inhibits the effect of carotid restenosis in hypercholesterolemia rabbits. The results of this study may provide a basis for propolis to prevent and treat vascular restenosis. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13577					FSTA:2021-08-Lg1317

Food Chemistry					D-Allulose, a low-calorie rare sugar with potential as sucrose substitute for diabetics, can be produced using D-allulose 3-epimerase (DAE). Here, we characterized a putative thermostable DAE from Pirellula sp. SH-Sr6A (PsDAE), with a half-life of 6 h at 60 °C. Bioconversion of 500 g/L D-fructose using immobilized PsDAE on epoxy support yielded 152.7 g/L D-allulose, which maintained 80% of the initial activity after 11 reuse cycles. A multienzyme cascade system was developed to convert sucrose to D-allulose comprising sucrose invertase, D-glucose isomerase and PsDAE. Fruit juices were treated using this system to convert the high-calorie sugars, such as sucrose, D-glucose, and D-fructose, into D-allulose. The content of D-allulose among total monosaccharides in the treated fruit juice remained between 16 and 19% during 15 reaction cycles.

J		Chao Li; Shanglong Chen; Jin Sha; Jue Cui; Juping He; Junning Fu; Yingbin Shen							Extraction and purification of total flavonoids from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. and evaluation of their antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities.		Food Science & Nutrition					The health benefits and promising medical treatment potential of total flavonoids from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. (TFELDC) have been recognized. The process parameters of extracting total flavonoids from Eupatorium lindleyanum DC. By ultrasonic-microwave synergistic extraction (UMSE) were optimized, and they were purified by AB-8 macroporous resin in the current study. In addition, the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of the purified TFELDC (PTFELDC) were evaluated. The results showed that the optimal parameters of UMSE were as follows: ethanol volume fraction 71.5%, L/ S ratio 12.2 ml/g, microwave power 318 W, and extraction time 143 s. After TFELDC were purified by AB-8 macroporous resin, the total flavonoid contents of PTFELDC increased from 208.181.60 to 511.193.21 mg RE/g FDS. Compared with TFELDC, the content of total flavonoids in PTFELDC was increased by 2.46 times. The antioxidant activities of PTFELDC were assessed using DPPH radical, superoxide anion radical, reducing power, and ferric reducing antioxidant power assays, and the IC50 values were found to be 37.13, 19.62, 81.22, and 24.72 mug/ml, respectively. The enzyme inhibitory activities of PTFELDC were measured using lipase, alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and acetylcholinesterase assays with the IC50 values 1.38,2.08,1.63, and 0.58 mg/ml, respectively. By comparing with their positive controls, it was found that PTFELDC had good antioxidant activities, and lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities, However, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity was relatively weaker. These results suggested that PTFELDC have a promising potential as natural antioxidant, antilipidemic, and hypoglycemic drugs used in functional foods or pharmaceuticals. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Chao Li; Wei Zhang; Cancan Wei; Xin Gao; Shuhong Mao; Fuping Lu; Hui-Min Qin							Continuous spectrophotometric assay for high-throughput screening of predominant D-allulose 3-epimerases.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					D-Allulose is an attractive noncaloric sugar substitute with numerous health benefits, which can be biosynthesized by D-allulose 3-epimerases (DAEases). However, enzyme instability under harsh industrial reaction conditions hampered its practical applications. Here, we developed a continuous spectrophotometric assay (CSA) for the efficient analysis of D-allulose in a mixture. Furthermore, a high-throughput screening strategy for DAEases was developed using CSA by coupling DAEase with a NADH-dependent ribitol dehydrogenase, enabling high-throughput screening of DAEase variants with desired properties. The variant M15S/P40N/S209N exhibited a half-life of 22 h at 60°C and an 8.7°C increase of the T5060 value, with a 1.2-fold increase of activity. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the improvement of thermostability and activity was due to some new hydrogen bonds between chains at the dimer interface and between the residue and the substrate D-fructose. This work offers a robust tool and theoretical basis for the improvement of DAEases, which will benefit the enzymatic biosynthesis of D-allulose and promote its industrial application.										2021	69	39	11637	11645	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04716					FSTA:2022-02-Ac2240
J		Chao Li; Shilin Zhou; Xiong Fu; Qiang Huang; Qing Chen							In vitro digestibility and prebiotic activities of a bioactive polysaccharide from Moringa oleifera leaves.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this study, the digestion and fermentation properties of a bioactive polysaccharide (MOP-2) purified from Moringa oleifera leaves and its impact on the human colonic microbiota were determined using simulated saliva-gastrointestinal digestion and human fecal fermentation models in vitro. The results showed that the simulated saliva and gastric juices had no effect on the average molecular weight (MW) of MOP-2. The MW of MOP-2 slightly decreased from 155.29 to 145.02 kDa during intestinal digestion, and the reducing sugar content increased from 0.159 to 0.234 mg/ml, indicating that MOP-2 was partially degraded during intestinal digestion. During fermentation, MOP-2 was largely used by human fecal inoculums. Notably, MOP-2 could significantly regulate the structure of the microbial community by improving the relative abundances of some beneficial gut microbiota, such as Phascolarctobacterium, Coprococcus, Roseburia, and Bacteroides. Additionally, after fermentation for 48 hr, MOP-2 could significantly improve the production of short-chain fatty acids, especially n-butyric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, and n-valeric acid. These results suggested that MOP-2 could potentially be a gut microbiota manipulator aimed at promoting gut health. Practical applications. Gut microbial community is an important part of the human intestinal environment. The health of gut microbiota is closely associated with host heath. This work reported that a polysaccharide (MOP-2) purified from Moringa oleifera leaves could modulate the microbial structure by improving the relative abundances of some beneficial gut microbiota, which provided useful information for the application of MOP-2 as a prebiotic additive in food industry. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13944					FSTA:2022-03-Jq2949
J		Chao Liao; Luxin Wang							Evaluation of the bacterial populations present in Spring Mix salad and their impact on the behavior of Escherichia coli O157:H7.		Food Control					The native bacterial populations present in three brands of Spring Mix salads (brands A, B, and C) were analyzed by plating and 16S rRNA gene sequencing during 15 days of storage at 4 °C. While the traditional plating method did not show significant differences among three brands or between before and after storage, 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the "brand" factor significantly impacted the diversity and abundance of native bacterial populations. In order to evaluate the interaction between native bacteria and Escherichia coli O157:H7 (ECO157), day-0 and day-15 salad homogenates were inoculated with ECO157 (a final concentration of 5.5 log CFU/ml). Inoculated samples were stored at 4 °C for additional 15 days and the behavior of inoculated ECO157 was monitored by plating samples on CHROMagar O157 agar on days 0,5, 10 and 15. The top four phyla of bacteria present in all three brands of salad were Proteobacteria, Bacterioidetes, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes. Changes in the relative abundance and diversity of bacterial populations were significantly altered by inoculation of ECO157. The inoculation remarkably decreased the beta diversity (Jaccard distance) of the bacterial populations (P=0.005). During the additional 15-day storage, culturable ECO157 cells decreased over the entire storage time. However, fluctuations of culturable ECO157 cells were observed on days 5 and 10. In day-0 brand A and day-15 brands A and C, culturable ECO157 cells were significantly higher on day 10 than on day 5. Microbiome analysis results showed that the relative abundance of Planomicrobium, Aeromonas, Carnobacterium, and Fusobacterium were negatively correlated with the decreasing numbers of culturable ECO157 cells from day 5 to day 10 after inoculation and the relative abundance of genera Methylotenera, Yersinia, Shewanella, Dyadobacter, and Brochothrix were positively correlated with the increasing numbers of culturable ECO157 cells from day 5 to day 10. This study provides in-depth information on the microbiome changes in bagged salad and their impact on food safety, which can assist with the risk assessment of produce products of different shelf life and facilitate the development of new intervention strategies for protecting the microbial safety of fresh produce.

J		Chao Lu; Shuang Qiu; Xueping Wang; Xinyi He; Leping Dang; Zhanzhong Wang							Contrastive analysis of lipid composition and thermal and crystallization behavior of olein/stearin fractionated by novel layer melt crystallization from palm oil.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Melt crystallization is typically recognized as a highly efficient and green method for oil fractionation. This work concentrated on novel layer melt crystallization for preparing desirable olein and stearin products from palm oil and the evaluation of fraction quality. Layer melt crystallization was performed at various temperatures and the effects on fractions were evaluated using iodine value (IV), solid fat content (SFC) and melting point. The lipid composition, thermal and crystallization properties, and phase behaviors of the final optimized fractions were determined using gas chromatography, high-performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry and differential scanning calorimetry. Results. Increasing crystallization tube temperatures under the same jacket temperature increased the melting point and SFC, while decreasing the IV of the olein product. Opposite results were observed for the stearin product. Major fatty acids in fractions were determined as palmitic acid and oleic acid. 1,2-Dioleoyl-3-palmitoylglycerol and 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoylglycerol were identified as the main triacylglycerols in olein and stearin fractions, respectively. A critical effect of crystallization temperature on co-crystallization of oleins and stearins was revealed. A transition from plate-like crystal growth to spherulitic growth with spontaneous nucleation was indicated in palm oil and stearin fractions with increasing crystallization temperature. As for olein fractions, a temperature increase resulted in heterogeneous nucleation from instantaneous nucleation. Conclusions. Novel layer melt crystallization was successfully applied and optimized for fractionating palm oil. The composition and property changes of obtained fractions were analyzed and explained at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	10	4350	4360	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11075					FSTA:2021-10-Ne2307
J		Chao Ma; Yifan Wang; Guocai Zhang; Xianjun Dai							Agar oligosaccharides ameliorate the intestinal inflammation of male Drosophila melanogaster via modulating the microbiota, and immune and cell autophagy.		Food Science & Nutrition					Agar oligosaccharide (AOS) is a marine prebiotic with apparent improving health and longevity effects. In this study, the protective effect of AOS on the intestine was evaluated in the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-induced inflammatory model of male Drosophila. The results showed that AOS used as a nutritional additive in basal food could lengthen the life of SDS-stimulated male Drosophila. Additionally, AOS could alleviate the injuries of SDS to microvilli and mitochondria in male Drosophila midgut epithelial cells. AOS could regulate the relative gene expressions in the antibacterial peptides (AMPs), mTOR pathway and autophagy process, and significantly improved the alpha-diversity of midgut microbiota and decreased the abundance of Klebsiella aerogenes, a kind of bacteria easily causing infections. Collectively, AOS could ameliorate the intestinal inflammation by modulating the microbiota, and the gene expression of immune and cell autophagy. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Chao Ma; Qiaowei Li; Xianjun Dai							Carrageenan oligosaccharides extend life span and health span in male Drosophila melanogaster by modulating antioxidant activity, immunity, and gut microbiota.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Carrageenan oligosaccharide (CAO), the hydrolysate of carrageenan from marine red algae, is used as a prebiotic additive or medical material. In this study, male Drosophila melanogaster was used as an animal model to explore the possibility that CAO can extend the life span through its relationship with antioxidation, immunity, and gut microbiota in vivo. The results show that a certain amount of CAO effectively prolonged the average life span and improved the climbing vitality and fecundity of male Drosophila. In addition, 0.125% CAO in the diet significantly increased the activity of Cu, Zn-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) and catalase (CAT), reduced the content of malondialdehyde (MDA), and significantly repressed the expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) gene in old male Drosophila tissues. In the intestinal microbiota analysis, 0.125% CAO in the diet increased the diversity of gut microbiota and improved the abundance of Commensalibacter at the genus level in Drosophila on the 40th day. The above results indicated that CAO supplementation could extend the life span of male Drosophila by improving antioxidant activity, immunity, and by regulating intestinal microflora.										2021	24	1	101	109	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2019.4663					FSTA:2021-07-Tb2716
J		Chao Mao; Juan Wu; Yu Cheng; Tian Chen; Xiaofeng Ren; Haile Ma							Physicochemical properties and digestive kinetics of whey protein gels filled with potato and whey protein mixture emulsified oil droplets: effect of protein ratios.		Food & Function					Incorporating protein emulsified droplets into protein gels as active fillers have attracted much attention. However, using animal and plant protein mixtures emulsified droplets as the filler is lacking. We investigated the effect of emulsified droplets covered by potato protein (PP) and whey protein (WP) mixtures of different ratios (10/0, 9/1, 7/3, 5/5, 3/7, 1/9, 0/10) on mechanical, microstructural characteristics and digestion of emulsion-filled WP gels (EFWG). The results showed that the particle size of emulsified droplets increased with the enhancement of PP ratio, whereas their zeta-potential value decreased. Increasing the PP ratio improved the elastic moduli (G′), fracture stress and hardness of EFWG, while lowered the water holding capacity and swelling ratios of EFWG. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a higher PP ratio leads to a thicker gel skeleton and fine network. Although the enhancement of the PP ratio decreased disulfide bond content in EFWG, it improved the hydrogen bond and total non-covalent interactions in EFWG. Increased PP in filling emulsions delayed the release rate of the free amino group and free fatty acid during digestion. Moreover, the presence of NaCl improved the gel properties and digestion of EFWG. The findings of this study may provide information for developing new WP gel products with specific digestion rates. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	13	5927	5939	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00653c					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14957
J		Chao Sun; Xiaoqi Gao; Lei Wang; Nan Zhou							Rapid response and high selectivity for reactive nitrogen species based on carbon quantum dots fluorescent probes.		Food Analytical Methods					Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) are vital signaling molecules involved in most physiological and pathological processes. Within RNS, nitric oxide (NO) and its metabolite nitrite (NO2-) have been widely applied in medicinal, food, and environmental fields. However, at present, the methods of detecting RNS by fluorescence quenching through chemical reactions have disadvantages, such as long reaction time and weak anti-interference ability. In response to these existing problems, we have developed a novel fluorescent probe, namely, carbon quantum dots (CDs) that are passivated by benzylamine. The obtained CDs (named B-CDs) possess excellent down-and upconversion properties. In particular, upconversion is used to sensitively and selectively measure NO and NO2- under different pH conditions in aqueous media via two different mechanisms (static and dynamic quenching). At pH 7.4, the nanomolar concentration of NO, produced from sodium nitroprusside (SNP) in a concentration-dependent manner, can be rapidly detected with a correlation coefficient (R2) greater than 0.99. Similarly, the quantitative detection of NO2- at pH 1.6 also shows a good linear relationship with a linear range of 0-14 muM, and a limit of detection (LOD) that is as low as 43 nM and 0.65 muM at excitation wavelengths of 800 nm and 375 nm, respectively. Notably, this probe stands out due to its extremely short response time and outstanding selectivity and anti-interference ability against a variety of common interfering substances, while realizing the fast and highly selective and sensitive detection of NO and NO2-. Finally, this probe has been successfully applied to the sensing of NO in fetal bovine serum (FBS) samples and NO2- in milk and tap water samples. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	6	1121	1132	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-020-01961-7					FSTA:2021-11-Cb3189
J		Chao Tang; Gang Cao; Wen Zhao; Xiaomei Bie; Fengxia Lu; Zhaoxin Lu; Yingjian Lu							Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 improved high-fat diet-induced glucose metabolism disorder independent of promotion of insulin secretion in mice.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					High-fat diet (HFD) contributes to metabolic inflammation and glucose metabolism disorder, thereby resulting in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Accumulating evidence has revealed that some probiotics could improve HFD-induced metabolic inflammation and glucose metabolism disorder. Our previous study has discovered that Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 exhibited in vitro lipid-lowering, antioxidative, and anti-inflammatory activities. This study mainly investigated whether L. acidophilus NX2-6 improved HFD-induced glucose metabolism disorder. The results exhibited that L. acidophilus NX2-6 effectively reduced blood glucose levels and improved glucose tolerance by activating the insulin signaling pathway, promoting glucose uptake, glycolysis, and intestinal gluconeogenesis and suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis, independent of regulation of glycogen synthesis in the liver and muscle. Enhanced insulin sensitivity was associated with L. acidophilus NX2-6-mediated suppression of inflammatory cascades in the target organs. Meanwhile, L. acidophilus NX2-6 also improved hepatic energy metabolism via the FGF21/AMPKalpha/PGC-1alpha/NRF1 pathway. However, L. acidophilus NX2-6 did not affect apoptosis, pyroptosis, inflammation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the pancreas of HFD-fed mice. In conclusion, our results indicated that L. acidophilus NX2-6 improved glucose metabolism disorder through enhancing insulin sensitivity, suppressing metabolic inflammation, and promoting energy expenditure.										2021	69	51	15598	15610	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05948					FSTA:2022-05-Ad7440
J		Chao Tang; Jia Tao; Jing Sun; Fengxia Lv; Zhaoxin Lu; Yingjian Lu							Regulatory mechanisms of energy metabolism and inflammation in oleic acid-treated HepG2 cells from Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 extract.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this study, the cell-free extracts (CFE) of Lactobacillus acidophilus NX2-6 were utilized to treat oleic acid (OA)-induced hepatic steatosis. It was found that CFE treatment improved lipid metabolism in OA-induced hepatic steatosis model by downregulating several lipogenic genes but increasing expression levels of lipolysis-related genes. In addition, gene expression analysis revealed that CFE treatment promoted mitochondrial biogenesis and fission by upregulating the mRNA levels of PGC-1alpha, PGC-1beta, Sirt1, NRF1, and Fis1. CFE treatment also increased protein expression of p-AMPKalpha, PGC-1alpha, ACOX1, and Sirt1 in OA-treated cells, suggesting that CFE possessed ability to improve energy metabolism. Furthermore, CFE treatment also reversed OA-induced oxidative stress by increasing CAT activity and protein level of Nrf-2 as well as reducing protein expression of ATF6, XBP1, GRP78, p50, and p-ERK, indicating that CFE could inhibit endoplasmic reticulum stress and sterile inflammation. Thus, L. acidophilus NX2-6 had potential to fight against NAFLD. Practical applications. Diet-induced hepatic steatosis is one of major public health concerns all over the world. Hepatic steatosis is accompanied by disregulation of lipid metabolism and energy metabolism, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress as well as chronic inflammation. It is reported that probiotics are considered as emerging therapeutic strategy to alleviate hepatic steatosis. This study indicated potential applications of dead probiotics in the prevention of hepatic steatosis and development of functional foods. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13925					FSTA:2022-01-Ad1282
J		Chao Tian; Tianyuan Zhen; Meng Ma; Man Li; Qingjie Sun							Contribution of catechin monomers in tea polyphenols to the structure and physicochemical properties of wheat gluten and its sub-fractions.		Journal of Cereal Science					Wheat gluten with unique viscoelasticity is a key component that affects the quality of wheat products. In this study, the four typical catechin monomers (EGCG, EGC, ECG, EC) on the physicochemical and structural properties of both wheat gluten and its sub-fractions were systematically studied to clarify the dough/gluten enhancing ability of tea polyphenols. It was found that the two ester-type catechin monomers, EGCG and ECG, played a major role in improving gluten strength, which dramatically extended dough stability from 2.9 min to 18.4 and 7.6 min, respectively. Tea polyphenols, EGCG, and ECG monomers induced a more compact network structure for gluten and glutenin-rich fraction, and resulted in a well-organized and ordered network for gliadin-rich fraction. EGC and EC monomers presented no significant effect on the strength and structure of gluten. Tea polyphenols and the monomers can break the-S-S-bonds in glutenin aggregates, and promote their repolymerization during gluten formation. Unlike most gluten-enhancing agents, tea polyphenols improve gluten strength by enhancing hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions, water-solid interaction, and the strong binding between ester-type monomers and proteins, instead of promoting-S-S-bonds formation.

J		Chao Wang; Xing Wang; Guangyao Song; Hanying Xing; Linquan Yang; Kang Han; Yan-Zhong Chang							A high-fructose diet in rats induces systemic iron deficiency and hepatic iron overload by an inflammation mechanism.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) correlates with the high intake of fructose-rich soft drinks. Both inflammation and dysregulated iron metabolism are pathogenic factors in the development of NAFLD. The present investigation assessed the effects of a high-fructose diet (HF diet) on inflammation and iron metabolism. In this study, rats were fed a control or HF diet for 4, 8, or 12 weeks, after which insulin resistance, transaminases levels, serum and liver lipid profiles, inflammatory factors, and iron metabolism-related molecules were evaluated. The activities of the hepatic inflammation-associated pathways, IKKbeta/NF-kappaB, and JAK2/STAT3, were detected by western blot. Result showed that the HF diet-fed animals developed a time-dependent serum lipid increase and hepatic lipid accumulation as well as insulin resistance. Serum iron (SI), serum ferritin (SF), and transferrin saturation (TS) decreased while total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and serum transferrin (s-TF) increased at 8 and 12 weeks in the HF diet group. The HF diet led to increased transaminases levels at 8 and 12 weeks, and iron deposition was observed in the liver, accompanied by an upregulation of ferritin light chain (FTL), hepcidin (HEPC), transferrin (TF), transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1), iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP1), hemojuvelin (HJV), and divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1). Moreover, ferroportin (FPN1) levels were downregulated, as expected from the increased HEPC. A progressive inflammation phenotype was apparent, with increased inflammatory factors, MDA, IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, in the serum and liver tissue. Concomitantly, the hepatic IKKbeta/NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways were activated. In summary, we verified that HF diet induces systemic iron deficiency and hepatic iron accumulation, likely due to the activation of inflammation via the NF-kappaB and JAK2/STAT3 pathways. Practical applications: As increasing numbers of individuals consume HF diets, the health implications of this type of over nutrition become globally relevant. Using a high-fructose diet rat model, our present study reveals inflammation as the link between a HF diet and dysregulated iron metabolism. Importantly, both inflammation and disrupted iron metabolism have been shown to be pathogenic factors in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The iron regulatory hormone, HEPC, is a link between the liver, inflammation, and iron metabolism. As fructose-rich foods become increasingly abundant and people's fructose intake increases, the impact of high fructose on health requires increased attention. Little research has been conducted on the effects of fructose on iron metabolism. Our study provides useful insights into the prevention and treatment of iron metabolism disorders arising from metabolic syndrome. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13578					FSTA:2021-05-Aj8105
J		Chao Xin; Mengya Zhao; Jiahui Wang; Zhenyu Wang							Hawthorn polyphenols, D-chiro-inositol, and epigallocatechin gallate exert a synergistic hypoglycemic effect.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Hawthorn berry has been proved hypoglycemic effect due to the presence of some alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. Herein, screening and identifying of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from hawthorn berry were conducted, and the results showed polyphenols mainly containing quercetin (74.58%) and hyperioside (9.58%) were responsible for its bioactivity. In order to enhance the hypoglycemic effect, the combined glucose-lowering complex (DEH) consisting of hawthorn polyphenols, D-chiro-inositol (DCI), and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was prepared, where three ingredients exerted the synergistic hypoglycemic effect to enhance glucose consumption and glycogen levels and inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis in IR-HepG2 cells. In STZ/HFD-induced mice, DEH effectively improved insulin resistance, reduced fasting blood glucose (FBG) and hepatic gluconeogenesis, and increased hepatic glycogen synthesis and storage via down-regulation of PI3K/Akt/FOXO1-mediated PEPCK and G6Pase and up-regulation of PI3K/Akt/GSK3-mediated GS activation in the liver. In summary, these findings indicate that DEH is a potential novel strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Practical applications. Glucose-lowering complex (DEH) with superior hypoglycemic effect, can effectively improve the insulin resistance, reduce the fasting blood glucose, hepatic gluconeogenesis and increase the hepatic glycogen synthesis and storage in mice, which represents a potential novel strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13771					FSTA:2021-10-Jg13753
J		Chao Xue; Juan You; Huimin Zhang; Shanbai Xiong; Tao Yin; Qilin Huang							Capacity of myofibrillar protein to adsorb characteristic fishy-odor compounds: effects of concentration, temperature, ionic strength, pH and yeast glucan addition.		Food Chemistry					The capacity of myofibrillar protein (MP) to adsorb fishy-odors (hexanal, nonanal, 1-octen-3-ol) was investigated under the influences of concentration, temperature, pH, ionic strength and yeast glucan (YG) addition. The adsorption of MP for fishy-odors was in the order of nonanal > hexanal > 1-octen-3-ol. With increasing MP concentration, the binding of protein-aldehydes was facilitated, in contrast to a decrease trend in binding to 1-octen-3-ol. Meanwhile, MP adsorption capacity for off-odors peaked at 40°C. Additionally, low ionic strength (0.2 mol/L) could promote MP adsorption for off-odors, while high ionic strength (0.6-1.0 mol/L) could reduce its adsorption for hexanal and 1-octen-3-ol. Moreover, MP had higher adsorption capacity under extreme pH values (pH 3 and 11). Furthermore, YG was shown as an ideal additive to adsorb off-odors due to its large specific surface area and good stability. This work provides useful information on how to deodorize fishy-odors in fish products.

J		Chao Yang; Min Li; Bangzhu Peng							Transcriptomic analysis reveals the metabolic mechanism of patulin by Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Patulin is a mycotoxin produced by Penicillium expansum, that exists in apple and cider, and threatens human health and food safety. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) can inhibit and degrade patulin during cider fermentation. Nonetheless, the specific patulin metabolic mechanism is still unclear. Thus, Illumina RNA-Seq technology was applied in this study to analyze the transcriptome of S. cerevisiae cultured in medium with and without patulin, and the gene expression studied. The results showed that the genes encoding redox reactions (OYE3, GTT2, GPX2), cell-to-drug transmembrane transport (HXT, FLR1, YCF1), and responses to biological stress (Yap1, Msn1) were significantly upregulated. S. cerevisiae can respond to the stress of patulin by increasing the activity of related resistant enzymes, such as aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, NADPH dehydrogenase 3, and glutathione S-transferase 2, which leads to effective degradation of patulin. The findings of this study explore the degradation mechanism of patulin and provide potential biomarker genes for detecting patulin in cider.

J		Chao Ye; Dongyi Xu; Jing Chen; Fengqing Hou; Yu Wang; Yuwei Xu; Zheng Zeng; Yuanyi Peng; Dong-Liang Hu; Rendong Fang							Antimicrobial resistance and molecular characterization of class 1 integron in Salmonella isolates recovered from pig farms in Chongqing, China.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Salmonella is considered one of the leading causes for foodborne diseases in humans. Pork and its products contaminated with Salmonella are increasingly recognized as an important source of human salmonellosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial resistance and prevalence of integrons in Salmonella isolates from pig farms. In total, 92 of 724 (12.7%) samples were Salmonella-positive, including 64 (15.0%) from fecal samples, 27 (12.6%) from floor samples, 1 (4.5%) from water samples, and 0 from feed and air samples. These isolates showed the highest resistance to tetracycline (85.9%), followed by trimethoprim (67.4%), ampicillin (60.9%), and chloramphenicol (51.1%). In addition, 51 isolates carried the complete class 1 integron, most of which (42/51) harbored antibiotic resistance cassettes. A total of six gene cassettes including orfF, est-X, dfrA1+aadA1, aadA1, dfrA12+aadA2, and sat were identified, in which the most prevalent one was orfF (29.4%). Furthermore, all 19 class 1 integron-positive isolates harboring dfr genes showed resistance to trimethoprim (SXT), suggesting that the trimethoprim resistance gene (dfr) may contribute to the emergence of SXT resistance phenotype. Therefore, considering the significance of integrons and related resistance genes for public health, special measures should be taken to control Salmonella spp. on the pig farms and to prevent spread of integrons and associated resistance genes.										2021	18	10	712	717	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2881					FSTA:2022-02-Sj0678

Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of cyclodextrins (CDs) on the gelation behavior of kappa-carrageenan/konjac glucomannan (KC/KGM) composite gel were evaluated. The steady shear rheology result showed that the incorporation of CDs reduced the apparent viscosity, yield stress (tau0) and consistency coefficient (K) of KC/KGM composite sol, the shear thinning of the sol was more pronounced. Methyl-beta-CD (M-beta-CD) exerted the greatest effect. The frequency sweep result showed that CDs enhanced the storage modulus of the composite gel and promoted the formation of more flexible gel structures. The improvement of M-beta-CD was more significant than other CDs. Confocal laser scanning microscope images showed that a continuous gel structure formed after the incorporation of alpha-CD, beta-CD or M-beta-CD. While the composite gel containing gamma-CD or HP-beta-CD showed an uneven and discontinuous structure. More hydrogen bond interaction in the gel system formed after the addition of CDs. The presence of CDs strongly contributed to improve the degradation temperature of KC/KGM composite gel and thermal stability.

Food Chemistry					beta-Carotene (BC) exhibits several bioactive properties, but its application is restrained due to the unstability and low biological availability. In this study, protein fibrils were prepared from whey protein isolate fibrils (WPIF), which were used as carriers to protect and deliver BC. With the extension of heating time, the molecular weight of WPI decreased gradually. WPI was hydrolyzed into peptides which self-assembled into WPIF, resulting in significant changes in secondary structure, zeta-potential, viscosity and, antioxidant capacity. The main interactions between WPIF and BC were hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. The encapsulation efficiency of WPIF24 was increased from 76.55% to 92.11% compared to that of untreated WPI. Moreover, the simulated gastrointestinal release showed that the cumulative release of BC encapsulated by WPIF24 reached the maximum in the simulated intestine. Therefore, WPIF could be a potential delivery system for water-insoluble bioactive compounds with enhanced encapsulation efficiency and protection effect.

Foods					International food trade is an integral part of the food system, and the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the fragility of external food supplies. Based on the perspective of cereals trade networks (CTN), the pandemic risk is combined with the trade intensity between countries, and an assessment model of cereals external supply risk is constructed that includes external dependence index (EDI), import concentration, and risk of COVID-19 from import countries index (RICI). The results show that: (1) the global main CTN have typical scale-free characteristics, and seven communities are detected under the influence of the core countries; (2) about 60%, 50%, and 70% of countries face risks of medium and above (high and very high) external dependence, concentration of imports, and COVID-19 in the country of origin, respectively. Under the influence of the pandemic, the risk of global external cereal supply index (RECSI) has increased by 65%, and the USA-CAN communities show the highest risk index; (3) the countries with a very high risk are mainly the Pacific island countries and the Latin American and African countries. In addition, Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and 80% of the net food-importing developing countries are at high or very high RECSI levels. Approximately 50% of countries belong to the compound risk type, and many export countries belong to the RICI risk type; (4) global external food supply is subjected to multiple potential threats such as trade interruption, "price crisis", and "payment dilemma". The geographical proximity of community members and the geographical proximity of the pandemic risk is superimposed, increasing the regional risk of external food supply; and (5) this study confirms that the food-exporting countries should avoid the adoption of food export restriction measures and can prevent potential external supply risks from the dimensions of maintaining global food liquidity and promoting diversification of import sources. We believe that our assessment model of cereals external supply risk comprises a useful method for investigations regarding the international CTN or global food crisis under the background of the pandemic. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chao Zhang; Qinxiu Sun; Qian Chen; Qian Liu; Baohua Kong							Effectiveness of ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing on the thawing rate and physicochemical properties of chicken breast muscle.		Journal of Food Science					This study evaluated the effect of air thawing (AT), water thawing (WT), and ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing (UT) at different power levels (200, 300, 400, and 500 W) on the thawing rate, physicochemical properties, and protein structure of chicken breast muscle (pectoralis), and the weight of each sample was approximately 106 3 g. UT shortened the total thawing time and decreased the cutting force with increasing ultrasound power. Additionally, UT at 300 W (UT-300) remarkably reduced the thawing and cooking losses of the samples compared to AT, WT, and other UT powers (p< 0.05). Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that the T21 and T22 of the UT-300 samples were shorter than those of the AT and WT samples (p< 0.05), which revealed that UT-300 reduced the mobility and losses of both immobilized and free water. Moreover, UT-300 remarkably reduced the damage to the myofibrillar protein (MP) structure. Overall, with appropriate ultrasonic power, the thawing rate increased and changes in the MP structure were reduced. Practical Application. This study found that compared to that of AT samples, the thawing time of the UT-300 samples markedly decreased by 57%. In addition, UT-300 could reduce the damage to the myofibrillar protein structure, which was very beneficial for further processing of frozen foods. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	5	1692	1703	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15699					FSTA:2021-09-Sn5072
J		Chao Zhang; Haotian Liu; Xiufang Xia; Fangda Sun; Baohua Kong							Effect of ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing on emulsifying and gelling properties of chicken myofibrillar protein.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the impact of air thawing (AT), water thawing (WT) and ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing (UT) at different power levels (200, 300, 400, and 500 W) on the emulsifying and gelling properties of the myofibrillar protein (MP). UT at 300 W (UT-300) significantly improved the solubility and the absolute zeta-potential value of MP, reduced the turbidity and the particle size of MP, lowered the loss of gel strength and water holding capacity, and promoted the formation of a stable emulsion (P< 0.05). Compared to the AT and WT samples, the UT-300 MP gels had shorter T21 and T22, which revealed that UT-300 had reduced mobility and losses of the immobilized and free water. The observation of the gel microstructure indicated that the UT-300 samples had compact and homogeneous MP gel network. As a result, appropriate ultrasonic power reduced the losses of the emulsifying properties (emulsifying activity index and the emulsion stability index) and gelling properties (gel water-holding capacity and gel strength) of MP.

Food Chemistry					In this work, an enteric soluble alginate was proposed to improve the absorption efficiency of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) through molecular self-assembly. Under the optimized conditions, the obtained low-viscosity alginate (LVA) was released completely during the simulated gastrointestinal digestion and an LVA-C3G complex with 84.2% binding efficiency was acquired. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy displayed that the characteristic spectrum of C3G had disappeared after the LVA conjugation. Furthermore, based on the analysis of scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, a porous network structure and the shifted endothermic peak in the thermograms were observed, further confirming the formation of a complex between LVA and C3G. The results of simulated gastrointestinal digestion reveal that the LVA assembly significantly (p< 0.05) improved the bioaccessibility of C3G. Correspondingly, the C3G level in mouse plasma was increased by 27.4% in the C3G-LVA group. This suggests the suitability of LVA as an oral delivery vehicle for dietary anthocyanins.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Elucidating the chemical composition and health benefits of specially bred leaf-vegetable sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) can provide a basis for improving their utilization and commercialization and also inform effective breeding strategies. In this study, the nutritional and health-related parameters of different-colored leaf tips (green and purplish-green types) from 11 leafy cultivars of sweet potatoes were determined. The results showed that the tip tissue possessed a wide range of nutritional compounds, and the contents of all of these compounds differed significantly between cultivars (p< 0.001). The crude fibre, crude protein, soluble sugar, and glucose contents ranged between 5.18-10.38, 16.2-30.3, 14.4-22.5, and 2.94-7.91 g/100 g dry weight (dw), respectively. The leaf tips were also good sources of vitamin C (99-511 mg/100 g dw), chlorophyll (892-1797 mg/100 g dw), carotenoids (117-237 mg/100 g dw), free amino acids (479-852 mg/g dw), and minerals (Ca, P, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Se), and the K/Na ratio was particularly high, reaching 384. The leaf tips showed considerable caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) derivatives, particularly the pure green-tipped cultivar GCS-3. Given these nutritional components, GCS-3, GCS-6, and GS-17-23 could be considered as healthy leaf-vegetable cultivars with commercial prospects.

Evaluation of properties in different casings modified by surfactants and lactic acid using terahertz spectroscopy - a feasibility study.		Food Control					The spectra change of sausage hog and sheep casings before and after casing modification in the terahertz range were obtained using a terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) system. Casings were modified by a surfactant solution (composed of soy lecithin and soy oil) and lactic acid, and the water content, swelling ratio and thickness of original and modified casings were determined. THz absorbance spectra of casings were acquired by THz-TDS in the range of 0.5-3.5 THz in attenuated total reflectance (ATR) mode. The absorbances of terahertz spectra for modified hog and sheep casings were greatly higher than that without modification. The THz spectra changes of casings were monitored by THz-TDS using the shift time between low and high frequencies in the ATR system. The drying time under nitrogen gas at 20 L/min flow rate was 31.62 min for natural hog casing. The results demonstrate the potential of THz-TDS to determine aforementioned parameters of original and modified casings as well as other foodstuffs during drying process.

Food & Function					Dietary intake of probiotic yogurt, which has beneficial effects on intestinal microecology, is associated with a lower incidence of hypertension. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the development of hypertension. However, the impact of the gut microbiota in the antihypertensive effect of probiotic yogurt remains unclear. Here, we evaluated the impact of the gut microbiota in the antihypertensive effect of probiotic yogurt in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). SHR were treated with probiotic yogurt (0.2 mL per 100 g body weight) (SHR-Y group) for seven weeks and compared with whole milk-treated (0.2 mL per 100 g body weight) SHR (SHR group) and with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group). The blood pressure and heart function of the rats in the WKY, SHR, and SHR-Y groups were measured. Fecal microbiota was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) gene sequencing. To investigate whether probiotic yogurt prevents hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats through the gut microbiota, we co-housed SHR rats (SHRCOH) with SHR-Y rats (SHRCOH-Y), thus allowing the transfer of microbiota via coprophagy. Compared with whole milk, supplementation of probiotic yogurt significantly reduced the blood pressure, heart rate (HR), and cardiac function. We found that the probiotic yogurt modified the gut microbiota populations and increased the alpha diversity. Gut microbiota remodeling by co-housing partly rescued the increase of blood pressure and impaired the cardiac function of SHR rats. Moreover, probiotic yogurt modulated the gut microbiota in mice by increasing the abundance of short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria and SCFA levels (acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, and valeic acid) in the feces. Together, the presented data revealed that probiotic yogurt exhibited antihypertensive effects in SHR rats via remodeling of the gut microbiota. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	9773	9783	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01836a					FSTA:2022-02-Pl0523

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The emulsification characteristics of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) with different NaCl concentrations also affect the quality of meat products after cooking. We investigated the effects of heating (100 °C) on the solubility, emulsifying activity, and conformational and environmental changes of MPs prepared with different NaCl concentrations. Emulsifying activity increased with increasing NaCl prior to heating, but there was no significant effect after heating. The viscosity increased and particle size decreased with increasing NaCl before heating, but these properties did not change after heating. NaCl did not affect the amount of alpha-helix and beta-sheet. We deduced that the different emulsifying activity of myofibrillar proteins with different NaCl concentrations after heating may have been due to changes in the local environment of MPs. An understanding of the physicochemical and functional properties of MPs would unlock an area for development of meat products at different NaCl and temperature in the food industry. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	6	3016	3025	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14945					FSTA:2021-10-Sj5942

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In the dairy industry, glutamine (Gln) is often used as a feed additive to increase milk yield and quality; however, the molecular regulation underneath needs further clarification. Here, with bovine mammary epithelial cells (BMECs), the effects and mechanisms of Gln on cell growth and casein synthesis were assessed. When Gln was added or depleted from BMECs, both cell growth and beta-casein (CSN2) expression were increased or decreased, respectively. Overexpressing or inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) revealed that Gln regulated cell growth and CSN2 synthesis through the mTORC1 pathway. A similar intervention of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) uncovered that Gln activated the mTORC1 pathway through Arf1. We next observed that both guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Cytohesin-1/2/3 (CYTH1/2/3, CYTHs) and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase activating protein 1 (ARFGAP1), interacted with Arf1. Inhibiting CYTHs or ARFGAP1 showed that Gln supplement or depletion activated or inactivated Arf1 through CYTHs or ARFGAP1, respectively. Collectively, this study demonstrated that Gln positively regulated cell growth and casein synthesis in BMECs, which works through the CYTHs/ARFGAP1-Arf1-mTORC1 pathway. These results greatly enhanced current understanding regarding the regulation of the mTOR pathway and provided new insights for the processes of cell growth and casein synthesis by amino acids, particularly Gln.										2021	69	24	6810	6819	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02223					FSTA:2021-10-Pa5573
J		Chaochao Zhao; Ling Mo; Jingjing Li; Qiuling Deng							Oxidized milk induces spatial learning and memory impairment by altering gut microbiota in offspring mice during pregnancy and lactation.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Early adverse diet exposures are known to be associated with increased risk of learning and memory injury in offspring, yet whether oxidized milk is involved in such an effect has been largely unknown. Here, we focused on oxidized milk intake in mice during pregnancy and lactation to measure the changes in the learning and memory ability in offspring and also probed into the relevant association with gut microbiota. Milk was oxidized with H2O2-Cu or HClO, resulting in different degrees of oxidative damage. KM female mice were fed H2O2-Cu, HClO, or normal control diets immediately after caging until their offspring were 3-weeks old. Behavioral tests were then performed to test the learning and memory ability, and 16S rRNA sequencing was completed with harvested fecal contents. As analyzed, fecal microflora in mice with oxidized milk was affected, mainly reflected in decreased mucin-degrading bacteria, Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, and in reversely increased pro-inflammatory bacteria Shigella, pathobiont Mucispirillum, nervous associated bacteria Ruminococcus,Escherichia, and Desulfovibrio. In the meantime, the inflammation developed in mice was aggravated accompanied by increased expression of relevant genes, while the genes and proteins associated with the learning and memory ability were down-regulated. Further behavioral tests proved impairment of the learning and memory ability in offspring. In general, milk of oxidative damage is a risk factor of the impaired transgenerational ability in learning and memory, which is associated with gut microbiota and intestinal mucosa conditions. This finding may help support the potential of early adverse diet as a harmful factor in learning and memory.										2021	69	34	9934	9946	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02716					FSTA:2022-01-Pe0070

Food Hydrocolloids					Synergistic calcium chloride and microwave heating treatment was applied to improve the rheological properties and printability of a model buckwheat starch-high-methoxy pectin (BP) gel system. Rheological property results suggested that sole microwave heating significantly improved the plasticity, while synergetic treatment significantly decreased the viscosity of the gel. Microwave heating weakened the hydrogen bonding within the gel. On the other hand, synergistic treatment caused an aggregation through cross-linkage between Ca2+ and amide group within the gel; this in turn resulted in the discharge of part of water bound to gel matrix and hence the lower viscosity of the gel. Printing experiments revealed that synergistic pretreatment for 30 s could significantly improve the printing precision of the gel when compared with that of the gel sample steamed for 30 min.

J		Chaofan Guo; Min Zhang; Sakamon Devahastin							Color/aroma changes of 3D-Printed buckwheat dough with yellow flesh peach as triggered by microwave heating of gelatin-gum Arabic complex coacervates.		Food Hydrocolloids					Feasibility of using microwave heating as a stimulus and gelatin-gum Arabic-oil complex coacervates microcapsules as a stimulus-response material to realize color and aroma changes of 3D-printed buckwheat dough containing yellow flesh peach was explored. The morphology of microcapsules prior to printing exhibited a spherical multi-core structure with oil embedded. Addition of different mass fractions of microcapsules increased the storage modulus and loss modulus of the dough, but yielded no significant effect on its viscosity. After 3D printing, the shape of the microcapsules in the dough changed to be fusiform. Upon microwave heating, the microcapsules in the dough were gradually destroyed, with the embedded oil released. Addition of microcapsules increased a* value of the dough, especially upon microwave heating. Contents of (E)-cinnamaldehyde, which is the aroma compound, increased more than 2-fold after 4 min of microwave heating, while the original aroma of yellow flesh peach dough remained unchanged. Addition of 0.5%, 1%, 5% microcapsules could also significantly improve the printing performance. Gelatin-gum Arabic-oil complex coacervates microcapsules could be a potential material to induce color/aroma changes and used in food 3D printing, thus providing another alternative for 4D food printing.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The water state of polysaccharide hydrogel is closely related to its rheological properties, which is the critical parameter determining the printability of 3D printing. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) results showed that T23 (free water) values of polysaccharide hydrogels gradually decreased with increasing concentration, while the viscosity values exhibited a opposite trend. As concentration increased, the printed objects gradually changed from the fluid, which cannot form a shape, to a stable shape and then to a hydrogel of low fluidity that cannot print normally. Hydrogels became hard to extrude smoothly at the piston pressure higher than 428716 Pa. Back propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) nonlinear models established by taking the fingerprint LF-NMR signal as input variables yielded good predicting ability of the piston pressure values (R2adj=0.982) and printing scores (R2adj=0.988). The BP-ANN model based on LF-NMR might be a promising approach to quickly predict the 3D printability of polysaccharide hydrogels. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	5	2264	2272	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14844					FSTA:2021-08-Tb3164

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In recent years, deoxynivalenol (DON) has frequently been detected in wheat grains and their products. The enantioselective impact of flutriafol on the growth and DON biosynthesis of Fusarium graminearum was investigated in relation to water activity (alphaw, 0.97 and 0.99) and temperature (20, 25, and 30°C) on the wheat-based medium. R-(-)-flutriafol exhibited higher bioactivity than S-(+)-flutriafol and Rac-flutriafol under the above conditions. Flutriafol enantiomers reduced or stimulated DON biosynthesis depending on alphaw. DON levels were negligible after 14 or 7 days of incubation times under 0.97 and 0.99 aw, respectively. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses showed that the expression levels of trichothecene biosynthetic (TRI) genes of F. graminearum under 0.97 aw were significantly higher than those under 0.99 aw. In addition, R-(-)-flutriafol can induce more TRI gene expression than S-(+)-flutriafol. Taken together, this study indicated that aw and temperature play important roles in regulating DON biosynthesis in F. graminearum with flutriafol enantiomers.										2021	69	5	1684	1692	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06800					FSTA:2021-06-Mj3403

Food Chemistry					In this study, stable isotopes and multi-element signatures combined with chemometrics were used to distinguish conventional and organic Chinese yams based on field trials. Four light stable isotopes deltaD, delta13C, delta15N, delta18O, and 20 elements (e.g.Li, Na, Mn) were determined, then evaluated using significance analysis and correlation analysis, and modeling of various chemometrics methods. Consequently, the RandomForest model showed the best performance with AUC value of 0.972 and predictive accuracy of 97.3%, and Mn, Cr, Se, Na, deltaD, As, and delta15N were screened as significant variables. Moreover, many chemical components and antioxidant activity of yam samples were determined spectrophotometrically. The results indicated that organic yams had advantages in secondary metabolites such as polyphenol, flavonoid and saponin; conversely, conventional samples had more primary metabolites like protein and amino acids. Above all, this work provides a beneficial case in the authentication and quality evaluation of conventional and organic yams.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The inhibitory activities of banana peel extract against carbohydrate digestive enzymes were investigated. Cycloeucalenone and 31-norcyclolaudenone were obtained by bioassay-guided fractionation as effective inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase. The structure-activity relationships of four triterpenes isolated from banana peel, cycloeucalenone, 31-norcyclolaudenone and cycloeucalenol and its isomer were investigated. The IC50 values of cycloeucalenone and 31-norcyclolaudenone against alpha-glucosidase were 31.832.46 mum and 38.851.54 mum, respectively, and their IC50 values against alpha-amylase were 20.330.59 mum and 27.630.83 mum, respectively. In contrast, cycloeucalenol and its isomer had insufficient inhibitory activity against either enzyme. The primary active sites of cycloeucalenone and 31-norcyclolaudenone are the carbonyl group at C-3 and the double bond in the side chain. Cycloeucalenone induced a parabolic mixed-type inhibition with a Ki value of 73.86 mum in the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory assay.

S.; Oelmueller, R.; Faxing Chen							The effect of the root-colonizing Piriformospora indica on passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) development: initial defense shifts to fitness benefits and higher fruit quality.		Food Chemistry					Passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) has an important economic value as exotic ingredient in juice blends. We inoculated the passion fruit cultivar Passiflora edulis Sims f. edulis's roots with the beneficial root-colonizing fungus Piriformospora indica under greenhouse conditions. The experiments were performed at three different locations and times (between 2017 and 2019). After transient initial growth retardation associated with a mild salicylic-acid (SA)-dependent defense activation and reduced sucrose metabolism, plant performance and growth are promoted during later stages. The elevated SA level in the aerial parts stimulates the plant immune system and promotes pathogen resistance in the adult plants and the fruit peels. P. indica stimulates the fruit size and fruit quality, and the higher amounts of defense-related secondary metabolites in the peels restrict growth of herbivorous insect larvae fed with peel extracts. We conclude that application of P. indica to passion fruits stimulates the plants' immune system and improves the fruits' quality.

J		Chaonan Han; Xiuqin Li; Hui Jiao; Yan Gao; Qinghe Zhang							Accurate determination, matrix effect estimation, and uncertainty evaluation of three sulfonamides in milk by isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.		Journal of Food Quality					Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is the most commonly used method for sulfonamide determination. Its accuracy, however, can be affected by many factors. In this study, sulfadiazine (SDZ), sulfadimidine (SMZ), and sulfadimethoxine (SDM) in milk were selected to investigate an accurate determination method and the potential influencing factors in the use of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Milk samples were extracted by 25mL perchloric acid solution (pH = 2) and cleaned up using HLB solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges. Four kinds of filters, including PTFE, GHP, nylon, and glass fiber, were compared, and PTFE was selected since it had the best recoveries of target sulfonamides (SAs). Three quantitative methods, including external standard (ES), matrix matching (MM), and isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS), were compared, among which IDMS exhibited the best accuracy. The matrix effect under different mobile phase compositions and of different sample matrices were evaluated and discussed. Ion suppression effects were observed during the determination of all SAs, which got stronger with the increase of the methanol composition percent in the mobile phase. After correction by IDMS, the matrix effect could be neglected. Matrix spiked recoveries at three spiked levels (1mug/kg, 10mug/kg, and 20mug/kg) ranged from 96.8% to 103.8% by IDMS. The expanded relative uncertainties were in the range of 2.02% to 5.75%. The method exhibited wide application range, high accuracy, good stability, and high sensitivity.

J		Chaoting Wen; Jixian Zhang; Haihui Zhang; Yuqing Duan; Haile Ma							Study on the structure-activity relationship of watermelon seed antioxidant peptides by using molecular simulations.		Food Chemistry					Our previous studies had shown that watermelon seed antioxidant peptides (WSAPs: P1-P5) possessed good activities. However, the structure-activity relationship of P1 is still unclear. Quantum chemistry and molecular docking were used to investigate the antioxidant mechanism of P1. The active site of P1 is located at C6H14 on Arg. P1 can bind to DPPH/ABTS through hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interaction. Compared with P2-P4, P1 has the strongest antioxidant capacity. The molecular simulation showed that P1 could enhance the stability of Keap1 by interacting with Asn382, Arg380 and Tyr 334 in the active sites. Compared with the model group, the expression of Keap1 was down-regulated (p< 0.05), while the expression of Nrf2 and HO-1 was up-regulated (p< 0.05) after P1 treatment. P1 has the potential ability to activate the signaling pathway Keap1-Nrf2 and improve the antioxidant defense system. This study provides a new perspective for the rational design and mechanism of antioxidant peptides. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Activity assessment of tomato endophytic bacteria bioactive compounds for the postharvest biocontrol of Botrytis cinerea.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Botrytis cinerea is one of the most important postharvest fungal pathogens causing significant losses in fresh fruits, vegetables and ornamentals. Synthetic fungicides are primarily used to control postharvest decay loss, but due to their hazardous use the recent trend is shifting toward safer and more eco-friendly alternatives. The use of antagonistic microorganisms is becoming popular throughout the world. This study investigated the antifungal, the plant growth promoting activities and the identity of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) produced by tomato-derived endophytic bacteria strains. The capacity of selected strains to prevent postharvest B. cinerea infection on tomato fruit through VOCs and soluble compounds was also studied. A collection of 50 bacterial strains was established from different organs of tomato plants sampled from six localities in Cape Bon region (Tunisia). Despite the small geographical scale, complexity and abundance of endophytic communities varied greatly according to the site of origin. Healthy tomato plants harbor diverse endophytic bacteria of Bacillus and Enterobacter genera colonizing mainly leaves with a significant enrichment with Bacillus strains. The in vitro dual culture assays showed that 36% of the endophytic bacterial strains produce antifungal VOCs against B. cinerea. To our knowledge, this is the first report of VOCs antifungal activity produced by B. Nakamurai, B. pseudomycoides, B. proteolyticus, B. thuringiensis, E. asburiae and E. cloacae against B. cinerea. About 14% of bacterial strains produce VOCs with in vitro specific promoting effects on tomato seedling length or biomass production. The five selected antagonistic endophytic bacterial strains produced a core set of seven VOCs along with different strain-specific and known antifungal VOCs such as 3-Methylbutan-1-ol, sulfur-containing compounds, 2-Heptanone and Dodecanal. Tomato fruit bio-protection assay showed that the Enterobacter strain TR1 produces the most protective VOCs against B. cinerea infection with 3-Methylbutan-1-ol as a major volatile compound which totally suppressed B. cinerea growth and infection on tomato fruit at 0.442 mL L-1 headspace, whereas the Bacillus strains showed better protection against fungal infection when applied as vegetative cells on tomato fruit. These results support the use of the selected strains as potential biocontrol agents to reduce postharvest decay of B. cinerea, as well as 3-Methylbutan-1-ol as promising antifungal volatile to apply during postharvest commercialization of tomato fruit.

Foods					Fermented tea (Cha-miang in Thai) is a local product made by traditional food preservation processes in Northern Thailand that involve steaming fresh tea leaves followed by fermenting in the dark. Information on changes in nutritive values, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activities, and health properties that occur during the steaming and fermenting processes of tea leaves is, however, limited. Changes in nutritive values, phenolics, antioxidant activities, and in vitro health properties through inhibition of key enzymes that control obesity (lipase), diabetes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase), hypertension (angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)), and Alzheimer's disease (cholinesterases (ChEs) and beta-secretase (BACE-1)) of fermented tea were compared to the corresponding fresh and steamed tea leaves. Results showed that energy, carbohydrate, and vitamin B1 increased after steaming, while most nutrients including protein, dietary fiber, vitamins (B2, B3, and C), and minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, and Zn) decreased after the steaming process. After fermentation, energy, fat, sodium, potassium, and iron contents increased, while calcium and vitamins (B1, B2, B3, and C) decreased compared to steamed tea leaves. However, the contents of vitamin B1 and iron were insignificantly different between fresh and fermented tea leaves. Five flavonoids (quercetin, kaempferol, cyanidin, myricetin, and apigenin) and three phenolic acids (gallic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid) were identified in the tea samples. Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activities increased significantly after steaming and fermentation, suggesting structural changes in bioactive compounds during these processes. Steamed tea exhibited high inhibition against lipase, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase, while fermented tea possessed high anti-ChE and anti-ACE activities. Fresh tea exhibited high BACE-1 inhibitory activity. Results. Suggest that tea preparations (steaming and fermentation) play a significant role in the amounts of nutrients and bioactive compounds, which, in turn, affect the in vitro health properties. Knowledge gained from this research will support future investigations on in vivo health properties of fermented tea, as well as promote future food development of fermented tea as a healthy food. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chaoyi Shen; Jingshan Rao; Qingyan Wu; Di Wu; Kunsong Chen							The effect of indirect plasma-processed air pretreatment on the microbial loads, decay, and metabolites of Chinese bayberries.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Chinese bayberries are nutritious and have a unique flavor. However, they are prone to mechanical damage after harvest, which leads to increments of microbial growth on the surface, promoting fruit decay and causing potential health hazards. This study evaluated the decontamination effects of plasma-processed air (PPA) on natural occurring microbiota (Test I) and inoculated Penicillium citrinum (Test II) of both intact and mechanically damaged Chinese bayberries over three days of storage at 20 °C. In addition, the effects of PPA pre-treatment on metabolites of Chinese bayberries were investigated. In Test I, the results show that, for the intact fruits, compared to the control, the PPA pretreatment reduced the decay index, fungi populations, and bacteria populations by 19.72%, 1.69, and 1.15 log CFU/g at the end of storage, respectively, whereas, for fruits with compression damage, those values were 11.92%, 1.23, and 1.33 log CFU/g, respectively. In Test II, the results show that PPA inhibited the mycelial growth of Penicillium citrinum and reduced the decay indices. The results of metabonomics analysis show that PPA pretreatment caused oxidative stress of Chinese bayberries, increasing the contents of antioxidative compounds and enhancing the antioxidant activity of Chinese bayberries.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (ZBM), a special spice from Chinese different areas, have a widespread variation in quality and price. To avoid the commercial adulteration of ZBM, it is necessary to discriminate them from different areas. As volatile aroma compounds (VAC) have the potential to discriminate ZBM, electronic nose (E-nose) was used to preliminarily discriminate the VAC through sensor response analysis, radar chart analysis, and principal component analysis. Then, Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to identify VAC through hierarchical cluster analysis and quantitative analysis. Finally, artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to assess the accuracy of the discrimination of ZBM. As a result, we found that ZBM could be successfully discriminated between Chinese Sichuan and the other areas. Our findings would provide guidance for evaluating and predicting the variation of VAC of ZBM from different areas in further study. Practical applications. Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (ZBM) is a traditional and important spice used in Sichuan cuisine especially hotpot, which are famous all over overseas. However, the ZBM from different producing areas bring various flavors, hampering the quality of Sichuan cuisine developing toward to standardization. Therefore, the authors in this work pursuit an effective way to distinguish the ZBM produced in Sichuan rather than in other province. According to the results of the present study, ZBM could be successfully discriminated between Chinese Sichuan and the other producing areas by using E-nose and GC-MS through artificial neural network. These findings would provide the guidance for evaluating the producing areas of ZBM to be whether or not Sichuan, which could offer the practical help in the purchase of the raw material in the supply chain. Besides, these also can be applied to predict the variation of volatile aroma compounds of the ZBM in the further study. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13621					FSTA:2021-06-Te2268

Food Chemistry					Oleofoams have emerged as attractive low-calorie aeration systems, but saturated lipids or large amount of surfactants are commonly required. Herein, an innovative strategy was proposed to create oleofoams using medium-long chain diacylglycerol (MLCD) and beta-sitosterol (St). The oleofoams prepared using MLCD and St in ratios of 15:5 and 12:8 exhibited smaller bubble size and much higher stability. MLCD crystals formed rigid Pickering shell, whereby air bubbles acted as "active fillers" leading to enhanced rigidity. Both Pickering and network stabilization for the MLCD-St oleofoam provided a steric hindrance against coalescence. The gelators interacted via hydrogen bonding, causing a condensing effect in improving the gel elasticity. The oleofoams and foam-based emulsions exhibited a favorable capacity in controlling volatile release where the maximum headspace concentrations and partition coefficients showed a significantly decrease. Overall, the oleofoams have shown great potential for development of low-calorie foods and delivery systems with enhanced textural and nutritional features.

Connection between miRNA mediation and the bioactive effects of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica): exogenous miRNA resistance to food processing and GI digestion.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. Italica) and its bioactive compounds are associated with beneficial health effects, which might be enabled, at least in part, through miRNA regulation, despite recent controversial studies suggesting that exogenous dietary miRNAs may reach host circulation and target cells to regulate gene expression. Here, a computational analysis was performed to explore the processes and pathways associated with genes targeted either by (1) host-expressed miRNAs (endogenous) modulated by the bioactive compounds in broccoli or (2) miRNAs derived from broccoli (exogenous). In addition, the stability of exogenous miRNAs from broccoli was assessed after broccoli was subjected to the usual processing methods and in vitro digestion-simulating gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Overall, bioinformatic results show that the anticarcinogenic and cancer-preventive properties attributed to cruciferous vegetables might be mediated, at least in part, through miRNA-related mechanisms. Moreover, results show that broccoli-derived miRNAs can survive common food-processing conditions and GI digestion.

Role of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in mediating the effects of coffee in the colon.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. This study investigates the mechanism of action and functional effects of coffee extracts in colonic cells, on intestinal stem cell growth, and inhibition of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced intestinal barrier damage in mice. Methods and Results. Aqueous coffee extracts induced Ah receptor (AhR)-responsive CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and UGT1A1 gene expression in colon-derived Caco2 and YAMC cells. Tissue-specific AhR knockout (AhRf/f x Lgr5-GFP-CreERT2 x Villin-Cre), wild-type (Lgr5-CreERT2 x Villin-Cre) mice are sources of stem cell enriched organoids and both coffee extracts and norharman, an AhR-active component of these extracts inhibited stem cell growth. Coffee extracts also inhibit DSS-induced damage to intestinal barrier function and DSS-induced mucosal inflammatory genes such as IL-6 and TGF-beta1 in wild-type (AhR+/+) but not AhR-/- mice. In contrast, coffee does not exhibit protective effects in intestinal-specific AhR knockout mice. Coffee extracts also enhanced overall formation of AhR-active microbial metabolites. Conclusions. In colon-derived cells and in the mouse intestine, coffee induced several AhR-dependent responses including gene expression, inhibition of intestinal stem cell-enriched organoid growth, and inhibition of DSS-induced intestinal barrier damage. We conclude that the anti-inflammatory effects of coffee in the intestine are due, in part, to activation of AhR signaling. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	20			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100539					FSTA:2022-02-Hn1145

The method for direct gas chromatographic determination of acetaldehyde, methanol, and other volatiles using ethanol as a reference substance: application for a wide range of alcoholic beverages.		Food Analytical Methods					The article presents the results of collaborative study of the method for gas chromatographic determination of alcoholic fermentation volatile by-products (acetaldehyde, methanol, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propan-2-ol, propan-1-ol, 2-methylpropan-1-ol, butan-1-ol, and 3-methylbutan-1-ol) in alcoholic beverages with volume ethanol content in a range of 9.9-96.0% (wine, sake, liquor, tequila, vodka, grappa, bourbon, scotch, calvados, rakia, rum, brandy, whiskey, gin, and rectified ethyl alcohol). The zest of the method is the use of ethanol, present in beverages, as a reference substance for quantitative determination of mentioned components. Checking of precision data, obtained under repeatability conditions and under both repeatability and intermediate precision conditions, and trueness of test results, was carried out according to the ISO 5725-6. The relative difference between calibration coefficients (relative response factors for analyzed volatile compound relative to ethanol), obtained with an interval of 3 weeks, did not exceed 1.1%. Contents of acetaldehyde, methanol, and volatiles in 15 commercial alcoholic beverages analyzed by the developed method varied in the 1.84-677 mg L-1 of absolute ethanol, 3.25-12,394 mg L-1 of absolute ethanol, and 1.49-4243 mg L-1 of absolute ethanol intervals, correspondingly. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

International Sugar Journal					Ion exchange and activated carbon are the major technologies used for sugar decolorization in refineries. Ion exchange is generally preferred as it requires lower capital investment and it offers higher decolorization performance in a robust and reliable manner. Improvements in raw sugar quality, and particularly reduction in color, raised multiple opportunities to upgrade existing resin decolorization systems to these new conditions. Two different cases of modernization are presented, resulting in increasing plant capacity for the same amount of installed resin, improving flexibility to multiple production conditions, decreasing water and regeneration brine to lowest levels, while keeping operating costs minimal. A detailed description of the performances before-and-after modernization is presented, as well as the appropriate strategy, to ensure investment low and to shorten the production stop during implementation.

Development of a new nanocarrier for dietary garcinol: characterization and in vitro efficacy evaluation using breast cancer stem cells grown in hypoxia.		Journal of Food Quality					Garcinol (GA), a polyisoprenylated benzophenone derivative, is one of the major phytochemicals found in a number of fruits of Garcinia. This study aimed to develop a new nanodelivery system comprising GA, hyaluronic acid (HA), and poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) to actively target breast cancer stem cells (bCSCs) grown under hypoxic conditions. HA has been reported to show higher affinity for the cluster-determinant 44 receptor (CD44), while PLGA is an FDA-approved biodegradable polymer used in clinical applications. Nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared by emulsion solvent diffusion technique using DMAB as the emulsifier. Following preparation, particle size, surface charge, and polydispersity index of NPs were characterized. Antiproliferative effects of NPs were assessed by the WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Apoptotic effects of NPs were evaluated by the caspase-3/7 assay. Effects of prepared NPs on the expression of genes related to hypoxia-inducing factors (HIF-1alpha and HIF-2alpha) and notch ligands (DLL1 and Jagged1) were evaluated using real-time PCR. HA-coated garcinol-loaded NPs (HA-GA-NPs) showed greater antiproliferative effects in bCSCs grown under hypoxia. Moreover, HA-GA-NPs showed an improved cellular uptake via receptor-mediated endocytosis compared to non-HA-coated GA-NPs. Exposure to GA-HA-NPs resulted in a significant downregulation in hypoxia-inducing factors and notch pathway-related genes. Activation of caspase-3/7 confirmed the HA-GA-NPs can induce apoptosis in bCSCs. Overall findings of the study confirm that HA-GA-NPs can be considered as an effective nanodelivery system to target bCSCs grown under the hypoxic microenvironment.

A Alamsjah							Characterization of freeze-dried microencapsulation tuna fish oil with arrowroot starch and maltodextrin.		Food Hydrocolloids					Arrowroot starch (AS), extracted from a tropical rhizome (Maranta arundinacea), was investigated and compared to maltodextrin (MD) in whey protein (WP) combinations for its potential as a novel wall material to microencapsulate and limit oxidative rancidity of tuna fish oil. Tuna fish oil was mixed into six emulsions composed of 5:1, MD: WP (P1); 6.5:1, MD: WP (P2); 5:1, AS: WP (P3); 6.5:1, AS: WP (P4); 3.344:1.668:1, MD: AS: WP (P5); and 3.25:3.25:1, MD: AS: WP (P6) to produce microcapsules by freeze drying. The microcapsules were studied for encapsulation efficiency (EE), moisture content, water activity, peroxide value (PV), acid value (AV), microstructure, and the degree of primary oxidation was evaluated every 15 days for 90 days at 25 °C. The fish oil microcapsules demonstrated high EE (80.5-86.4%), low moisture content (0.24-3.47%), and low water activity (0.05-0.23). The microcapsules exhibited PV (4.80-9.20 mEq/kg oil) and AV (1.46-2.24%FFA) values that remained below industry-set maximum limits of PV (10 mEq O2/kg oil) and AV (<3) for refined fish oil. Particle size of the freeze-dried microcapsules ranged 26.72-103.14 mum with irregular to smooth surfaces. Microcapsules of MD: AS: WP (P6) combination exhibited the highest oxidation stability during the 90-day storage test. The results demonstrated that arrowroot starch: maltodextrin combinations successfully encapsulated tuna fish oil, improved shelf life, and demonstrated oxidative stability. Moreover, arrowroot starch behaved as a cryoprotectant during freeze-drying, and as wall material in tuna fish oil microencapsulation indicated its microencapsulation carrier and application potential in food fortification.

The activity in S. comorensis ranged between 56.28 0.02 and 44.22 0.03 for fruit samples from Coast region and between 61.77 0.00 and 51.8 0.1 for fruit samples from Tanga. However, the differences in antioxidant activity between fruits from the two regions were not significant (P> .05) as they performed on the same latitudinal gradient influenced by the similar coastal habitat conditions. Data indicated a positive correlation between concentration of the fruit extracts and the free radical scavenging capacity where higher antioxidant activity was observed at 1000 g/ml fruit extract concentration than in 62.5 g/ml. The regression analysis indicated significant influence of the wild fruit extracts on antioxidant activity in fruit samples from Tanga than it was in fruit samples from Coast regions. The considerable antioxidant activity depicted by the fruits of both V. doniana and S. comorensis indicated their neutraceutical potential as natural antioxidants. © 2021 Dominic Charles and Clarence Mgina.

J		Charlesworth, J.; Mullan, B.; Moran, A.							Investigating the predictors of safe food handling among parents of young children in the USA.		Food Control					Foodborne illness, or food poisoning, is a global health issue, affecting over 600 million people each year. Contrary to lay beliefs, the majority of food poisoning occurs as a result of improperly handling food within the home. The past decade has seen an increase in research using theoretical frameworks to investigate predictors of safe food handling, however, this research has been hampered by a focus on motivational models of behaviour and the conceptualisation of safe food handling as a unitary behaviour. Additionally, little research has investigated safe food handling in relation to a particularly susceptible group: young children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a dual process theory to explore the predictors of four safe food handling behaviours among parents of young children. One-hundred and thirty-six participants, recruited via CloudResearch, completed self-report measures of intention, habit, self-control, self-efficacy and safe food handling knowledge, and, one week later, completed self-report measures of their engagement in safe food handling behaviours. Results of logistic regression analyses revealed that intention, self-control and self-efficacy significantly predicted cleaning hands and surfaces before preparing food, and knowledge significantly predicted cooking food properly and storing raw and cooked food separately. These findings suggest that there is no one consistently significant predictor of all four safe food handling behaviours, however, knowledge did appear to be an important influence on safe food handling behaviours less familiar to consumers over and above other known predictors for safe food handling behaviours. Educational interventions should focus on increasing safe food handling knowledge for less familiar safe food handling behaviours whereas self-control interventions may be more beneficial for increasing more familiar behaviours such as cleaning hands and surfaces before preparing food.

Evaluating the impact of a pilot safe food-handling media campaign among consumers in Western Australia: implications for public health messaging.		Food Control					Over 4.1 million Australians are affected by food poisoning each year. Recent reports indicate that food poisoning is increasing, particularly in Queensland and Western Australia. Foodborne illness is preventable through simple household behaviours such as cleaning hands and surfaces when preparing food, separating raw and ready-to-eat foods, cooking food thoroughly, and keeping food at the correct temperature. Several interventions have been developed to raise awareness of these safe food-handling practices; however, the efficacy of large scale interventions has not been evaluated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of a pilot safe food-handling media campaign that aimed to increase consumer safe food-handling knowledge and behaviour. Five-hundred and forty-six participants completed measures of safe food-handling knowledge and behaviour prior to and following a pilot safe food-handling media campaign that ran for four months in The City of Busselton, Western Australia. A generalised linear mixed model analysis revealed that the pilot media campaign had an effect on consumer engagement in half of the target safe food-handling behaviours. The pilot safe food-handling media campaign also had a statistically significant effect (albeit not clinically significant) on consumer safe food-handling knowledge in the opposite direction to that hypothesised. Findings are discussed in relation to the implications for the design and implementation of future public health messages related to safe food-handling.

Assessing levels of traditionality and naturalness depicted on labels of fermented meat products in the retail: exploring relations with price, quality and branding strategy.		Meat Science					Food labelling is a tool to inform consumers about the specifications and characteristics of a product. Additionally, labels display information about traditionality and naturalness, of which the meaning is highly subjective. There is a paucity of research examining attributes both of tradition and naturalness. In this study, traditionality was assessed by a model that included temporal, geographical, know-how, and cultural components. Naturalness was evaluated based on bio/organic elements, "free-from" claims, and natural ingredients. Therefore, a content analysis tool was developed to analyze and score labels of fermented meat products, which generated insights in the key label characteristics of tradition and naturalness. The degree of tradition and naturalness was the average of their subdimensions which were scored based on the displayed elements. A higher degree of tradition and naturalness was linked to higher prices. Fermented meat labels were found to be strongly embedded in "authenticity", and less in naturalness, an element more attractive for private labels than for branded products.

Citral effects on the expression profile of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and inflammatory cytokines in status epilepticus-induced rats using the lithium-pilocarpine model.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. About one-third of people with epilepsy are refractory to available treatments. Studies suggest that mechanisms linked to the immune response and inflammatory process are related to seizure disorders. Citral is a monoterpene found in the essential oil of several plants, as in Cymbopogon citratus, used to make teas and has been the subject of numerous researches, from which it has been possible to demonstrate antiseizure and anti-inflammatory activities. In this study, the effects of citral on status epilepticus (SE) induced by the lithium-pilocarpine model in rats were investigated. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) evaluated latency for seizure development, neuronal death in the hippocampus, and expression of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) and factor nuclear kappa B (NF-kappaB) genes. The results revealed that citral was able to increase latency until the first seizure, decrease neuronal death 2h after SE and inhibit overexpression of proinflammatory genes.

In vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activities with polyphenolic profiling of wild cherry, the European larch and sweet chestnut tree bark.		European Food Research and Technology					This study is a comparative investigation of antioxidant and antibacterial properties of tree bark extracts of three common European species, Prunus avium L., Larix decidua Mill. and Castanea sativa Mill. The bioactive compounds present in the bark were recovered in 80% aqueous ethanol using ultrasound as the green extraction method. The antioxidant potential of the extracts was assessed with multiple biochemical assays: total phenol content (TPC) expressed in gallic acid equivalent (GAE), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) expressed in trolox equivalent (TE), and ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) expressed in ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE). Sweet chestnut bark extract showed the highest antioxidant activity with TPC of 174.25 16.95 mg GAE/g dry weight, DPPH (IC50) of 2.69 0.03 mug/mL, ABTS of 739.65 24.41 mg TE/g dry weight and FRAP of 207.49 3.62 mg AAE/g dry weight. The antibacterial activity of the extracts was evaluated by disk diffusion test, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assay and bacterial growth curves. Sweet chestnut bark extract gave IC50 values of 0.25 mg/mL and 1.00 mg/mL against E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. The polyphenolic profiling of the bark extracts was performed to identify the major compounds responsible for the bioactivities using high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The bark extracts were rich in natural antioxidants, thus holding tremendous potential for use as natural additives in food industry. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	247	9	2355	2370	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03796-w					FSTA:2021-12-Jb16042
J		Chasiotis, V.; Fatemeh Nadi; Filios, A.							Evaluation of multilayer perceptron neural networks and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems for the mass transfer modeling of Echium amoenum Fisch. & C. A. Mey.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Multilayer perceptron (MLP) feed-forward artificial neural networks (ANN) and first-order Takagi-Sugeno-type adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS) are utilized to model the fluidized bed-drying process of Echium amoenum Fisch. & C. A. Mey. The moisture ratio evolution is calculated based on the drying temperature, airflow velocity and process time. Different ANN topologies are examined by evaluating the number of neurons (3 to 20), the activation functions and the addition of a second hidden layer. Different numbers (2 to 5) and shapes of membership functions are examined for the ANFIS, using the grid partitioning method. The models with the best performance in terms of prediction accuracy, as evaluated by the statistical indices, are compared with the best fit thin-layer model and the available data from the experimental cases of 40 °C, 50 °C and 60 °C temperatures at 0.5,0.75 and 1 ms-1 airflow velocity. Results. The best performed ANFIS model, comprised by 5-2-2 of pi-shaped andtriangular membership functions for time, temperature and airflow velocityinputs respectively, was able to describe the moisture ratio evolution of E. amoenum more precisely than the best ANN topology, achieving higher values of coefficientof determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and sum of squared errors (SSE). The best thin-layer model involving six adjustable parameters, managedto describe experimental data most accurately with R2=0.9996, RMSE=0.0057and SSE=7.3.10-4. Conclusion. The results of the comparative study indicate that empirical regression models with increased numbers of adjustable parameters, constitute a simpler and more accurate modeling approach for estimating the moisture ratio of E. amoenum Fisch. & C.

Vitamin A and D absorption in adults with metabolic syndrome versus healthy controls: a pilot study utilizing targeted and untargeted LC-MS lipidomics.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Persons with metabolic syndrome (MetS) absorb less vitamin E than healthy controls. It is hypothesized that absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) A and D2 would also decrease with MetS status and that trends would be reflected in lipidomic responses between groups. Methods and Results. Following soymilk consumption (501 IU vitamin A, 119 IU vitamin D2), the triglyceride-rich lipoprotein fractions (TRL) from MetS and healthy subjects (n=10 age-and gender-matched subjects/group) are assessed using LC-MS/MS. Absorption is calculated using area under the time-concentration curves (AUC) from samples collected at 0, 3, and 6 h post-ingestion. MetS subjects have 6.4-fold higher median vitamin A AUC (retinyl palmitate) versus healthy controls (P=0.07). Vitamin D2 AUC is unaffected by MetS status (P=0.48). Untargeted LC-MS lipidomics reveals six phospholipids and one cholesterol ester with concentrations correlating (r=0.53-0.68; P< 0.001) with vitamin A concentration. Conclusions. The vitamin A-phospholipid association suggests increased hydrolysis by PLB, PLRP2, and/or PLA2IB may be involved in the trend in higher vitamin A bioavailability in MetS subjects. Previously observed differences in circulating levels of these vitamins are likely not due to absorption. Alternate strategies should be investigated to improve FSV status in MetS. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Seneviratne							Effect of chain length and saturation of the fatty acids in dietary triglycerides on lipid metabolism in Wistar rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					We investigated the effect of the chain length and the degree of saturation of fatty acids in dietary triglycerides on serum lipid profiles and hepatic lipid metabolism in Wistar rats. Fat component of the basal diet (soybean oil) was replaced with fats with fatty acids of different chain lengths and saturation and the serum lipids were monitored for 150 days. Principal component (PC) analysis of serum lipid components was related to chain length and saturation. The combined effect of chain length and saturation on PC 1 scores was evaluated by multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that average chain length of the fatty acids of triglycerides has a higher influence on the quality of serum lipid parameters than the average degree of saturation. Expression of selected genes responsible for lipid metabolism showed similar trends in medium chain saturated and long chain polyunsaturated diet groups. Practical applications. Dietary lipids contain a wide range of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with different chain lengths. Overall contribution of these different fatty acids decides the health effects of the lipids in the diet. Present study shows that the fats with medium chains and higher degree of saturation and fats with long chains and higher degree of unsaturation (lower degree of saturation) affect serum lipid parameters and expression of hepatic genes involved in the lipid metabolism in a similar manner. Such information is important for physicians to plan dietary schemes to improve the nutritional health and manage the noncommunicable diseases. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13664					FSTA:2021-08-Aj12113

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Effects of glycerol on the heat-moisture treatment (HMT) of A-type rice and cassava starches and B-type potato and canna starches were investigated. Starch samples were soaked in water or glycerol solution, adjusted to 25% moisture, and then subjected to HMT at 100°C for 1,6, and 16 h. Pasting profiles of all four starches plasticised with water clearly showed the B-type potato and canna starches were more susceptible to HMT than the A-type rice and cassava starches. The effect of HMT on the pasting properties of glycerol-plasticised samples was inconclusive; the B-type canna and A-type cassava starches were altered, but not the B-type potato and A-type rice starches, which remained comparable to the water-plasticised samples. Thus, the type of plasticiser as well as the environment surrounding the crystalline region, which is specific to each starch type, also affect the alteration of starch during HMT. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOS) are associated with health benefits for newborns. We studied the composition of goat MOS (gMOS) from colostrum up to the 9th month of lactation to conceive an overview of the structures present and their fate. Potential correlations with factors such as age, parity, and lifetime milk production were examined. An effective method for gMOS extraction and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD) analysis was established, following 2-aminobenzamide gMOS labeling. Considerable biological variability was highlighted among the 12 quantified gMOS and the 9 non-quantified structures in the individual milk samples. Most characteristic, 2′-fucosyllactose was present in 73.7% of the milk samples analyzed, suggesting the possibility of a secretor/non-secretor goat genotype, similar to humans. Contributing factors to the observed biological variability were goat age, parity, lifetime milk production, and the kids' sex. The results significantly contribute to the current understanding of (variations in) gMOS composition.		van Leeuwen, Sander/C-7140-2012	van Leeuwen, Sander/0000-0003-0017-2841; Dijkhuizen, Lubbert/0000-0003-2312-7162; Chatziioannou, Anastasia Chrysovalantou/0000-0002-1973-7542							2021	69	28	7851	7862	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00499					FSTA:2021-11-Pe6216

Native and modified chayotextle flour effect on functional property and cooking quality of spaghetti.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The objective of this research was to study the effect of partially substituting semolina flour by native (NCHF) and modified chayotextle (CHFMD) flours, on the physicochemical properties and cooking quality of spaghetti. Spaghetti was obtained by replacing semolina flour (control) with five different concentrations of NCHF and CHFMD flours (10%, 17.5%, 25%, 32.5% and 40%). The proximal composition of the flours showed that both NCHF and CHFMD flours lower content of protein and fat but higher content of ash and resistant starch (RS). Moreover, the RS content increased due to thermal modification (TM) and that RS remained high, even after the cooking process. Pasting properties such as peak viscosity, breakdown, setback and final viscosity were influenced by NCHF and CHFMD concentrations. Brightness (Delta L*) was significantly reduced by inclusion of increasing CHFMD levels. True density and water absorption values increased with addition of NCHF and CHFMD, compared to the control spaghetti. The results obtained in this study demonstrated the possibility for producing spaghetti containing up to 40% CHFMD flour, with acceptable quality and functional properties. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Chaves, M. A.; Pinho, S. C.							Influence of phospholipid saturation on the physicochemical characteristics of curcumin/vitamin D3 co-loaded proliposomes obtained by the micronized sucrose coating process.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of different ratios of food-grade saturated and unsaturated soy phospholipids on the production of proliposomes with curcumin and vitamin D3 were studied. A micronized sucrose-coating process was employed to obtain the proliposomes. The phospholipid ratio had a minor influence on their physicochemical parameters, as low values for water activity (Aw≤0.26), moisture content (Xw≤2.97%), hygroscopicity (≤8.62 g adsorbed water/100 g dry matter), and intermediate values for solubility (≤44.8% of solubilized powder) were obtained. Also, Fourier transform infrared and X-ray powder diffraction results revealed an improvement in their amorphous structure due to sucrose. The entrapment efficiency values for curcumin and vitamin D3 were up to 100% and 98.7%, respectively, after 60 days. Additionally, the nanoliposomes resulting from the hydration of proliposomes exhibited sizes lower than 400 nm. The results shown herein are relevant to the production of lower-cost synergistic carriers with high bioactive retention using an abundant raw material such as sucrose. Novelty impact statement. Purified phospholipids are commonly used in the production of liposomes, but their high cost may be a limiting factor for their large-scale production. Non-purified phospholipids can be up to 20% cheaper. The production of proliposomes containing different ratios of phospholipids with different degrees of saturation has never been explored for the coencapsulation of curcumin and vitamin D3, two hydrophobic molecules with well-known biological activities. The micronized sucrose coating process allows the production of a cheaper and easily reproducible food-grade carrier with high bioactive retentions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Physicochemical properties, characteristics, and consumer acceptance of whole grain sorghum expanded extrudates.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The objective of this work was to study how six sorghum genotypes affected the production of whole grain expanded snacks using extrusion cooking and to evaluate their physicochemical properties, sensory characteristics, and consumer acceptance. The chemical composition and antioxidant capacity of raw flours from whole grains were evaluated. Sectional expansion index, paste viscosity, and texture (hardness and crispness) analyses as well as acceptance tests and check-all-that-apply questions were conducted on the extrudates. White pericarp sorghum extrudates presented the highest sectional expansion and sensory acceptance, and were negatively correlated to total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity. Sorghums with tannins had the highest antioxidant capacity but the lowest values of sensory acceptance. The combination of different sorghum genotypes could be used to produce a final product with good antioxidant capacity and acceptability. Practical applications. Sorghum is the fifth most produced cereals in the world largely used for animal feed but limited in direct human consumption. It is known that it has interesting agricultural characteristics such as drought and heat resistant and also contain expressive content of bioactives linked with health benefits. As an example, tannin sorghum has the greatest values of antioxidant activity when compared with other cereals, but it was demonstrated by our work that it has low sensory acceptance; on the other hand, nontannin sorghum showed higher acceptability. By understanding the technological aspects and sensory differences of sorghum genotypes processed by extrusion cooking allow the development of sorghum ready-to-eat blend products (tannin and nontannin sorghum) with the best of both antioxidant capacity and sensory acceptance. Our results could be used by the food industry to develop novel products with improved technological and sensory characteristics that could be introduced as functional healthy food options with the advantage of being a gluten-free product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Recent research has shown that pulse-derived ingredients present a technological alternative to cereals, higher protein and fibre content, and differentiated starch characteristics. In this work, the partial substitution of pulse flours with and without heat moisture treatment (HMT) was evaluated in a biscuit model. The digestion residues at 20 and 120 min that correspond to rapidly, slowly and resistant starch from the Englyst methodology were analysed by DSC, X-Ray and ATR-FTIR. The use of pulse flours in biscuits improved their thermal stability (DeltaH=3.01 and 4.99 J/g for control and Lentil+ HMT), preserving a fraction of particularlybeta glucans, that influenced the decreasing in the rapidly available starch from 55.26 to 24.11% (Control and Faba bean+ HMT), and enhanced its protein's digestibility from 75.26 to 87.43% for the same sources. Among pulses, there were similarities regarding their resistance to enzymatic hydrolysis that may help select those with better organoleptic attributes. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3388	3399	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14963					FSTA:2021-10-Mq6411
J		Chavis Tiravibulsin; Yaowapa Lorjaroenphon; Pathima Udompijitkul; Pitiya Kamonpatana							Sterilization of coconut milk in flexible packages via ohmic-assisted thermal sterilizer.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Extreme heat treatments of canned coconut milk might reduce overall product quality. Therefore, an ohmic-assisted thermal sterilizer (OATS) may be able to preserve packaged coconut milk as an alternative to an overpressure retort. OATS involves converting electrical energy immediately into heat inside medium, which is then transferred to the food packages. This differs from conventional retorts which relied primarily on heat transfer. To ensure food safety, the OATS was microbiologically validated using Clostridium sporogenes spores. Physicochemical property and aroma compound profile differences in coconut milk sterilized at F of 5.2 min using OATS were compared with conventional water spray retort. OATS completely inactivated C. sporogenes spores with more than 5 log CFU/mL at 121.1 °C for 5 min. The total processing time for OATS was 27 min using 32% less energy compared to the 42 min for the retort, indicating the higher process efficiency of OATS. OATS food products surpassed conventional retort properties in appearance, with minor color changes; off-odor, having a lower cooked odor by reducing methyl-ketone and Maillard reaction products; and desired aromas, by preserving contributors such as ethyl octanoate and delta-lactones. Consequently, OATS could potentially produce sterile coconut milk with minimal changes in appearance while decreasing off-odor formation.

The poor acceptability of provitamin A (PVA)-biofortified maize is still a challenge that exists in Zimbabwe. This study investigated the effect of replacing white maize (WM) with PVA-biofortified maize on the nutritional composition of mutwiwa, a Zimbabwean traditional food, and its microbiological safety. Chemical and microbiological tests were conducted using AOAC standard methods. Total carotene content was 12.78 g/g dry weight (DW) in PVA-biofortified maize and 1.52 g/g DW in WM. The proximate composition of PVA-biofortified mutwiwa (PVABM) was 5.2, 28.6, 2.1, 62.2, and 2.0 g/100 g wet basis (w. B) for protein, carbohydrates fiber, moisture, and ash, respectively. Total soluble solids, beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin A contents were 3.6°Brix, 110 g/100 g, 0.54 mg/100 g, and 9 g REA/100 g, respectively. Lysine, phenylalanine, and histidine contents were 0.71,1.15, and 0.56 g/100 g w. B, respectively. Iron, calcium, phosphorus, and zinc content were 7.8,60.5,410.8, and 60 mg/100 g w.b, respectively. Mesophilic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria, coliforms, yeast, and molds were all <1 Log CFU/ml. The nutritional, amino acid and mineral contents were significantly different (p<.05). In conclusion, the results of this study were satisfying and recommend the processing of PVA-biofortified maize as a potential strategy to combat VAD and mineral malnutrition in Zimbabwe and other regions in Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Chawafambira, A.							The effect of incorporating herbal (Lippia javanica) infusion on the phenolic, physicochemical, and sensorial properties of fruit wine.		Food Science & Nutrition					The use of medicinal herbs in food processing to improve food quality and human health is growing in sub-Saharan Africa. Herbal infusions have perceived medicinal benefits. This study investigated the effect of incorporating L. javanica extract on the phenolic, physicochemical, and sensory properties of a Uapaca kirkiana fruit-based wine. The fruit and L. javanica were analyzed for proximate, pH, total soluble sugars (TSS), total sugar, titratable acidity, phenolics, and antioxidant activity (AOA). The prepared substrate was fermented at optimized fermentation temperature of 23 °C, pH of 3.4, inoculum concentration of 9.5% (v/v) (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and L. javanica extract concentration of 10% (v/v). The produced wine had a pH, total sugar, TSS, total acidity, and vitamin C content of 3.10.2,3.00.1 g/L, 4.80.1%, 5.90.01 g/L, and 4.40.1 mg/100 g, respectively. The wine had 12.22.1 mg GAE/g, 0.060.01 mg/g, and 1.81.1 mg CE/g total phenols, tannins, and flavonoids, respectively. The alcohol, free sulfur dioxide (SO2), AOA, and color values of the produced wine were 10.20.1 alcohol by volume (ABV) %, 58.11.2 mg/L, 73.10.1 EC50 mg/L, and 40.42.1% yellow, respectively. The flavor, color, and overall acceptance of the produced wine were rated as "good" and were significantly different (p<.05) from control wine. The addition of L. javanica extracts enhanced total phenol, color, and sensory properties of the wine. The utilization of U. kirkiana fruit by incorporating L. javanica infusion can reduce postharvest losses and improve nutrition and health. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Chayanika Sarma; Gopinath Mummaleti; Kumar Kalakandan, S.; Suman Thamburaj							Effect of hurdle preservation on quality attributes of Palmyra sap (Borassus flabellifer) for shelf-life extension.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The current study was performed to preserve palmyra sap using hurdle treatments (Ca (OH)2) (TS2), bark extract (TS3), Ca (OH)2 with bark extract (TS4) followed by pasteurization (TS1) (68 °C; 20 min) and were compared to fresh Ca (OH)2 sap (CS) stored at ambient (32 2 °C) and refrigerated (7 1 °C) conditions for 28 days. The physicochemical, microbial, and sensory analysis of stored sap confirmed that TS2 sample had better quality and higher acceptability owing to delayed fermentation. Sample TS2 showed a significant and gradual decrease (p< .05) in pH from 6.8 0.06 to 4.9 0.35 (ambient) and 6.3 0.10 (refrigerated) whereas reducing sugar increased at a slow rate from 0.30 0.01 to 6.02 0.03 (ambient) and 0.42 0.01 (refrigerated) for 28 days. TS2 showed a lower concentration of alcohol during ambient (0.9 0.10%) and refrigerated (0.1 0.06%) conditions for 28 days. Hurdle treatments were effective with a prolonged shelf-life for refrigerated sap as compared to the saps stored under ambient conditions. Novelty impact statement. Utilized different hurdle treatments for extending the shelf-life of palmyra sap stored at different storage conditions. Hurdle treatment involving pasteurization along with calcium hydroxide resulted in lower alcohol formation and successfully reduced microbial count during storage at ambient and refrigerated conditions. The shelf-life of hurdle treated palmyra sap can be predicted using a zero-order model during storage at ambient and refrigerated conditions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15978					FSTA:2022-03-Hs1945

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Currently, the study of mannooligosaccharides (MOS) production from Thai spent coffee grounds (SCGs) and the evaluation of their prebiotic potential have not been documented. This research aimed to characterize the MOS derived from SCGs and to determine their prebiotic properties. SCGs were treated with an alkali treatment. Treated-SCGs were digested by mannanase from Bacillus subtilis GA2 (1). The MOS in SCGs were examined by using HPAEC-PAD analyzer. The results revealed that treated-SCGs was composed of mannose, mannobiose, mannotriose, and mannopentaose. The prebiotic properties were determined by the addition of MOS to lactic acid bacteria (LAB) cultures, by the gastrointestinal tolerance, and by in vitro simulation of the gastrointestinal tract. The addition of MOS into L. acidophilus cultivation could promote the enhancing activity (23.96%) and survival rate under gastrointestinal conditions, especially alpha-amylase conditions for 2 h (77.41%). The pathogen growth inhibition test revealed that a culture after L. casei cultivation containing MOS could inhibit S. paratyphi growth (12.55%). The adhesion results demonstrated that the addition of MOS to LAB culture resulted in significant hydrophobicity (p< 0.05). Therefore, the MOS produced from SCGs has potential as a prebiotic applied in nutraceutical.

Farmers' attitudes towards GM crops and their predictors.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Genetically modified (GM) crops have become a controversial global issue since their commercialization in 1996. However, despite technological advancements, only a few studies have investigated farmers' attitudes towards GM crops in Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to analyse such attitudes and their determining factors. A validated questionnaire was distributed to farmers in the Cameron Highlands, Pahang (n=176). SPSS software was used to analyse the descriptive statistics of the farmers' attitudes to GM crops, while SmartPLS software was used to determine the predictors. Results. Descriptive analysis shows that the farmers claimed to have a high level of self-efficacy, and perceived GM crops as possessing high benefits which translate into a highly positive attitude towards GM crops. However, at the same time, they rated GM crops as involving moderate risks and would incur moderate costs to farm, as well as acknowledging a low level of support from the government. The structural equation model (SEM) analysis demonstrates that five factors have been identified as direct predictors of attitude to GM crops: government support (beta=0.364, P<0.001), perceived costs (beta = -0.282, P<0.01), perceived risks (beta = -0.227, P<0.01), perceived benefits (beta=0.205, P<0.01) and perceived self-efficacy (beta=0.199, P<0.05). Conclusion. This study contributes to the existing knowledge and provides empirical support in explaining the factors that influence farmers' decisions to adopt GM crops and have significant implications for the future development of agro-biotechnology in Malaysia and in other developing countries. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	13	5457	5468	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11194					FSTA:2021-12-Ma7891

Prediction of dairy powder functionality attributes using diffuse reflectance in the visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) region.		International Dairy Journal					The potential of Vis-NIR for the non-invasive determination of physicochemical attributes of dairy powders was investigated for fast assessment of dairy powder quality. Three scanning techniques were compared for the collection of Vis-NIR data, including a portable, a benchtop and a hyperspectral imaging device. Models were developed with commercial dairy powders varying in batch, brand, type and length of storage and tested in a completely independent dataset. Moderate to good performance was achieved for tapped density, insolubility index, surface free fat, moisture content and bulk density (RP2: 0.65-0.88, 0.80-0.85, 0.77-0.87, 0.71-0.86 and 0.71-0.72, respectively). Analysis using variable of importance in projection and selectivity ratio show the uniqueness of each prediction model for the different physicochemical attributes. Three scanning techniques investigated present different opportunities for on-line implementation of this system.

J		Chebib, S.; Schwab, W.							Microscale thermophoresis reveals oxidized glutathione as high-affinity ligand of Mal d 1.		Foods					Pathogenesis-related (PR)-10 proteins, due to their particular secondary structure, can bind various ligands which could be important for their biological function. Accordingly, the PR-10 protein Mal d 1, the major apple allergen, probably also binds molecules in the hydrophobic cavity of its secondary structure, but it has not yet been investigated in this respect. In this study, various natural products found in apples such as flavonoids, glutathione (GSH), and glutathione disulfide (GSSG) were investigated as possible ligands of Mal d 1 using microscale thermophoresis. Dissociation constants of 16.39 M, 29.51 M, 35.79 M, and 0.157 M were determined for catechin, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, GSH, and GSSG, respectively. Molecular docking was performed to better understand the underlying binding mechanism and revealed hydrophobic interactions that stabilize the ligands within the pocket while hydrophilic interactions determine the binding of both GSH derivatives. The binding of these ligands could be important for the allergenicity of the PR-10 protein and provide further insights into its physiological role. © 2021 by the authors.

Mixture design applied for formulation and characterization of vegetal-based fermented products.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present study consists on the characterization of six different flours in order to evaluate their ability to ferment alone and in mixtures. A discrepancy in the composition and physico-chemical characteristics of the flours was recorded. Three of these flours (oats, chickpea and coconut) were selected for the construction of the mixture design, which was used to formulate a base for a fermented vegetable dessert. Oat and chickpea flours have an effect on color accentuation (DeltaE=17.37) as well as on increasing water retention (75.31 g/100 g). During storage, post-acidification of the media to pH 4.42 was recorded, with a water holding capacity ranging from 56.64 to 66.12 g per 100 g, indicating a change in the texture of the mixtures. The fermented plant product showed a high viability of lactic acid bacteria, more than 107 CFU/mL for L. Delbrueckii subsp. Bulgaricus and more than 108 CFU/mL for S. thermophiles after 30 days of storage. The use of flours in the formulation of fermented products was demonstrated as an alternative strategy for the development of new vegetable-based desserts. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, we investigate the effect of different abiotic environmental factors on the chemical constituents of Pistacia atlantica Desf and their bioactive potential. Altitude, temperature, precipitation, and harvest season were the key factors. Forty-three samples of P. atlantica, including leaves and galls, were collected from two different bioclimatic areas (Tilghemt and Aflou), at two separate seasons (2018 and 2019). Phytochemicals were quantified for each sample, and the biological activities were also determined. The present study aimed for the first time to highlight the relationship and the interactions between the environmental factors and the active substance contents of P. atlantica crude oils and phenolic extracts, by the implementation of multivariate statistical analyses. Four principal components were identified with an information percentage varied between 63.47% and 72.67%. The PCA analysis allowed us to classify the phytoconstituents of P. atlantica and their biological activities according to the geographical origin and the climatic conditions into two clouds of points. It seems from our findings that the harvest season factor could tip the scales and affected inversely the phytochemical constituents of P. atlantica leaves and their antioxidant potential. All results consistently supported the conclusion that the variation on the environmental factors had a significant influence on the chemical constituents of crude oils and phenolic extracts as well as their antioxidant activity and EC 3.2.1.1-alpha-amylase inhibitory effect. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Chen Chen; Min Zhang; Arun S. Mujumdar; Pattarapon Phuhongsung							Investigation of 4D printing of lotus root-compound pigment gel: effect of pH on rapid colour change.		Food Research International					The feasibility was investigated of 4D printing of lotus root gel compounded with a pigment that responds to pH change and alters colour. The pigment comprised of a combination of anthocyanins and lemon yellow; it was used in gel preparation for printing. The flowability and self-support properties of the lotus root-pigment gel were studied to evaluate its 3D printing performance. The gel viscosity decreased with the increase of printing temperature over the range 40,50, and 60 °C. The gel with a ratio (lotus root powder/compound pigment) of 0.35 extruded smoothly and maintained high formability at temperatures below 60 °C. The pH response of compound pigment enabled the printed sample to change colour from reddish/yellowish to green after spraying with NaHCO3. The a* and b* values decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after spraying for 1 min. The gel with ratios of 0.30 and 0.35 achieved rapid colour change both superficially and internally. Through several different model designs (apple, Christmas tree, letters, and Chinese characters), high-quality 4D printing could be realized without problem. Thus, lotus root gel can be mixed with suitable pigments in correct proportion for 4D printing at appropriate temperature to ensure good flowability. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Chen Chen; Min Zhang; Chaofan Guo; Huizhi Chen							4D printing of lotus root powder gel: color change induced by microwave.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The feasibility of using microwave to stimulate the color change of curcumin lotus root gel printed by 3D was discussed. Curcumin emulsion was prepared and added into lotus root powder gel for 3D printing. The heat generated by microwave made curcumin exposed to an alkaline environment. The color change from yellow to red was realized by the deprotonation of curcumin. Mainly, the color change of the printing sample before and after the microwave treatment (MT) was measured, and the influence of the emulsion addition and the MT time on it was analyzed. The chroma of the printed sample changed after MT: L* and b* value decreased, while a* value increased. Using a variety of materials could achieve interesting color changes. The textural properties of printed sample changed significantly (p< 0.05) after MT. Printed sample before and after microwave could provide consumers two different sensory experiences, thus contributing a new method for 4D food printing. Industrial relevance Based on the traditional 3D printing technology, this work uses microwave as the stimulus source to realize the color change of printed product, and provides a new method for producing colorful and attractive food through 4D printing.

J		Chen Chen; Ke Huang; Haiyan Yu; Huaixiang Tian							The diversity of microbial communities in Chinese milk fan and their effects on volatile organic compound profiles.		Journal of Dairy Science					Milk fan is a cheese-like fermented milk product produced in Yunnan Province, China. In this study, we characterized the microbial communities of milk fan from 6 distinct geographical origins and investigated their generation of volatile organic compounds (VOC). The microbial communities found in all milk fan samples were dominated by Lactococcus, Lactobacillus, and Raoultella bacteria and Rhodotorula, Torulaspora, and Candida fungi. Samples from the Kunming and Weishan regions had greater bacterial richness, and samples from Xizhou had greater fungal community richness. Sixty prominent VOC (i.e., those having odor activity values ≥1), including esters, acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and aromatic compounds, were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of milk fan samples. Pearson correlation analysis revealed that Lactobacillus, Rhodotorula, Lodderomyces, and Debaryomyces had significant correlations with various VOC, revealing a total of 13 compounds that are characteristic of the odor of milk fan. These bacteria and fungi are therefore identified as functional microorganisms that collectively create the complex VOC profile of milk fan. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the microbial community of milk fan and demonstrates its contribution to the unique aroma profile of this fermented milk product All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Surface browning is the primary limiting factor for the shelf-life of fresh-cut apple. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) treatment is known to effectively inhibit the browning, however, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism. In the present paper RNA-Seq technology was used to analyse the transcript expression profiles of control and H2S treated fresh-cut apple immediately after treatment (C0 and S0) and 6 d of storage (C6 and S6) at 4 °C. The results identified 3782 and 1164 differentially expressed unigenes (DEGs) in S0 vs. C0 and S6 vs. C6, respectively. Expression of most DEGs related to antioxidant systems and energy metabolism was up-regulated after H2S treatment, whilst expression of genes encoding polyphenol oxidase, peroxidase, lipid-degrading enzymes, such as lipoxygenase and phospholipase D, was repressed. Further quantitative real-time PCR testing validated the reliability of our RNA-Seq results. We therefore propose that H2S treatment inhibited the surface browning of fresh-cut apple by regulating antioxidant, energy and lipid metabolism to maintain the membrane integrity of the plant tissue.

Food Chemistry					The influences of the different structural flaxseed lignans on flaxseed oil (FO) emulsions during storage and digestion were investigated, focusing on their interfacial behavior. From perspective of interface, more than 60% of secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and the acidic hydrolysates of flaxseed lignan macromolecule (FLEH) were located on the interface of FO emulsions. It improved the stability of FO emulsions both during storage and digestion by inhibiting of free radical penetration and improving their targeted antioxidative activity. By comparison, the secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) and the alkaline hydrolysates of flaxseed lignan macromolecule (FLE) largely located in the aqueous and exerted lower antioxidative efficiency in emulsions. Moreover, SDG, SECO, FLE and FLEH slowed down the digestive rate of FO in emulsions, which might be due to flaxseed lignans inhibited the activity of digestive enzymes. These findings suggested that the different structural flaxseed lignans had the potential as antioxidants in emulsions during storage and digestion. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Research International					In this study, pectin changes during Red haricot bean storage under high temperature and high humidity conditions were investigated to understand the hard-to-cook (HTC) development from a microstructural point of view. First, to ensure repeatability of the microscopy results, a classification of the fresh and stored beans (aged at 35 °C and 83% relative humidity) into different hardening levels (the Non-aged, Aged and Very-hard aged sample) was performed based on the texture values of cooked half-cotyledons. Cell wall strength of the cotyledons was evaluated, showing that the aged samples (HTC seeds) exhibit stronger cell walls with more/stronger pectic cross-linkages than the Non-aged sample. After a sequential pectin extraction aiming at removing pectin fractions of different solubility, cell wall autofluorescence and immunolabeling of JIM7, LM9 and 2F4 epitopes in the residual materials were examined. Upon ageing, the samples exhibited an increased Ca2+-pectin and ferulic acid-pectin crosslinking, these pectic complexes being accumulated primarily at the intercellular spaces. The results suggest a contribution of both the pectin-cation-phytate hypothesis and the involvement of phenolic-pectin crosslinks in HTC development at the cotyledon during storage of common beans.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been implicated in regulating muscle fiber. However, which isomer elicits this effect and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, male C57BL6/J mice and C2C12 cells were treated with two CLA isomers, and the exercise endurance, skeletal muscle fiber type, and involvement of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling were assessed. The results demonstrated that dietary t10, c12, but not c9, t11-CLA isomer enhanced exercise endurance of mice (from 115.88 11.21 to 130.00 15.84 min, P< 0.05) and promoted the formation of oxidative muscle fiber type of gastrocnemius muscle (from 0.15 0.04 to 0.24 0.05, P< 0.05). Consistently, t10, c12-CLA isomer increased the mRNA expression of oxidative muscle fiber type in C2C12 myotubes (from 1.00 0.08 to 2.65 1.77, P< 0.05). In addition, t10, c12-CLA isomer increased TLR4 signaling expression in skeletal muscle and C2C12 myotubes. More importantly, knockdown of TLR4 eliminated the t10, c12-CLA isomer-induced enhancement of exercise endurance in mice and elevation of oxidative muscle fiber type in C2C12 myotubes and gastrocnemius muscle. Together, these findings showed that t10, c12, but not c9, t11-CLA isomer enhances exercise endurance by increasing oxidative skeletal muscle fiber type via TLR4 signaling.										2021	69	51	15636	15648	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06280					FSTA:2022-05-Aj7441

Journal of Cereal Science					Rice bran is one of the most valuable nutritional byproducts of rice milling. It is known to have an unacceptable flavor to consumers, so the development of reliable analytical methods to determine its unpleasant volatile compounds should be developed. Comparative volatile profiling of rice bran at different times of accelerated storage was performed using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) coupled to GC/MS, and the impact of stabilizing methods on the odor of rice bran was evaluated using E-nose, GC/MS and gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) analyses. Sixty-five volatile compounds were identified and classified into six groups. Among them, the relative concentration of aldehydes increased with storage time, and hexanal was the compound with the highest content. Similar behavior was exhibited by ketones and alcohols, which were connected with early oxidation of rice bran. The main characteristic odor compounds of rice bran were vanillin, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol and 5-amino-2-methoxyphenol regarding ferulic acid. Through PCA, the volatile compounds of six kinds of rice bran were distinguished. The GC-O experiment verified that the processed products changed from the original grassy, oily flavor to vanilla, cheese, and caramel flavors. These results comprehensively elucidate the flavor characteristics of rice bran and provide important theoretical support for the development of rice bran products.

J		Chen, H.; Ellett, J. K.; Phillips, R.; Feng, Y.							Small-scale produce growers' barriers and motivators to value-added business: food safety and beyond.		Food Control					Small-scale produce growers are increasingly interested in making value-added products because it enables them to expand profits while reducing food waste. However, small-scale growers also face challenges in establishing value-added businesses, such as a lack of understanding about food safety regulations and limited resources. This study identifies produce growers' barriers and motivators to starting and expanding value-added businesses from the perspective of growers and farmers market managers in Indiana. A combination of quantitative (web-based survey) and qualitative (focus group and semi-structured interview) methods were used in this study. A total of 136 produce growers participated through focus groups (n=38) and a web-based survey (n=98); 14 farmers market managers participated in semi-structured interviews. Four major motivators for starting and expanding a value-added business included increasing profits, reducing food waste, meeting customers' demands for food products, and personal preferences. Barriers to establishing a value-added business were classified into three major categories: regulations, resources, and marketing. Growers perceived the regulations for selling value-added products as complicated, ambiguous, and restrictive. Additionally, a lack of resources, including time, labor, cost, infrastructure, the amount of available produce, and outside support, were reported to hamper the establishment of a value-added business. Some growers also reported difficulties with marketing their products to increase their sales. The findings of this study provide evidence for policymakers to use in their decision-making processes. It also serves as a guide for researchers and educators in the development of appropriate business development strategies and research and education programs for small-scale growers.

J		Chen, H.; Weersink, A.; Kelton, D.; Massow, M. von							Estimating milk loss based on somatic cell count at the cow and herd level.		Journal of Dairy Science					There is a direct relationship between elevated somatic cell count (SCC) in an individual cow milk production and milk loss. This relationship has been used at the herd level to estimate an overall herd milk loss due to subclinical mastitis and to use recovery of this lost milk as a financial benefit to cover the cost of intervention strategies to improve milk quality. The objective of this study was to estimate the recoverable milk revenue on a per cow basis for herds moving from one herd average SCC level to a newer, lower level. Test-day records from 1,005,697 dairy cows in 3,741 herds between 2009 to 2019 were used. Milk yield loss for each cow in each herd on test day was estimated using a mixed effects regression equation, and then summed to estimated total herd milk loss. These herd average daily milk loss estimates were then related to the bulk tank SCC, and the distribution of underlying individual cow SCC were examined. The distributions in daily herd milk loss for various bulk tank SCC values were generated, and estimates of recoverable milk loss were generated to simulate a herd moving from their current bulk tank SCC to a new lower level. The results indicate that estimates of total herd milk yield loss vary with the distribution of cow-level SCC and parity within the herd, so it is imperative that milk loss be calculated on a per cow basis. Further, the recoverable milk loss estimates based on moving to a lower bulk tank SCC where milk loss is still occurring was relatively small compared with the traditional assumption that all milk loss would be recovered, and less than most herd owners and advisors would expect.

Food Chemistry					A lipidomic evaluation was performed on the tilapia muscle, head and viscera, including studying the composition, distribution and stereospecific characteristics of fatty acids and lipid species. The head and viscera lipids were significantly richer than the muscle lipids. Triacylglycerols were the predominant fraction (over 80% of total lipid in the muscle and head). Additionally, polyunsaturated fatty acids had higher percentages in phospholipids (30.35-52.05% of total fatty acids) than in triacylglycerols (18.11-25.15%). The C52:2 and C52:3 were the most abundant triacylglycerols, which indicates the potential application in infant food. Moreover, 622, 530 and 513 lipids were identified using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight-mass spectrometry in the muscle, head and viscera, respectively. The three tilapia parts were distinguished using multivariate analysis. Five fatty acids and 33 lipid species were considered as the potential biomarkers. This comprehensive analysis will help to evaluate the lipid nutritional values and facilitate exploitation in tilapia consumption and processing.

J		Chen Huan; Qihang Xu; Shen Shuling; Jingxian Dong; Xiaolin Zheng							Effect of benzothiadiazole treatment on quality and anthocyanin biosynthesis in plum fruit during storage at ambient temperature.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Plums tend to experience a reduction in fruit quality due to ripening and they deteriorate quickly during storage at room temperature. Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a plant elicitor capable of inducing disease resistance in many crops. In this study, the effect of BTH treatment on fruit ripening, fruit quality, and anthocyanin biosynthesis in "Taoxingli" plum was investigated. Results. The results showed that BTH treatment could accelerate fruit ripening without affecting the incidence of fruit decay or the shelf life. Benzothiadiazole treatment improved the quality and consumer acceptability of "Taoxingli" plums during storage by increasing the sweetness, red color formation, and the concentration of healthy antioxidant compounds. The BTH treatment could also effectively promote the biosynthesis of anthocyanin by enhancing the enzyme activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and uridine diphosphate flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UFGT) and up-regulating the gene expressions of PsPAL, PsCHI, PsDFR, PsANS, and PsUFGT during storage. Conclusion. Benzothiadiazole treatment could be a potential postharvest technology for improving fruit quality and consumer acceptability in harvested plum fruit. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Chen Huan; Huihong Li; Zhenye Jiang; Sheng'e Li; Shuling Shen; Xiaolin Zheng							Effect of hypobaric treatment on off-flavour development and energy metabolism in "Bruno" kiwifruit.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa cv. Bruno) can more easily acquire "alcoholic flavour" due to the accumulation of ethanol under normal ripening conditions compared to the other cultivars of kiwifruit. In this study, the effects of hypobaric treatment (255 kPa for 30 min) one time (T1) and two times (T2) on fruit quality, ethanol metabolism and energy metabolism in "Bruno" kiwifruit were investigated during room temperature storage. The results showed that T2 treatment effectively reduced fruit decay and weight loss during the whole storage period, and both T1 and T2 treatments maintained higher values of total phenolic, quinic acid and citric acid than CK during the late stage of storage. Moreover, the hypobaric treatments reduced alcoholic flavour development, while T2 treatment was more effective than T1 treatment. The mechanism for this effect might involve two aspects. On the one hand, T2 treatment enhanced aerobic metabolism by increasing the energy level and the activities of succinic dehydrogenase (SDH), cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) and H+-adenosine triphosphatase (H+-ATPase) during the late stage of storage. On the other hand, T2 treatment inhibited anaerobic metabolism by decreasing the concentrations of acetaldehyde and ethanol and the activities of pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). In conclusion, we speculated that the effect of hypobaric treatment on "Bruno" kiwifruit might be involved in the regulation of aerobic and anaerobic metabolisms during storage at room temperature.

J		Chen Huan; Xijie Du; Lufan Wang; Kebbeh, M.; Huihong Li; Xiaohan Yang; Shuling Shen; Xiaolin Zheng							Transcriptome analysis reveals the metabolisms of starch degradation and ethanol fermentation involved in alcoholic off-flavour development in kiwifruit during ambient storage.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Kiwifruit tends to develop alcoholic off-flavour after long-term storage, leading to decreased fruit market value. Actinidia eriantha "white" and Actinidia deliciosa "Bruno" are two major cultivated kiwifruits in China. Compared to A. eriantha "white", A. deliciosa "Bruno" is prone to developing alcoholic off-flavour associated with ethanol accumulation during storage at ambient conditions without any stresses. In this study, to better understand the complex mechanisms responsible for developing alcoholic off-flavour in kiwifruit during postharvest, transcriptome analysis was used to compare the difference in metabolic pathways between kiwifruits "white" and "Bruno" during ripening at ambient storage. Our results indicated that the development of alcoholic off-flavour in kiwifruit "Bruno" might be associated with three metabolic pathways: the respiration and ethylene metabolisms, starch and sucrose metabolism and ethanol fermentation metabolism. In kiwifruit "Bruno", the higher respiration rate and ethylene production might increase the energy conversion and internal carbon dioxide (CO2) accumulation. Moreover, the higher expressions of starch phosphorylases (SPs), beta-amylases, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases (UGPases), sucrose synthases (SSs) and invertases (INVs) accelerated starch degradation along with soluble sugars accumulation in kiwifruit "Bruno", which could provide adequate substrates for ethanol fermentation. In addition, the higher activity of ethanol fermentation metabolism associated with higher expressions of pyruvate kinases (PKs), NADP-dependent malic enzymes (NADP-MEs), pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs) might directly increase the ethanol production.

J		Chen, L.; Lengi, A. J.; Corl, B. A.							The inhibitory effect of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid on sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 activation in bovine mammary epithelial cells involved reduced proteasomal degradation of insulin-induced gene-1.		Journal of Dairy Science					Trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid (t10, c12 CLA) is well recognized as a key CLA isomer responsible for the reduction in milk fat synthesis that leads to milk fat depression in dairy cows. Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP1) is a key transcription factor in bovine mammary gland coordinating transcription of the genes for fatty acid synthesis. SREBP1 activation requires the removal of insulin-induced gene-1 (Insig1) that serves as a repressor of SREBP1 in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We hypothesized that t10,c12 CLA reduced SREBP1 activation by delaying Insig1 degradation. In the present study, we used undifferentiated bovine mammary epithelial cells (MAC-T cells) and treated them with t10,c12 CLA for 6 h. We found that SREBP1 protein expression declined over 56% when cells were treated with 60 M or greater concentration of t10,c12 CLA. Such inhibitory effects were also observed in the mRNA expression of SREBP1-regulated genes including SREBP1, fatty acid synthetase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and Insig1. Compared with no CLA group, 60 M or higher concentration of t10,c12 CLA increased Insig1 protein expression over 2-fold in cells transfected with FLAG-tagged Insig1. This stimulatory effect was not specific to t10,c12 CLA but also other polyunsaturated fatty acids including cis-9,trans-11 CLA and linoleic acid. Oleic acid had no effect on Insig1 protein expression, whereas palmitic acid decreased Insig1 protein expression. Further investigation revealed that increased abundance of FLAG-Insig1 with t10,c12 CLA was due to the inhibition of the proteasomal degradation of Insig1. The t10,c12 CLA delayed the Insig1 decay when protein synthesis was blocked. Immunoprecipitation also confirmed that the interaction between ubiquitin-like domain-containing protein 8 and Insig1, the key step of removing Insig1 from ER and freeing SREBP1 for proteolytic processing, was inhibited by t10,c12 CLA, but not palmitic acid. These findings suggested that t10,c12 CLA played a role in regulating SREBP1 activation by reducing proteasomal degradation of Insig1. We concluded that stabilized Insig1 retained SREBP1 in the ER from activation, thus reducing lipogenic gene transcription. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A buckwheat trypsin inhibitor mutant with enhanced activity (rEBTI) was expressed, purified, and immobilized onto Sepharose CL-4B matrix. The optimum pH for the adsorption by, and desorption of porcine trypsin from the rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B column were 8 and 3.5, respectively. The rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B was applied to purify trypsin from grass carp hepatopancreas to verify its practical utility. The enzyme was purified by one-step chromatography and migrated as a single band with molecular mass of 27 kDa from sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The optimal temperature and pH of the purified enzyme were 60 °C and 9.5, respectively, and it was stable within pH 6.0-12.0. The apparent Km value of the purified enzyme was determined as 3.4*10-5 M using N-benzoyl-dl-arginine-nitroanilide as substrate. The trypsin was activated by Ba2+ and Mg2+, but was inhibited by Zn2+, EDTA and vitamin C. The novel trypsin affinity material rEBTI-Sepharose CL-4B could obtain grass carp trypsin of high purify by one-step purification, which is less tedious and more cost-effective than most current methods. The process can produce the enzyme in high purity to meet high-end biotechnological applications in the biomedical and pharmaceutical industries.

European Food Research and Technology					Cinnamomum verum and Cinnamomum cassia are widely used as spice and herbal medicine around the world. However, it is challenging to differentiate and make a quality evaluation for both Cinnamomum types due to their similarities in morphological features and general chemical composition using traditional analytical methods. In this study, a simple and efficient method was developed for the comprehensive evaluation of the two Cinnamomum, together with Cassia twig, by combining UPLC fingerprint analysis combined with quantitative analysis using two internal standards for the determination of multiple components (TSDMC). The content of 9 components (procyanidin B2, cinnamtannin B1, coumarin, 2-hydroxycinnamaldehyde, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, 2'-methoxycinnamaldehyde, and eugenol) in samples was determined using reliable relative conversion factor factors that were obtained using procyanidin B2 and cinnamic acid as two internal reference standards. The quantitative results combined with chemometrics analysis were employed to identify these samples. This simple and reproducible method revealed great differences among the three Cinnamomum in their chemical composition and provides a promising method for accurate differentiation and quality evaluation for the three Cinnamomum. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	11	2687	2698	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03795-x					FSTA:2022-01-Te0180

Food Analytical Methods					The neomycin residues in milk could pose potential hazard for human health, and now, immunoassays are widely used for on-site screening of neomycin and other food contaminate residues. In this paper, the neomycin B was conjugated with carrier protein as immunogens, and a highly specific antibody was produced. Based on the produced antibody, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and a new flow-through immunoaffinity chromatography test (FTIACT) were developed for rapid analysis of neomycin B residues in milk. The developed ELISA has a detection limit of 162.5 pg/mL in milk, which is suitable for detecting neomycin B residues at picogram levels, while the optimized FTIACT exhibited satisfactory compatibility with the ELISA, with limits of detection of 326.8 fg/mL in milk, which is more suitable for on-site detecting neomycin B residues at femtogram levels. For the quantitative FTIACT, the recoveries from spiked milk ranged from 69 to 131%, with a relative standard deviation of less than 15%. Compared to traditional ELISA formats, the developed FTIACT provided lower detection limits for neomycin B residue analysis. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	11	2298	2307	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02058-5					FSTA:2022-02-Pe0668

Interindividual differences in human in vitro intestinal microbial conversion of green tea (-)-epigallocatechin-3-o-gallate and consequences for activation of Nrf2 mediated gene expression.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. An in vitro faecal incubation model combined with reporter gene assay based testing strategy is developed to characterize interindividual differences in the gut microbial conversion of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG) and its consequences for potential activation of Nrf2-mediated gene expression. Method & Results. Anaerobic human faecal incubations are performed to characterize the microbial metabolism of EGCG including interindividual variability. EGCG derived intestinal microbial metabolite patterns show substantial interindividual differences that are correlated to relative microbial abundances determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. Results. Obtained show the time-dependent formation of gallic acid, pyrogallol, phenylpropane-2-ols, phenyl-gamma-valerolactones, and 5-(3′, 5′-dihydroxyphenyl) valeric acidas the majormetabolites, with substantial interindividual differences. The activity of the formed metabolites in the activation of EpRE-mediated gene expression is tested by EpRE-LUX reporter gene assay. In contrast to EGCG, at low micromolar concentrations, especially gallic acid, pyrogallol, and catechol induce significant activity in the EpRE-LUX assay. Conclusions. Given these results and taking the level of formation into account, it is concluded that especially gallic acid and pyrogallol contribute to the EpRE-mediated beneficial effects of EGCG. The interindividual differences in the formation may result in interindividual differences in the beneficial effects of EGCG and green tea consumption. © 2020 The Authors.

Food & Function					In the present study, the influence of lipid emulsion on the allergenicity of digestion products of fish parvalbumin (PV) was investigated, which was initially subjected to simulated gastric/intestinal digestion both under emulsified and non-emulsified conditions. The release of beta-hexosaminidase (beta-hex), histamine (His), tryptase (TPS), interleukin 4 (IL-4), and IL-13 in RBL cells was decreased by 79.32, 26.19, 41.67, 53.95 and 54.40%, respectively, following stimulation with the gastric digestion products of PV. Whereas, lipid emulsified digestion products of PV (e-PV) significantly enhanced the release of active mediators and cytokines. The digestion products of emulsified PV at 180 min resulted in a higher release of beta-hex (197.60%), His (12.18%), TPS (38.85%), IL-4 (48.19%) and IL-13 (59.40%), as compared to that of PV. However, no obvious differences in the release of active substances and cytokines were noted between intestinal digestion products of PV and intestinal digestion products of emulsified PV. In the mouse model studies, digested PV products reduced the anaphylactic scores, whereas e-PV manifested a higher level of allergic symptoms. Moreover, mice treated with 50% e-PV had significantly higher levels of specific IgE (32.56%), total IgE (16.67%) and total IgG1 (5.15%) than those treated with 50% PV. Mice treated with 50% e-PV had significantly higher levels of His (8.50%) and TPS (10.07%) compared with mice treated with 50% PV. Lipid emulsions altered the digestibility of PV in gastrointestinal digestion and enhanced the allergenicity of PV digestion products at the cellular levels, subsequently posing a higher risk of allergic reactions in susceptible individuals. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	12	5351	5360	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00575h					FSTA:2021-10-Rc3453
J		Chen Tan; Jing Wang; Baoguo Sun							Polysaccharide dual coating of yeast capsules for stabilization of anthocyanins.		Food Chemistry					The dual coated yeast capsules for anthocyanin encapsulation and stabilization were fabricated. Anthocyanins were preloaded in hollow yeast capsules, and then the dual coating was performed by deposition of opposite charged polysaccharides using layer-by-layer technique. The combination of positively charged chitosan and negatively charged chondroitin sulfate was found to confer the yeast capsules with the highest encapsulation efficiency and retention rate of anthocyanins. Additionally, the coated yeast capsules featured high tolerance to environmental stresses (i.e., oxygen, ascorbic acid, and heat) and therefore effectively inhibited the degradation of anthocyanins. These stabilizing effects were related to the formation of high penetration barrier provided by the double layers of polysaccharides, as well as the enhanced hydrophobic microenvironment in the capsules. Further development of the polysaccharide-coated yeast capsules may hold promise for the controlled delivery of other water-soluble bioactive components.

Food Chemistry					Phenolic compounds are the important taste source of tea infusion. In this paper, the phenolic compounds in tea extracts were separated by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), and then in-situ determined by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DESI-MS). Total 44 phenolic compounds in tea extracts were accurately confirmed by NIST library as well as reference substances. The clustering results of heat-map can better reflect the differences of phenolic compounds in different categories and subcategories of teas. Besides, the contents of hydrolyzable tannins, including galloylglucose, digalloylglucose, trigalloyglucose and strictinin, were positively correlated with the grades of green tea. The method validation and quantification results of exemplified five phenolic compounds in teas were also obtained, and LODs, LOQs and recoveries were ranging between 1.5-15.9 mug/mL, 5.1-53.1 mug/mL, and 79%-117.6%, respectively. Moreover, HPTLC-DESI-MS can save tenfold analytical time compared to HPLC-MS. Therefore, HPTLC-DESI-MS was a rapid, efficient characterization method of phenolic compounds in tea extracts.

J		Chen Wang; Iftikhar Ali; Daijie Wang; Tongtong Hong; Jinjie Zhang; Chao Li; Wenge Yang							Polyphenols separated from Enteromorpha clathrata by one-dimensional coupled with inner-recycling high-speed counter-current chromatography and their antioxidant activities.		European Food Research and Technology					Algae polyphenols, derived from marine algae, have gained much attention in recent years for their diverse biological activities, such as antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and cholesterol-lowering effects. Extraction, purification, and identification of individual compounds are difficult due to the broad range of molecular sizes and complex structures. In this paper, an efficient separation of polyphenols from Enteromorpha clathrata (E. clathrata), commonly found in the southeast coast of China, was achieved using ultrasonic-assisted extraction and multistage extraction followed by one-dimensional coupled with inner-recycling high-speed counter-current chromatography. The structure was identified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Seven compounds with a purity of greater than 90% were separated from the ethyl acetate extract of E. clathrata, and identified as hydroquinone, gallic acid, (-)-epigallocatechin, caffeine, (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate, and epicatechin-3-O-gallate. These compounds were first separated and identified from E. clathrata. All of the six polyphenols exhibited potent antioxidant activity measured as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity, while (-)-epicatechin and epicatechin-3-O-gallate showed poor hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity, in comparison with Vitamin C (VC). The antioxidant activity of polyphenols with the same number of benzene rings was positively proportional to the number of phenolic hydroxyl groups. Esterification appeared to enhance the antioxidant activity of catechin and reduce the hydroxyl radical scavenging capacity of gallic acid. Our results about the separation, identification, and antioxidant activity of polyphenols from E. clathrata provide a basis for further elucidating the relationship between structure and antioxidant activity, which will promote the development and utilization of E. clathrata antioxidants. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	7	1791	1802	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03751-9					FSTA:2021-10-Rg3445

Food Chemistry					A non-enzymatic browning reaction occurs easily in Dongbei Suancai (DS) during storage. Using the method of path analysis, the changes in contents of VC (ascorbic acid), polyphenol, reducing sugar, amino nitrogen, and 5-HMF (5-hydroxymethyl furfural) were investigated to analyze the direct pathways and determinants of browning caused by pre-production blanching at 100 °C (R-100), salt-addition increased from 2% to 6% (Y-6) and fermentation time extended from 30 d to 40 d (T-40), respectively. The results showed that R-100 could delay the browning by inhibiting two direct pathways of oxidative decomposition of VC and oxidation-polymerization of polyphenols, but T-40 could lead to an increase in degree of browning for which primary determinant was the interaction between polyphenol and reducing sugar, while Y-6 had no obvious effect on browning pathway and determinants. R-100 was thus deemed to be a good measure with inhibiting non-enzymatic browning in DS during storage.

Food & Function					The role of supplementation with different Bacteroides fragilis (B. fragilis) strains in alleviating ulcerative colitis (UC) is unclear due to the controversial results from animal experiments. In this study, three B. fragilis strains were evaluated for their ability to alleviate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in C57BL/6J mice. We analyzed the anti-inflammatory effects of different B. fragilis strains and the changes they caused in the intestinal microbiota composition, intestinal epithelial permeability, cytokine concentrations, protein expression of nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) and the underlying specific genes. The results showed that when orally administered, the different B. fragilis strains exerted different effects on the assessed parameters of the mice. The results of real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence staining showed that the supplementation of B. fragilis FSHCM14E1, but not FJSWX11BF, enhanced the expression of the tight-junction proteins ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1. Western blot analysis showed that the anti-inflammatory effects of B. fragilis FSHCM14E1 were related to the NF-kappaB pathway. Genomic analysis suggested that the anti-inflammatory effects of FSHCM14E1 may be mediated through specific genes associated with defense mechanisms and the secretion of SCFAs. Overall, this study indicates the therapeutic potential of B. fragilis FSHCM14E1 for the prevention of UC. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	18	8300	8313	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00875g					FSTA:2022-01-Ad0359

Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, the camellia oil-loaded Pickering emulsion stabilized by soybean protein isolate (SPI) was selected, and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance were adopted to characterize the emulsion transformation process besides conventional characterization index. Results. Showed that the T2 distribution of SPI dispersion only showed one hydrogen pool, and Tcur, T2W and T2 all decreased with the increase of SPI concentration, indicating faster decay and lower proton mobility, which was companied by increasing particle diameter. The addition of NaCl and heating (95 °C, 15 min) can speed up the relaxation decay, increase the surface hydrophobicity and reduce the nanoparticle diameter. As for the emulsion, three hydrogen populations were observed on T2 distribution. Based on the correlation results, the hydrogen pools were successfully attributed to oil and water phase, respectively. Meanwhile, with the increase of oil volume fraction (0.1-0.6), the Tcur and T2W tended to decrease, the absorbed protein percentage (AP%) and the shear viscosity tended to increase, while the droplet diameter only increased significantly when Phi was below 0.3. Lastly, the T2 distribution of the oleogel showed two hydrogen populations, and the population (T22) could be interpreted as the mobility of protons in oil molecules, which accounted for more than 95% of the total signal. Although the elastic properties of oleogel became weaker with the increase of Phi, the Tcur and T2W were relatively stable. However, it was significantly distinctive from that of SPI dispersion and emulsion. In summary, LF-NMR could be used for the rapid characterization of emulsion.

Food Microbiology					Daqu, a brick-shaped product spontaneously fermented under an open environment, has been regarded as the starter of fermentation, raw enzyme preparation and raw materials for baijiu production. However, its contribution in baijiu fermentation has not been fully elaborated yet. Here, the effects of daqu microbiota on baijiu fermentation were investigated under both field-scale and lab-scale conditions. In field-scale baijiu fermentation, the dominant daqu microbes (average relative abundance>10.0%), including unclassified_ Leuconostocaceae, Thermoascus, and Thermomyces, tended to dominate the early stage (0-7 d). However, the rare daqu microbes (average relative abundance <0.1%, e.g., Kazachstania) tended to dominate the middle and late stages (11-40 d). In addition, some genera showed differences in species diversity between daqu and fermented grains. The average relative abundance of Lactobacillus was over 75% during baijiu fermentation, and most of them were affiliated with Lactobacillus acetotolerans, while Lactobacillus crustorum dominated the Lactobacillus OTUs in daqu. The similar patterns were also observed during lab-scale baijiu fermentation. The results of function prediction showed the enriched metabolic pathways were associated with glycolysis and long-chain fatty acid esters in baijiu fermentation. These results improved the understanding of daqu microbiota function during baijiu fermentation and provided a basic theory to support the regulation of baijiu production.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Wheat Qu contains various microorganisms and is the fermentation starter for rice wine. The impact of geographic location on the volatile compounds and microbial communities in wheat Qu remains unknown. This study demonstrated significant differences in the volatile compound profiles of wheat Qu from different regions of China. Phenylethyl alcohol, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, 9-octadecenoic acid methyl ester, and 2-octanone were the main volatile compounds detected. The bacterial and fungal communities in wheat Qu also differed significantly according to geographic location with both communities explaining the variation in volatile compounds (bacteria making the greater contribution). The bacterial community was dominated by Pediococcus, Weissella, and Lactobacillus while the fungal community was dominated by Saccharomycopsis and Rhizopus. Bacteria exhibited more significant associations with volatile compounds than fungi did. Prediction of metabolic function demonstrated significantly different profiles for the bacterial communities from different regions. These data showed that geographic location considerably affects the composition of volatile compounds and microbial communities in wheat Qu, with the bacterial community being the main contributor to variation of volatile compounds.

Analysis and comparison of key proteins in Maiwa yak and bovine milk using high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.		Journal of Dairy Science					Yak milk is an essential and predominant food resource for Tibetan people for subsistence purposes and to combat altitude-induced challenges. Due to its unique qualities, yak milk has recently been gaining broader attention from consumers across China as well in other parts of the world. One of the key characteristics of yak milk is the protein content, which is about 40 to 60% higher than that of native bovine milk. In this work, a sensitive and reproducible high-throughput analytical method was developed employing both ultra high-performance liquid chromatography Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific) high-resolution accurate mass spectroscopy (UHPLC-HRAM-MS) and UHPLC coupled with triple quadrupole tandem MS (UHPLC-QqQ-MS) to simultaneously analyze 8 milk proteins. A total of 15 Maiwa yak milk samples and 15 bovine milk samples were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed using targeted proteomics and compared for alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, alphaS1-casein, alphaS2-casein, beta-casein, kappa-casein, lactoferrin, and osteopontin. Peptides of beta-lactoglobulin were used to specifically distinguish yak and bovine milk. The results showed that this novel detection method could quantitatively detect these major and minor milk proteins with >0.99 linear correlation coefficient and a recovery rate between 90 and 120%, with relative standard deviations typically less than 10%. The data revealed that yak milk not only had higher overall milk protein content than bovine milk but higher lactoferrin and osteopontin contents as well. The lactoferrin content of yak milk was about 30% higher than that of bovine milk, and the osteopontin content of yak milk was nearly twice that of bovine milk. The application of this method demonstrates that UHPLC-HRAM-MS and UHPLC-QqQ-MS are suitable for high-throughput qualitative and quantitative analysis of major and minor proteins of yak and bovine milk.

Genetic analysis of milk urea concentration and its genetic relationship with selected traits of interest in dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters of milk urea concentration (MU) and its genetic correlations with milk production traits, longevity, and functional traits in the first 3 parities in dairy cows. The edited data set consisted in 9,107,349 MU test-day records from the first 3 parities of 560,739 cows in 2,356 herds collected during the years 1994 to 2020. To estimate the genetic parameters of MU, data of 109 randomly selected herds, with a total of 770,016 MU test-day records, were used. Genetic parameters and estimated breeding values were estimated using a multiple-trait (parity) random regression model. Herd-test-day, age-year-season of calving, and days in milk classes (every 5 d as a class) were used as fixed effects, whereas effects of herd-year of calving, permanent environment, and animal were modeled using random regressions and Legendre polynomials of order 2. The average daily heritability and repeatability of MU during days in milk 5 to 365 in the first 3 parities were 0.19, 0.22, 0.20, and 0.48, 0.48, 0.47, respectively. The mean genetic correlation estimated among MU in the first 3 parities ranged from 0.96 to 0.97. The average daily estimated breeding values for MU of the selected bulls (n = 1,900) ranged from -9.09 to 7.37 mg/dL. In the last 10 yr, the genetic trend of MU has gradually increased. The genetic correlation between MU and 11 traits of interest ranged from -0.28 (milk yield) to 0.28 (somatic cell score). The findings of this study can be used as the first step for development of a routine genetic evaluation for MU and its inclusion into the genetic selection program in the Walloon Region of Belgium.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					2,5-Dimethylpyrazine (2,5-DMP) is an important pharmaceutical intermediate and an important essence. Conventional chemical synthesis methods are often accompanied by toxic substances as by-products, and the biosynthesis efficiency of 2,5-DMP is insufficient for industrial applications. In this study, the tdh and soaao genes were overexpressed to enhance enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions in metabolic pathways, and kbl was knocked out to block competitive branching carbon flow metabolic pathways. Finally, a genetically engineered Escherichia coli strain with the highest carbon recovery rate (30.18%) and the highest yield reported to date was successfully constructed, and 9.21 g.L-1 threonine was able to produce 1682 mg.L-1 2,5-DMP after 24 h. At the same time, an expression regulation strategy and whole-cell biocatalysis helped to eliminate the damage to cells caused by 2,5-DMP, aminoacetone, and reactive oxygen species generated by aminoacetone oxidase from S. oligofermentans, and the negative effect of 2-amino-3-ketobutyrate CoA ligase on the yield of 2,5-DMP in E. coli was also demonstrated.										2021	69	8	2512	2521	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07408					FSTA:2021-07-Bc1072

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In this study, the effect of algal oil rich in docosahexaenoic acid on the mucosal injury with gut microbiota disorders caused by ceftriaxone sodium (CS) was evaluated. The results showed that algal oil treatment (500 mg kg-1 day-1) significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 6, interleukin 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, in the colon. Algal oil restored the CS-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis by elevating some short-chain-fatty-acid-producing bacteria, e.g., Ruminococcus and Blautia. The CS-induced metabolic disorder was also regulated by algal oil, which was characterized by the modulations of tryptophan metabolism, phospholipid metabolism, and bile acid metabolism. Our results suggested that supplementation of algal oil could alleviate inflammation and promote mucosal healing, which could be a functional food ingredient to protect aganist antibiotic-induced alteration of gut microbiota and metabolic dysbiosis.										2021	69	32	9124	9136	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07323					FSTA:2021-12-Nh2901

Journal of Food Science					A novel deodorization method of edible oil by using ethanol steam at low-temperature was developed. We compared the chemical changes in predeodorized rapeseed oil after anhydrous ethanol steam distillation at low temperature (140 to 220 °C) (L-ESD) and conventional high-temperature (250 °C) water-steam distillation (H-WSD) in terms of odor characteristics, physicochemical properties, micronutrient contents, antioxidant performance, and fatty acid composition. Compared with H-WSD (250 °C for 60 min), L-ESD at 180 °C for 80 to 100 min resulted in lower response values of electronic nose, free fatty acid (0.03% to 0.07%), and peroxide value (0.00 to 0.67 meq/kg), but higher retention of tocopherols (554.93 to 551.59 mg/kg), total phenols (43.36 to 45.42 mgGAE/kg), total carotenoids (65.78 to 67.85 mg/kg), phytosterols (585.80 to 596.53 mg/100 g), polyunsaturated fatty acids (27.95 to 28.01%), and better antioxidant properties. In conclusion, L-ESD can mitigate the damage of oil and thus significantly improve the safety of vegetable oils with a high retention of nutrients compared with conventional H-WSD. Practical Application. The present study aimed to compare the chemical changes in predeodorized rapeseed oil after anhydrous ethanol steam distillation at low temperature (140 to 220 °C) (L-ESD) and conventional high-temperature (250 °C) water-steam distillation (H-WSD) in terms of odor characteristics, physicochemical properties, micronutrient contents, antioxidant performance, and fatty acid composition. Results indicated that this finding supplies a theoretical basis for developing a method with retaining more micronutrients and producing less harmful substances for the deodorization of rapeseed oil. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	2	394	403	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15578					FSTA:2021-05-Ne1181

Food Analytical Methods					Among the methods of detecting food adulteration, the PCR amplification techniques of the endogenous reference gene are increasingly significant. In this article, the improved SDS-CTAB is chosen for the DNA extraction of Flammulina velutipes, the tre6P Phosphatase gene (Tps2) is selected an endogenous reference gene suitable to identify agricultural important fungus F. velutipes and by-products via PCR methods. The Tps2 gene was assayed in 2 varieties of F. velutipes and 9 non-F. velutipes species by both qualitative and quantitative PCR, no amplicon was captured in the non-F. velutipes species. By SYBR Green quantitative PCR, the melting curve showed that the target Tps2 sequence displayed high homogeneity in different F. velutipes varieties. In Taqman probe quantitative PCR analysis, the detection limit was as low as 3 pg/uL of DNA template. From what is said in the foregoing, we can conclude that the Tps2 gene is a reliable, convenient, and accurate endogenous reference gene for detecting F. velutipes component, even in the processed food products, such as sauce and biscuits. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	10	2152	2160	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02043-y					FSTA:2022-06-Jq7855
J		Chen Zhang; Jingjing Li; Li Chen; Xiangzhu Shi; Bingdian Chen; Xucong Lv; Li Ni							Effects of alkali, enzymes, and ultrasound on monosodium glutamate byproduct for a sustainable production of Bacillus subtilis.		Food Chemistry					Due to the hindrance of flocculated polymers and bacterial cell wall, the production of Bacillus subtilis using monosodium glutamate byproduct (MSGB) was low. With the assistance of scanning electron microscope images, effects of alkali, lysozyme, papain, ultrasound, and their combinations on MSGB were evaluated using the results of soluble protein, carbohydrate, monosaccharides and peptidoglycans. Alkali could dissolve flocculated polymers increasing 21% soluble MSGB, and thus enhanced the subsequent treatments (ultrasound, lysozyme, or papain) to increase 14-17% soluble MSGB. As ultrasound mainly released intercellular components (mannose, and glucose) while lysozyme or papain mainly released cell wall components (peptidoglycans), the combination of alkali, ultrasound, and enzymes led to a highest soluble MSGB (78%), yielding a maximal B. subtilis production of 6.6*109 colony-forming units mL-1. This yield was about 33 times that of using untreated MSGB, and the key to improve B. subtilis production was the release of carbohydrate.

Food Hydrocolloids					An aqueous suspension of native potato starch (PS)/xanthan gum (XG) mixture was subjected to physical treatments, including critical melting (mild heating, MH; partial gelatinization, PG) and freeze-thawing (FT) treatments. The Physical treatments significantly changed the morphology, pasting, and structural characteristics of potato starch compared with the simple aqueous blending of PS and XG. Microscopy revealed that the starch granules partially melted and some of the melted granules aggregated into a cluster after critical melting and FT treatment. The overall intensity of X-ray diffraction peaks and relative crystallinity also decreased obviously after treatment, indicating partial disruption of the starch inner structure. Both XG addition and physical treatment decreased the solubility index, swelling power, and water holding capacity of starch after physical treatments. Moreover, the final viscosity (from 2988 to about 5000 mPa s) and shear stability (from 3542 to about 200 mPa s) of starch paste were substantially increased by the physical treatments. The critical melting caused the leaching of soluble starch, which induced the formation of starch/XG aggregate matrix attached to the surface of starch granules during FT treatment, contributing to the starch property modification. While the formation of these matrices might also be the reason for the increased thickness of the starch semi-crystalline lamellar structure.

Food Hydrocolloids					Aqueous dispersion (40% w/w, dry basis) of different starches (corn, potato, and tapioca), with or without xanthan gum (0.1% w/w, based on starch solids), were partial gelatinizated for 1 h at 5 °C above the onset temperatures of starch and cooled (GC), freeze-thawed (FT), and then dried at 60 °C. The combined treatments (GCFT) raised the viscosity and shear stability of starch pastes. Among the starches tested, potato starch exhibited the greatest changes in the pasting behavior. In addition, the physical treatments (GCFT) improved the gelation behavior and the stability against repeated freeze-thawing cycles. A minor addition of xanthan gum enhanced the effect of physical treatments, especially on the stabilization of starch gels.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Monascus fermentation byproduct (MFB) is a biowaste generated after food colorants are extracted. Using MFB to produce probiotics (Bacillus subtilis) is a sustainable way for the entire production to be used as food or animal feed additives. However, due to the rigidity of the Monascus mycelium cell wall, B. subtilis cannot sufficiently utilize the nutrients in MFB, leading to low biomass production efficiency. We studied the effects of ultrasonic treatment, papain, beta-glucanase, and chitosanase, and their combinations on improving the levels of soluble components from MFB. The effects of these treatments on mycelium cell walls were visualized using scanning electron microscopy, and their influence on B. subtilis production was analyzed. Results. Ultrasonic treatment increased the soluble components by 210gkg-1, including 50gkg-1 protein and 120gkg-1 carbohydrates. An enzyme mixture increased the soluble components by 160gkg-1, including 30gkg-1 protein and 90gkg-1 carbohydrates. The combination of the two methods achieved the highest increase of soluble components (up to 400gkg-1) leading to a maximum B. subtilis production of 1*1011 colony-forming unit mL-1. This yield was about 20 times greater than that using untreated MFB and about eight times greater than treatments using only ultrasonic or enzymatic methods. Conclusion. The productivity of B. subtilis production using MFB as the sole medium can be greatly improved by ultrasound or enzymes, which cause the release of intercellular components or cell wall components. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3836	3842	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11018					FSTA:2021-10-Jq12942

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Pulsed electric field (PEF) was efficient in inactivating lipase in wheat grains. To understand the modification in wheat components, the functional, rheological, and structural properties of vital wheat gluten (VWG) were evaluated after PEF treatment. The results showed that the PEF parameters, electric field intensity (EFI), pulse frequency, pulse width, and material residence time significantly (P < 0.01) affected the solubility, water-holding capacity, oil-holding capacity, foaming capacity, foam stability, and emulsion stability to different extents. The transition temperature and denaturation enthalpy of gluten protein decreased significantly (P < 0.01). The elastic modulus, viscous modulus, tandelta of the wet gluten protein, and the apparent viscosity of VWG changed slightly; however, they changed significantly (P < 0.05) with the increase in EFI. Larger EFIs resulted in a more homogeneously condensed and evenly distributed wet gluten pore. The proportion of alpha-helices and beta-sheets had decreased and increased with the increase in EFI, respectively, while the proportion of random coils changed insignificantly (P > 0.05). The amount of free and total sulfhydryl increased and decreased significantly (P < 0.01) with an increase in EFI, respectively. Surface hydrophobicity was significantly reduced (P < 0.01).

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Effects of different wheat bran pre-treatments on storage stability and physico-chemical properties of semi-dried whole wheat noodles (SWWN) were investigated. After bran pre-treatment with liquor koji and yeast, the total plate count of SWWN showed a slower rate of growth and the shelf-life was prolonged, which could be related to the lower pH and higher content of ethanol in noodles. Furthermore, liquor koji and yeast fermentation (LKYF) treatment reduced the optimal cooking time and cooking loss and increased the hardness of SWWN (P< 0.05). The appearance and cross-sectional microstructure of noodles in LKYF changed obviously. Irregular pores in noodles were observed by SEM, which were caused by the gas production during noodle processing. This change had positive effects on the cooking quality and texture property of noodles. The present study showed that bran treatment with LKYF could improve the storage stability and quality characteristics of SWWN.

J		Chenang Lyu; Feifeng Lu; Zhentao Shi; Dapeng Wang							Detection of group A rotavirus in oyster tissues by in situ capture RT-qPCR.		Food Control					Group A rotavirus (RVA) is the major foodborne pathogen that could be transferred via oysters. There are limitations of current methods for detecting rotavirus in oysters, such as the long duration of the traditional cell culture-based plaque assay, the false positive due to the free RNA using RT-PCR-based molecular methods, and the complex process of RNA extraction from the food matrix. Therefore, we developed a PGM-mediated in situ capture reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ISC-RT-qPCR) assay to investigate the encapsulated RVA in oysters. In parallel comparing tests for the cell-cultured viral samples, the ISC-RT-qPCR exhibited 10-fold greater sensitivity and better accuracy of distinguishing the encapsulated RVA than RT-qPCR. Furthermore, the ISC-RT-qPCR demonstrated a higher detection rate than RT-qPCR when applied to detect RVA in the artificially contaminated oyster. In practical application, the detection rates of RVA in oysters collected from four different farms were respectively higher by ISC-RT-qPCR (37.9%, 28.6%, 27.3%, and 0.0%) than by RT-qPCR (0.0%, 13.8%, 4.5%, and 0.0%), making the ISC-RT-qPCR a better assay for disease monitoring and control. Overall, all results indicate that ISC-RT-qPCR is a promising method for detecting encapsulated RVA in oysters and simplifies the steps of virus concentration, virus extraction with higher sensitivity and accuracy than the conventional RT-qPCR assay.

Johnsonii 3-1 and L. crispatus 7-4, were isolated from the feces of wild Gallus gallus, which exhibited obvious anti-pathogenic activity and improved the growth performance of broilers. Furthermore, we found that these two strains participated in the lipid metabolism of broilers by reducing the content of TC and TG in ileal epithelial cells and up-regulating the liver AMPKalpha/PPARalpha/CPT-1 pathway, which affects abdominal fat deposition. In summary, L. Johnsonii 3-1 and L. crispatus 7-4 have the potential to be used as AGP substitutes and participate in the lipid metabolism of broilers to reduce abdominal fat deposition. Importantly, our study reveals for the first time that L. crispatus participates in liver lipid metabolism to reduce abdominal fat deposition in broilers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	24	12535	12549	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03209g					FSTA:2022-04-Sn1833

Food Chemistry					A novel copper hydroxy phosphate@MOF composite DMP-Cu decorated by 2,5-dimercapto-1,3, 4-thiadiazol was facilely prepared and characterized. A dispersive SPE strategy using DMP-Cu as adsorbent combined with atomic fluorescence spectroscopy was developed for the selective capture of trace total mercury in rice sample. The adsorption mechanism showed that the Hg2+ removal process was fitted with pseudo second-order kinetics and the Langmuir adsorption model. The adsorbent was easy to be regenerated and the maximum adsorption capacity for the removal of Hg2+ was 249.5 mg g-1 at the optimal pH of 4. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectra verified the selective and strong interaction between Hg2+ and thiol/nitrogen-containing functional groups of DMTZ on DMP-Cu. The trace total mercury in rice samples was determined with detection limit of 0.0125 ng mL-1 and relative standard deviation below 6%. The high recoveries were obtained in range of 98.8-109% for the spiked rice samples.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The conventional drying technology prolongs the shelf life of carrots but may cause the serious loss of nutrients. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of intermittently rearranging layers on the heating uniformity, drying characteristics and quality of carrot slices under the hot air assisted radio frequency (RF) heating. The carrot slices were dried for 270 min using hot air (60 °C) assisted RF heating at the electrode gap of 100 mm firstly, and then followed hot air drying to achieve the final moisture level (0.11 kg/kg (d.b.)). The results showed that the selected hot air assisted RF drying protocol for the carrot slices reduced 30% of the duration compared to the single hot air drying. The carrot slices dried by the combined drying method had the highest total carotenoid value (P≤0.05) except for possessing accepted color and rehydration. Therefore, the combined drying method could improve the drying rate and maintain heat sensitive substances in carrot slices.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Because the probiotic and growth characteristics of probiotics are strain-specific features, it is crucial to be able to distinguish the probiotic strains from the other strains in the same species. To rapidly identify Lactobacillus rhamnosus at the strain level through PCR, a method for searching for several strain-specific sequences in the genome of a strain was investigated. The whole genomes of L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 and L. rhamnosus LV108 were sequenced, and gene family analysis was performed with using L. rhamnosus GG and L. rhamnosus Lc705 as reference strains. Thirty-one and 19 strain-specific open reading frames (ORFs) were found in L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 and L. rhamnosus LV108, respectively. Thus, strain-specific primer pairs could be designed in a more rational and controllable manner. Concatenation of several strain-specific primer pairs designed from the strain-specific ORFs (and their adjacent regions) were able to distinguish L. rhamnosus LV108 (primer pairs V2, V4, V5, and V9) or L. rhamnosus hsryfm 1301 (primer pairs H1, H2, H3, and H4) from 12 other L. rhamnosus strains. This strain-specific identification method was determined to be accurate, rapid, economical, reproducible and easy to perform.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					PSPP-1 was obtained from purple sweet potato, and the effects of PSPP-1 on the immune modulation on macrophage cells were investigated for the first time. PSPP-1 promoted RAW264.7 proliferation and increased the total cell percentage in DNA synthesis and mitosis phases, and the cell morphology changed in volume and appearance. Additionally, the RAW264.7 immune functions of phagocytic activity and nitric oxide, reactive oxygen species, and cytokine production were improved by PSPP-1. The western blot experiment showed that PSPP-1 could activate toll-like receptor 2 and toll-like receptor 4-mediated pathways, and the expressions of proteins in MyD88-dependent, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling, NF-kappaB-signaling, AP-1 signaling, and TRIF-dependent pathways were improved markedly. Molecular docking and Biolayer Interferometry study further indicated that PSPP-1 could recognize and bind TLR2 and TLR4 by targeting the binding sites with a strong affinity. It suggested that PSPP-1 could enhance immunity via TLR2-and TLR4-mediated pathways, and it could be explored as an immunomodulatory agent.										2021	69	32	9313	9325	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03850					FSTA:2021-12-Jk16499

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study focused on the covalent/noncovalent interaction between glycosylated whey protein isolate (gWPI) and tannic acid (TA) in stabilizing Pickering emulsions. The binary complex of gWPI was fabricated by protein and carbohydrate through the Maillard reaction, the interaction type of the covalent bond between the gWPI and TA was successfully prepared via an alkaline method to form the protein-carbohydrate-polyphenol ternary complex. Fluorescence spectrum results proved that the covalent bond between whey protein isolate (WPI)/gWPI and TA was stronger than the noncovalent bond. The covalent combination of TA strongly affected the fluorescence quenching of WPI and gWPI. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the combination of the WPI/gWPI and TA led to changes in the secondary structure of the protein, the covalent interaction between them caused hydrogen bonds and C-O and C-N stretching vibrations. The covalent interaction in ternary complex between gWPI and TA reduced the particle size of Pickering emulsions and improved the thermal, salt ion, and storage stabilities of Pickering emulsions.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To verify the role of lysosomal Fe2+ in mitochondrial-dysfunction-mediated apoptosis and postmortem tenderization of bovine muscles, mitochondrial apoptotic factors, myofibrillar protein degradation, and mu-calpain activity were evaluated in the control group and the iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) group. The control group showed 1) increased mitochondrial swelling and lipid peroxidation by 47% and 36% at 72 h, respectively (P< 0.05), significantly higher than the DFO group at 12-24 h and 72-168 h (P< 0.05); 2) significantly increased mitochondrial Ca2+ influx at 12-24 h (P< 0.01); 3) a 15%, 24%, and 30% lower cytochrome c reduction level than the DFO group at 6-24 h (P< 0.01, P< 0.05); 4) a significantly increased caspase-3 expression level at 0-120 h (P< 0.05), where the caspase-3 activity was 30% and 49% higher than that of the DFO group at 12-24 h, respectively (P< 0.01); 5) an increased mu-calpain activity by 56% at 24-168 h (P< 0.05), and 6) 75% (P< 0.01) and 34% (P< 0.05) higher degradation of desmin and troponin-T than the DFO group at 168 h, respectively.

Food Chemistry					Green tea nanoparticles (gTNPs) are considered as the precursors of tea cream, while the role of gTNPs in the process of tea cream formation remains obscure. This study indicated that gTNPs could be coated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG)-caffeine (CAF) complexes to form a ternary aggregate participating in tea cream formation. First, the zeta-potentials of gTNPs and EGCG-CAF complexes were adjusted by charge screening. Then, gTNPs were introduced into EGCG+ CAF mixture solutions under different zeta-potential conditions to examine their effect on turbidity, particle size and components of mixture solutions. Finally, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was applied to investigate the influence of gTNPs on the thermal effects of the interaction between EGCG and CAF. Our results reveal that hydrophobic interaction exceeded electrostatic repulsion to dominate the interaction between gTNPs and EGCG-CAF complexes at the low zeta-potential condition, thus forming the gTNPs/EGCG/CAF ternary aggregate.

Food Research International					Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) and methylxanthines are representative bioactive compounds in tea leaves, the strong affinity between them will elicit destruction of tea quality. In order to elucidate the mechanism of complexation between EGCg and methylxanthines, we compared the bindings of theophylline and caffeine to EGCg by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), molecular docking and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The results revealed that the stoichiometries of caffeine to EGCg and theophylline to EGCg were both 1:1. Caffeine and theophylline were captured in the hydrophobic space formed by aromatic rings of EGCg. The affinity between EGCg and caffeine was stronger than that between EGCg and theophylline, which could be partially attributed to the two extra CH-pi interactions between N7-Me of caffeine and aromatic rings of EGCg. Furthermore, the results of ITC were agreed well with NMR and molecular docking, indicating that ITC was possible to accurately evaluate the complexation.

J		Cheng Li; Yiming Hu							Effects of acid hydrolysis on the evolution of starch fine molecular structures and gelatinization properties.		Food Chemistry					Effects of acid hydrolysis on amylose molecular structures and their relations to starch gelatinization properties were investigated. First-order kinetics models were applied to fit the evolution curve of starch chain-length and molecular size by acid hydrolysis treatment. Results showed that a single hydrolysis phase was involved in the degradation of waxy maize starch chains, while two distinct phases existed for the degradation of maize, high amylose maize and sago starch chains. The fast hydrolysis phase involved degradation of amylose chains with DP > ~300 and amylopectin long intra-cluster branches, while amylose chains with DP < ~300 was involved in the slow hydrolysis phase. Amylose molecules with DP ~ 300 were proposed to impact starch gelatinization properties by interaction with cut-off amylopectin double helices and formation of amylose crystallites/entanglements. This study could help food industry precisely control amylose molecular structures by acid hydrolysis treatment to develop starchy foods with desirable properties.

J		Cheng Li; Bo Gong							Relations between rice starch fine molecular and lamellar/crystalline structures.		Food Chemistry					Starch lamellar and crystalline structures are important controller of its physicochemical and digestion properties. Here, starch lamellar/crystalline structures of 16 different rice starches were investigated and correlated with their chain-length distributions (CLDs) and molecular size distributions. Results showed that the thickness of amorphous lamellae was mainly correlated with the amount of amylose short and medium chains. Thickness of both amorphous and crystalline lamellae was negatively correlated with the amount of amylopectin medium chains and relative length of amylopectin short chains. The degree of crystallinity was negatively correlated with the amount of amylose short and long chains. The lamellar ordering, fractal nature and thickness polydispersity were also related to the starch CLDs. Whereas, starch molecular size distributions were shown to be lack of correlations with the starch lamellar/crystalline structures. This study helps a better understanding of the molecular nature of starch semi-crystalline lamellae.

J		Cheng Li; Yiming Hu							A kinetics-based decomposition approach to reveal the nature of starch asymmetric gelatinization thermograms at non-isothermal conditions.		Food Chemistry					Starch gelatinization under non-isothermal conditions with limited moisture content is a common industrial process involved in the processing of many starchy foods, while the nature of its asymmetric differential scanning calorimetry thermograms is still undefinable. This study for the first time developed a kinetics-based mathematical model, which could yield a parameterization of gelatinization thermograms that are essentially the same as experimental ones. Even more, the model is capable of decomposing gelatinization thermograms into kinetics-based sub-patterns, and revealing hidden features. By applying this newly developed methodology to nine starches with different plant origins and correlated with their lamellar structures, the results indicated that distinctly arranged groups (sub-components) of semi-crystalline lamellae with different thermal stabilities are existed in the native starch granules. This gives ways to better understand starch structure-property relations, and suggests useful directions for food manufactures to produce functional foods by understanding and differentially controlling the starch gelatinization sub-components.

J		Cheng Li; Yiming Hu; Fangting Gu; Bo Gong							Causal relations among starch fine molecular structure, lamellar/crystalline structure and in vitro digestion kinetics of native rice starch.		Food & Function					Native rice starch is a source of slowly digestible starch in e.g. low-moisture baked products, while the molecular and lamellar/crystalline structure giving rise to this low-digestibility property is still largely unknown. In this study, the in vitro digestion kinetics of 11 rice starches with a wide range of amylose content were investigated. Applying the logarithm of slope (LOS) plot to the starch digestograms suggested that only a single first-order kinetics phase existed. More importantly, results for the first time showed that rice starches with shorter amylopectin short chains (DP 10-26) had more perfectly aligned crystalline lamellae and much slower digestion rates than the other starches. Interestingly, no correlations were found between the starch lamellar thicknesses with its digestion rate. It suggests that lamellar perfection plays a dominant role in the determination of native starch digestibility. Furthermore, starches with relatively shorter amylose short and medium chains showed a significantly higher amount of V-type amylose-lipid complex, and smaller maximum digestion extent. These results could help the rice industry develop a new generation of rice products with slower starch digestion rate and more desirable nutritional values. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	2	682	695	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02934c					FSTA:2021-06-Me3082

Food Hydrocolloids					Understanding the characteristics of long-term starch retrogradation is critical for developing functional foods with desirable textural attributes. The long-term retrogradation kinetics of 10 different rice starches with a wide range of amylose content were thus investigated in this study, focusing on their relations with the starch chain-length distributions (CLDs). Correlation analysis between the retrogradation parameters from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) with starch CLDs showed for the first time that the amylose content had a parabolic relationship with the melting conclusion temperature and enthalpy of long-term retrograded starches, indicating that the amylose component has a bi-directional effect on the long-term amylopectin retrogradation property. Furthermore, the amount of amylose short-medium chains and amylopectin medium chains were negatively and positively correlated with the melting onset temperature of long-term retrograded starches, respectively. The information learnt from this study could be applied in the rice industry to improve the textural attributes of cooked rice.

J		Cheng Li; Yiming Hu							Antagonistic effects of amylopectin and amylose molecules on the starch inter- and intramolecular interactions during retrogradation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Starch retrogradation property is critical for developing functional foods with desirable nutritional and textural attributes, while its nature currently remains elusive. The current study investigated the relations between starch chain-length distributions (CLDs) and interaction patterns (i.e. intermolecular versus intramolecular interactions) of starch molecules during the retrogradation process. CLDs for different waxy potato and sago starch mixtures were characterized by size-exclusion chromatography, and molecular interactions were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and small amplitude oscillatory shear rheological test. Results for the first time showed that amylose molecules were involved in the formation of short-range intermolecular interactions with amylopectin molecules. Most intermolecularly heterogenous double helices were formed at the 1: 1 mixing ratio of waxy potato to sago starch. Although the addition of waxy potato starch to sago starch increased the overall amount of short-range double helices, the amount of short-range intermolecular double helices was decreased. It suggests that there was an antagonistic effect between the formation of short-range inter-and intramolecular double helices. These results help a better understanding of the interaction patterns of amylose and amylopectin molecules during the retrogradation process.

Journal of Food Safety					Lac dye, a kind of food additive and textile dye, is extracted from lac insect secretions. The ability of lac dye to stain bacteria was firstly found. Based on the discovery, a new bidirectional lateral flow immunoassay strip (BLFIS) for detecting Escherichia coli O157:H7 (E. coli O157:H7) was successfully developed. The BLFIS has two sheets of nitrocellulose (NC) membranes separated by a sample pad. The anti-E. coli O157:H7 monoclonal antibodies (McAb) were oppositely dispensed on the NC membranes as the control line and test line, respectively. On the side of the control line, a conjugation pad immobilized with pre-stained E. coli O157:H7 was assembled. The detection limit of BLFIS was 106 CFU/ml. Furthermore, after pre-incubation in food sample, the detection sensitivity was significantly increased to 100 colonies of the initial bacterial count. This method may be an improvement over traditional colloidal gold lateral flow immunoassay strips, which does not require the pairing of two antibodies to complete the detection, nor the chromogenic nanomaterials to report the detection results, such as gold nanoparticles. And the BLFIS might provide technical support for detecting E. coli O157:H7 in food and ensuring food safety. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	1			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12862					FSTA:2021-06-Pa2913

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The naringinase, a desirable candidate for citrus juice debittering, consists of alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase. This study aimed to elucidate the effects of alpha-L-rhamnosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, and their combination on naringin, polyphenols, antioxidant activity, and aroma quality. The alpha-L-rhamnosidase and the two enzymes combination reduced the naringin concentration from 356.33 to 10.52 and 4.17 mg/L, respectively. The alpha-L-rhamnosidase, beta-D-glucosidase, and their combination significantly increased the antioxidant activity. The unpleasant cooking note was significantly weakened and the floral note was increased after three treatments. The combinational treatment increased the sweet note greatly. The substrate competition between alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase may help to explain the inconsistencies of the polyphenols, antioxidant activity, and aroma quality after single enzyme or combined enzymes treatments. The results indicated that taste, antioxidant activity, and aromatic quality were well improved by the combined treatment than either alpha-L-rhamnosidase or beta-D-glucosidase treatment, providing an attractive reference for debittering orange juice. Practical applications. The work showed that the combined treatment of alpha-L-rhamnosidase and beta-D-glucosidase was better to remove the bitter taste of citrus juice than the solo treatment with alpha-L-rhamnosidase or beta-D-glucosidase in regarding with taste, antioxidant activity, and aromatic quality.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					During preservation of nuts, nut oils are easily oxidized; hence, peroxide value (PV) is an important evaluation index. In this study, a novel method for the determination of the PV of nuts based on partial-least-square regression (PLSR) and Forest random PLSR (RF-PLSR) model was established. Meanwhile, the Raman spectrum was processed by 24 spectral pretreatment methods to transform the whole Raman band, and the best band was selected by RF method. Among the whole bands, 36 wavenumbers were selected to establish the PLSR model. The R-square of the correction set (R2c) and prediction set (R2p) of the optimal Standard normal variate transformation + first Derivative-PLSR model and RF-PLSR were 0.9552, 0.8672, 0.8048, and 0.7927, while the root-mean-square error of calibration (RMSEC) and prediction (RMSEP) were 0.067, 0.1100, 0.1514, and 0.1547, respectively.

Journal of Food Science					To facilitate the production of tomato products with high bioactivity and improve the utilization of orange-colored tomatoes, the carotenoids of 11 tomato cultivars were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection. Moreover, antioxidant activities were evaluated by four chemical-based assays, and the influences of thermal treatment on the carotenoids in orange-colored tomatoes rich in tetra-cis (7 Z, 9 Z, 7′ Z, and 9′ Z)-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene were studied. The nine orange-colored tomatoes (OT) were divided into two categories: OT-B, containing five cultivars rich in beta-carotene, and OT-L, containing the other four cultivars that were abundant in tetra-cis-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene. The antioxidant activities of OT-L were higher than those of OT-B and the SD-2 cultivar in OT-L showed similar antioxidant activity to the red tomatoes. During thermal processing, tetra-cis-lycopene in SD-2 decreased about 38% after being exposed to heat for 2 hr at 80 °C, while its content was still higher than other lycopene isomers. Other-Z-lycopenes and all-trans (E)-lycopene increased from 2.36 0.19 to 14.73 1.16 g/g fresh weight (FW) and 0.75 0.10 to 5.91 1.02 g/g FW, respectively. Thus, thermal treatments at lower temperature, such as cold break and pasteurization, were more suitable for processing OT-L. The results demonstrated that OT-L could be an excellent raw material to produce tomato products with high bioavailability and bioactivity. The results of this research could provide helpful information for the research and development of tomato products using orange tomatoes and benefit planters and consumers. Practical Application. Some orange tomato cultivars are promising raw materials for tomato products because of their high contents of bioactive tetra-cis-lycopene, phytofluene, and phytoene. This study demonstrated the carotenoid components and antioxidant activities of the widely planted orange-colored tomatoes in China. The obtained knowledge, including the thermal processing effects on the isomerization and degradation of carotenoids in the cultivars, will offer useful information to food processors and benefit the consumers. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	5	1751	1765	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15682					FSTA:2021-09-Jj11577

Effect of diet and nonesterified fatty acid levels on global transcriptomic profiles in circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells in early lactation dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					After calving, lipid mobilization caused by increased nutrient demands for lactation leads to elevated circulating concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA). Excessive NEFA levels have previously been identified as a major risk factor for postpartum immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to investigate changes in global transcriptomic gene expression of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in dairy cows offered different early lactation diets (high concentrate, n = 7; medium, n = 8; or low, n = 9) and with differing circulating levels of NEFA. Cows were classified as having NEFA concentrations of either <500 M (low, n = 6), 500 to 750 M (medium, n = 8) or >750 M (high, n = 10) at 14 d in milk. Plasma urea concentrations were greater for cows on the high concentrate diet but beta-hydroxybutyrate and glucose concentrations did not differ significantly between either dietary treatments or NEFA groups. Cows with high NEFA weighed more at drying off and suffered greater body condition score loss after calving. The PBMC were isolated at 14 d in milk, and RNA was extracted for RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression was analyzed with DESeq2 with q-value for false discovery rate control followed by Gene Ontology Enrichment. Although there were no differentially expressed genes associated with lactation diet, 304 differentially expressed genes were identified between cows with high and low circulating NEFA, with 118 upregulated and 186 downregulated. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis demonstrated that biological adhesion and immune system process were foremost among various PBMC functions which were altered relating to body defenses and immunity. High NEFA concentrations were associated with inhibited cellular adhesion function by downregulating 20 out of 26 genes (by up to 17-fold) related to this process. Medium NEFA concentrations altered a similar set of functions as high NEFA, but with smaller enrichment scores. Localization and immune system process were most significant, with biological adhesion ranking only eleventh. Our results demonstrated that increased circulating NEFA concentrations, but not diet, were associated with immune system processes in PBMC in early lactation cows. Leukocyte cell-to-cell adhesion was inhibited when the NEFA concentration exceeded 750 M, which would reduce the efficiency of diapedesis and so contribute to decreased body defense mechanisms and predispose animals to infection.

G.; Ruijin Yang							Effects of combined pulsed electric field and blanching pretreatment on the physiochemical properties of French fries.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The aim of this work was to explore the effect of combining pulsed electric field (PEF) with blanching pretreatment on the physiochemical properties of French fries. The effects of PEF plus blanching pretreatment on the color parameters, texture, content and spatial distribution of moisture and oil, microstructure, colony count and acrylamide content of French fries were investigated. Results. Showed that the pretreated French fries were brighter (L value was 60.44) and golden yellow, with lower hardness (312.27 g), higher springiness (0.81) and higher chewiness (119.71). In addition, moisture and oil contents of the fries were reduced, with more uniform distributions. The cross-section microstructure of these French fries also showed near-complete gelatinization of starch particles, and the internal structure of fries was fluffy. Finally, French fries obtained by the combined pretreatment had an improved food safety profile, with a lower colony count (13 CFU/g) and acrylamide content (1533.75 ng/g). Industrial relevance Blanching is a traditional thermal processing technology widely used in the field of fried potatoes. However, blanching has some disadvantages such as slow heat conduction, long processing time, substantial loss of soluble nutrients, and huge water wastage. PEF is an emerging technology in the 21st century that can maintain the original flavor, color, taste, and nutritional value of foods treated by it. The French fries obtained by combining PEF and blanching pretreatment were brighter and golden yellow, and were also softer, and more springy and chewy-an overall net improvement in aesthetic appeal and organoleptic profile. The above findings may provide useful information to guide effective strategies for the practical application of PEF combined with blanching in the preparation of fried potato foods.

J		Cheng Zhang; Wei Zhao; Wenxu Yan; Mingming Wang; Yanjun Tong; Mi Zhang; Ruijin Yang							Effect of pulsed electric field pretreatment on oil content of potato chips.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The purpose of this work was to reduce the oil content of potato chips by the pulsed electric field (PEF) pretreatment. The effects of PEF on oil content, color parameters, texture, microstructure, and acrylamide content of potato chips were investigated. The following appropriate pulse parameters were selected for pretreatment: the number of pulses was 2000, the pulse width was 5 mus, the frequency was 20 Hz, and pulse direction was unidirectional pulse. The results showed that the electric field strength had a significant effect on the oil content and texture of potato chips. When pretreating the potato slices under the electric field strength of 10 kV/cm, the oil content of potato chips was reduced by 21.2%, and the hardness and crispness were significantly improved. The surface of the potato chips became smoother, and the porosity in the cross-section increased, which might be the reason for the reduced oil content of the potato chips. Finally, the potato chips prepared in current experiment had a low acrylamide content, approximately 10 ng/g (fresh weight). The above findings may provide useful information to guide the effective strategies for the practical application of PEF in reducing the oil content of fried foods.

J		Cheng Zhong; Zijing Liu; Xuyu Zhang; Youwei Pu; Zhongwei Yang; Yixi Bao							Physicochemical properties of polysaccharides from Ligusticum chuanxiong and analysis of their anti-tumor potential through immunoregulation.		Food & Function					We investigated the extraction, purification, physicochemical properties and biological activity of Ligusticum chuanxiong polysaccharides (LCXPs). Two polysaccharide fractions (Ligusticum chuanxiong [LCX] P-1a and LCXP-3a) were obtained by DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow and SephacrylS-300 high resolution column chromatography. The results showed that the molecular weight of LCXP-1a and LCXP-3a was 11.159 kDa and 203.486 kDa, respectively. LCXP-1a is composed of rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, and glucose at a molar percentage of 0.52 : 1.88 : 1.06 : 95.36, But LCXP-3a has another molar percentage of mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, and fucose of 0.64 : 6.69 : 1.03 : 43.74 : 2.20 : 26.90 : 0.82 : 15.94 : 1.80. Both LCXP-1a and LCXP-3a could stimulate macrophages to produce NO, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-12p70. Co-culturing macrophages and hepatocellular carcinoma cells showed that LCXP-1a and LCXP-3a inhibited the growth of HepG2 and Hep3B through immunoregulation. They arrested the cell cycle at the G0/G1 phase and promoted apoptosis. Moreover, there was no cytotoxicity to the hepatocyte cell line, LO2. We also noted that the immunomodulatory activity and anti-tumor activity of LCXP-3a were significantly better than those of LCXP-1a. Our data demonstrate that LCXP-3a is potentially a well-tolerated and effective immunomodulatory adjuvant cancer treatment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	4	1719	1731	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02978e					FSTA:2021-07-Te2401
J		Cheng-Cheng Lin; Zhi-Ying Xu; Bi-Han Wang; Wen-Yue Zhuang; Jing-Hui Sun; He Li; Jian-Guang Chen; Chun-Mei Wang							Relaxation effect of Schisandra chinensis lignans on the isolated tracheal smooth muscle in rats and its mechanism.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis) is one of the core drugs used for relieving cough and asthma in traditional Chinese medicine. However, there are few basic studies on the treatment of respiratory diseases with S. chinensis in modern pharmacology, and the material basis and mechanism of its antiasthmatic effect are still unclear. Lignans are the main active components of S. chinensis. The aim of this study was to observe the relaxation effect of S. chinensis lignans (SCL) on the tracheal smooth muscle of rats by in vitro tracheal perfusion experiments, and to explore the mechanism by preincubation with L-type calcium channel blocker verapamil, four potassium channel blockers glibenclamide, tetraethylamine, 4-aminopyridine and barium chloride (BaCl2), beta-adrenoceptor blocker propranolol, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nomega-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin, respectively. The results showed that SCL (0.25-1.75mg/mL) reduced the contraction of isolated tracheal smooth muscle induced by acetylcholine, the preincubation with verapamil and glibenclamide could attenuate the relaxation effect, whereas propranolol, 4-aminopyridine, BaCl2, tetraethylamine, L-NAME, and indomethacin had no such effect. These results suggest that SCL has a significant relaxation effect on the isolated tracheal smooth muscle of rats, and the mechanism may be related to the inhibition of extracellular calcium influx and intracellular calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, as well as the activation of ATP-sensitive potassium channels. These findings may provide a pharmacological basis for the traditional use of S. chinensis to treat asthma.										2021	24	8	825	832	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0037					FSTA:2022-02-Jf2160
J		Cheng-Cheng Song; Bian-Wen Qiao; Qin Zhang; Chen-Xin Wang; Ying-Huan Fu; Bei-Wei Zhu							Study on the domain selective inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by food-derived tyrosine-containing dipeptides.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this article, the selective inhibition of several tyrosine-containing dipeptides on N and C domain of ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) was studied, and the interaction mode of ACE and inhibitors was simulated by molecular docking. MTT assay was used to detect the effect of dipeptide on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The results showed that the food-derived dipeptides AY (Ala-Tyr), LY (Leu-Tyr), and IY (Ile-Tyr) containing tyrosine at the C-terminal were favorable structures for selective inhibition of ACE C-domain. These dipeptides showed competitive and mixed inhibition patterns, while the dipeptides EY (Glu-Tyr), RY (Arg-Tyr), FY (Phe-Tyr), and SY (Ser-Tyr) showed noncompetitive inhibition. Food-derived dipeptides containing tyrosine have no cytotoxicity on HUVEC cells, which provides a basis for the application of food-derived tyrosine dipeptides as antihypertensive peptides. This study provides a theoretical basis for exploring the selective inhibition mechanism of ACE inhibitory peptides containing tyrosine residue. Practical applications: Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a two-domain dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase, which is a key enzyme to regulate blood pressure. ACE has two active sites, C- and N-domain, which have high catalytic activity. Although the amino acid sequences of the two active sites have 60% similarity, there are some differences in structure and function. The action mechanism of ACE domain should be clarified, and the structure-activity relationship between inhibitors and ACE domain has not been systematically studied. The aim of this study was to identify the selective inhibitory effect of food-derived tyrosine dipeptides on the domain of ACE. This provides a new idea for finding new antihypertensive drugs with less side effects. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13779					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14624

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. A growing number of studies have reported the effects of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and terrestrial phospholipids on ameliorating mood disorders. Marine-derived EPA-enriched phospholipids (EPA-PL) exhibit the structural characteristics of EPA and phospholipids. However, the effect of dietary EPA-PL, and the differences between amphiphilic EPA-PL and lyophobic EPA on mood disorders had not been studied. Methods and Results. A comparative investigation to determine the effects of dietary EPA-enriched ethyl ester (EPA-EE) and EPA-PL on improving depression-and anxiety-like behavior in a mouse model is performed, induced by 4 week chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) coupled with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge. It is found that dietary 4 week 0.6% (w/w) EPA-PL rescued depression-and anxiety-like behavior to a greater extent than did EPA-EE. Moreover, dietary EPA-PL significantly reduced the immobility time by 56.6%, close to the normal level, in forced swimming test, which revealed a reversal of depression-like behavior. Further studies revealed that dietary EPA-PL regulated immunity, monoamine systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis by multi-target interactions, including inhibition of neuroinflammation and apoptosis. Conclusion. EPA-PL exerted superior effects to EPA-EE in alleviating depression-and anxiety-like behavior. The data suggest potential novel candidate or targeted dietary patterns to prevent and treat mood disorder. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	17			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100009					FSTA:2021-12-Aj18978

J		Cheng-Hai Yan; Xiao-Meng Xun; Jiao Wang; Jin-Zheng Wang; Shuai You; Fu-An Wu; Jun Wang							An alternative solution for alpha-linolenic acid supplements: in vitro digestive properties of silkworm pupae oil in a pH-stat system.		Food & Function					Alpha-Linolenic acid (ALA) is recognised to have a regulatory effect on cardiovascular diseases. Due to the low bioavailability of linseed oil (LINO), which is the most common ALA supplement, it is necessary to find a replacement for ALA supplements that is more easily accepted by the human body. The content of ALA in silkworm pupae oil (SPO) is 32.60 0.67%, and SPO can be substituted as a dietary lipid to meet the demand of the human body. In the present study, a pH-stat system was used to investigate the release degree of free fatty acids (FFAs) from SPO and construct a first-order kinetic model. Digestion experiments in vitro with different lipids showed that the maximum release FFA levels were SPO > SO (soybean oil) > LO (lard oil) > MSO (mulberry seed oil) > LINO, and the first-order kinetic apparent rate constants were LINO > SPO > LO > SO > MSO. Triacylglycerol (TAG) and fatty acid composition are the decisive factors in determining the level of lipid digestion. Therefore, the maximum level of FFAs released from SPO (84.34 1.37%) was much higher than that of LINO (49.78 0.52%) when the hydrolysis rates were 0.2114 s-1 and 0.2249 s-1, respectively. In addition, the smaller emulsion droplet size (609.24 43.46 nm) and weaker surface charge (-17.93 0.42 mV) also resulted in higher levels of SPO under in vitro digestion conditions. Meanwhile, due to low melting and crystallisation temperature, SPO is quickly absorbed by the human body. Overall, SPO can be used as a new alternative for ALA supplements based on its superior digestive properties. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	6	2428	2441	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03469j					FSTA:2021-07-Nh1610
J		Cheng-Han Li; Chun-Hung Hsieh; Cheng-Chu Hung; Ching-Wei Cheng							Nondestructive detection of the gel state of preserved eggs based on dielectric impedance.		Foods					After completing the production of preserved eggs, traditionally, the degree of gelling is judged by allowing workers to tap the preserved eggs with their fingers and sense the resulting oscillations. The amount of oscillation is used for the quality classification. This traditional method produces varying results owing to the differences in the sensitivity of the individual workers, who are not objective. In this study, dielectric detection technology was used to classify the preserved eggs nondestructively. The impedance in the frequency range of 2-300 kHz was resolved into resistance and reactance, and was plotted on a Nyquist diagram. Next, the diagram curve was fitted in order to obtain the equivalent circuit, and the difference in the compositions of the equivalent circuits corresponding to gelled and non-gelled preserved eggs was analyzed. A preserved egg can be considered an RLC series circuit, and its decay rate is consistent with the decay rate given by mechanical vibration theory. The Nyquist diagrams for the resistance and reactance of preserved eggs clearly showed that the resistance and reactance of gelled and non-gelled eggs were quite different, and the classification of the eggs was performed using Bayesian network (BN). The results showed that a BN classifier with two variables, i.e., resistance and reactance, can be used to classify preserved eggs as gelled or non-gelled, with an accuracy of 81.0% and a kappa value of 0.62. Thus, a BN classifier based on resistance and reactance demonstrates the ability to classify the quality of preserved egg gel. This research provides a nondestructive method for the inspection of the quality of preserved egg gel, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of an automated preserved egg inspection system that can be used as the scientific basis for the determination of the quality of preserved eggs. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cheng-Hua Wang; Wu-Ping Xiong; Cheng Huang; Xiao-Ming Li; Qing-Yan Wang; Ri-Bo Huang							Engineering better catalytic activity and acidic adaptation into Kluyveromyces marxianus exoinulinase using site-directed mutagenesis.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Exoinulinase catalyzes the successive removal of individual fructose moiety from the non-reducing end of the inulin molecule, which is useful for biotechnological applications like producing fructan-based non-grain biomass energy and high-fructose syrup. In this study, an exoinulinase (KmINU) from Kluyveromyces marxianus DSM 5418 was tailored for increased catalytic activity and acidic adaptation for inulin hydrolysis processes by rational site-directed mutagenesis. Results. Three mutations, S124Y, N158S and Q215V distal to the catalytic residues of KmINU were designed and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115. Compared to the wild-type, S124Y shifted the pH-activity profile towards acidic pH values and increased the catalytic activity and catalytic efficiency by 59% and 99% to 688.4 17.03s-1 and 568.93 Lmmol-1 s-1, respectively. N158S improved the catalytic activity under acidic pH conditions, giving a maximum value of 464.06 14.06s-1 on inulin at pH 4.5. Q215V markedly improved the substrate preference for inulin over sucrose by 5.56-fold, and showed catalytic efficiencies of 208.82 and 6.88 Lmmol-1 s-1 towards inulin and sucrose, respectively. Molecular modeling and computational docking indicated that structural reorientation may underlie the increased catalytic activity, acidic adaptation and substrate preference. Conclusions. The KmINU mutants may serve as industrially promising candidates for inulin hydrolysis. Protein engineering of exoinulinase here provides a successful example of the extent to which mutating non-conserved substrate recognition and binding residues distal to the active site can be used for industrial enzyme improvements. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2472	2482	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10873					FSTA:2021-07-Bg1020
J		Cheng-Liang Xie; Ki H. Park; Sang S. Kang; Kye M. Cho; Dong H. Lee							Isoflavone-enriched soybean leaves attenuate ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats by anti-inflammatory activity.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. With an increasing aging population, postmenopausal osteoporosis has become a global public health problem. Previous evidence has shown that postmenopausal osteoporosis is a skeletal disease mainly caused by estrogen deficiency, generally accompanied by inflammation, and dietary isoflavones may ameliorate postmenopausal osteoporosis by anti-inflammatory activity. We have generated isoflavone-enriched soybean leaves (IESLs), but their anti-inflammatory activity and effect on attenuating osteoporosis are still obscure. Here, we determined the isoflavone profiles of IESLs and evaluated their anti-inflammatory activity in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells and anti-osteoporotic effects on ovariectomy-induced osteoporosis in rats. Results. IESLs had a high content of total isoflavone. Hydrolysate of IESLs (HIESLs) was rich with the aglycones daidzein and genistein, and HIESLs can significantly inhibit lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation by reducing messenger RNA expression of iNOS, COX-2, IL6, and IL1beta. Moreover, ovariectomized rats receiving aqueous extracts of IESLs (HIESLs) orally maintained more bone mass than control rats did, which was attributed to inhibition of osteoclastogenesis by downregulating the messenger RNA expression of the bone-specific genes RANKL/OPG, OC, and cathepsinK, and the inflammation-related genes IL6, NFkappaB, and COX-2. Conclusion. IESLs may attenuate postmenopausal osteoporosis by suppressing osteoclastogenesis with anti-inflammatory activity and be a potential source of functional food ingredients for the prevention of osteoporosis. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	4	1499	1506	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10763					FSTA:2021-06-Jn7603

Its rapid and reliable detection in food is critical for the effective prevention of the outbreak of foodborne diseases. Here, we report a novel method for the rapid, specific, label-free, and real-time detection of S. enterica with biolayer interferometry (BLI) using an antibody as the receptor. The limit of detection for S. enterica in buffer was 1.6*105 CFU/ml at a binding time of 300s. This method enabled the successful identification of S. enterica in complex food matrices (whole egg powder and beef samples) with satisfactory recovery rates.

Food & Function					Adlay (Coix lachryma-jobi L. var. ma-yuen Stapf) seeds have been used in Asia for thousands years to treat warts, chapped skin, rheumatism, and neuralgia. The anti-allergic activity of dehulled adlay (DA) seeds was identified, and the bran (AB) is regarded as the main functional constituent in the edible part. However, no study has focused on in vivo acute anti-allergic airway inflammation. In the present report, we investigated DA methanolic extract (DAM) reversed ovalbumin (OVA)/methacholine (Mch)-induced airway hypersensitivity, decreased interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels from splenocytes, suppressed tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-13 levels and reduced eosinophil counts and eotaxin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), which imply that the modulatory effects of DA should involve allergic degranulation. Further, seven phytosterols were isolated from AB ethanolic extract (ABE); among them, 3-O-caffeoyl-5beta-sitostan-3-ol, beta-sitosterol 3-O-glucopyranoside and beta-sitosterol inhibited beta-hexosaminidase release from A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells with percentages of 54.1%, 52.0% and 48.5%, respectively, at 50 muM. In addition, beta-sitosterol reduced immunoglobulin (Ig) E-stimulated degranulation on RBL-2H3 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The phytosterols were the predominant components based on gas chromatography (GC) analysis. This is the first study to demonstrate that DA suppressed OVA/Mch-induced acute airway inflammation. The phytosterols in AB showed significant anti-degranulation activities, and may be regarded as the indicative components of AB for anti-allergy effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	24	12788	12799	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01621k					FSTA:2022-04-Mg2032

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The storage and utilization of rice bran are severely impeded due to the rapid rancidity caused by its lipase. However, little research was carried out to explore other factors for rice bran rancidity. In this study, five Bacilli with lipid hydrolysis abilities were isolated from rice bran and then inoculated into sample to explore the influence of microbial contamination on rancidity. Fresh rice bran was divided into four groups, including control group (CG), ultraviolet group (UG), ultraviolet-uninoculated group (UUG) and ultraviolet-five Bacilli inoculated group (UIG). The final microbial amount in UIG was significantly higher than other three groups after 31 days. The rancidity of UG was restrained to 75% compared with CG during storage. And the rancidity of UIG group was accelerated significantly after being inoculated with the five isolated strains. The increase ratio of acid values between CG, UG, UUG and UIG was about 8:6:9:15. The lipase activities performed no significant difference between CG and UG, but UIG and UUG only maintained about 40.0% and 80.0% of lipase activities. In summary, microbial contamination had a non-negligible influence on rice bran rancidity, and controlling the microbial contamination should be fully considered during the processing and preservation of rice bran.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The efficient utilization of rice bran is severely impeded because of the rapid rancidity caused by rice bran lipase, so the investigation of rice bran lipase characteristic and catalytic mechanism was urgently required. The extracted crude proteins from rice bran were purified to obtain two lipases with 16.31 times of purification fold and 10.64% of purification yield. The molecular masses of these two homologous lipases were 34929.00 Da and 34072.00 Da, respectively. Rice bran lipase showed highest catalytic activity at 40.00 °C, pH 7.50 and held good stability below 50.00 °C and at pH 7.00-7.50. Most metal ions (except Na+ and Co+) and organic solvents had significant inhibition effect (P< 0.05) on the purified lipase activity. Surfactants like Tween 80, Triton 100 and sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) decreased the lipase activities significantly (P< 0.05) to 70.88%, 80.08% and 73.74% respectively and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) increased the catalytic activity significantly (P< 0.05) to 109.00%. The Ser-His-Asp residues were speculated to be the catalytic center of purified lipases by using the inhibitors (Phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) and Pepstatin) which aimed at specific amino acids and then verified by molecular docking. Therefore, blocking or destroying the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad might be new choices to restrain the rancidity of rice bran.

International Journal of Food Properties					This study compares the antioxidant capacity of non-sterilized lemon product (NLFP) and sterilized lemon fermented product (LFP). After gastrointestinal simulation reaction, the antioxidant capacity decreased by 50% in lemon juice (LJ), 30%-40% in NLFP, and 40% in LFP respectively. For the bioactive ingredients, sterilized LFP had a polyphenol of 25.8 mg GAE/mL, ascorbic acid of 55.2 mg/mL, and flavonoids of 75.2 mg/L, which were higher than LJ. NLFP and LFP effectively increased the activity of Glutathione Peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS) content. The results in this study indicate that LJ with lactic acid fermentation can increase biologically active ingredients and antioxidant capacity which is important for future development.

After added 5% LWAE the amount of D-limonene in non-sterilized lemon fermented product (NLFP) increased from 10.1% to 20.9%, while that in LFP increase from 10.5% to 19.9%. Besides, anti-browning test results showed that LWAE could delay browning. This study demonstrated that LWAE improved the antioxidant capacity, limonene content, anti-browning ability, and bioactive ingredients in a gastrointestinal simulation. These results may serve as the principal basis for byproduct reuse and improvement of product quality.

Food Bioscience					Soybean protein isolate (SPI) was treated using ultrasound at 400 W for 5 and 15 min at 80 °C. The effects of ultrasound heat treatment on the structure of SPI and properties of glucono-delta-lactone induced SPI cold set gels (GSCG) were investigated. The results showed that ultrasound heat treatment of SPI reduced alpha-helixes and beta-sheets and increased random coils, leading to a less compact tertiary conformation. The increase in surface hydrophobicity and free sulfhydryls changed the particle size of SPI and its gelation properties. However, the formation of GSCG mainly involved hydrophobic interactions rather than disulfide bonds due to the limitation of sulfhydryl group oxidation during acidification. Ultrasound heat treatment of SPI produced GSCG faster and increased the storage/elastic modulus (G′), gel strength and water holding capacity of GSCG, resulting in a more compact and homogeneous microstructure with smaller pores. The 5 min ultrasound heat treated GSCG had higher G′ and gel strength than 15 min, suggesting the synergistic effect of ultrasound and heat treatment. The results suggested that the combination of ultrasound and heat treatment might be an effective method for modifying the structure of SPI and improving the properties of GSCG.

J		Chengbin Zhao; Huanhuan Yin; Jiannan Yan; Xi Niu; Baokun Qi; Jingsheng Liu							Structure and acid-induced gelation properties of soy protein isolate-maltodextrin glycation conjugates with ultrasonic pretreatment.		Food Hydrocolloids					Glycated conjugates were prepared by heating aqueous dispersions of soy protein isolate (SPI) and maltodextrin (MD) after ultrasonic treatment (138 W/cm2, 20 kHz) for 5,15, and 25 min. The effect of the ultrasonic pretreatment on the structure, physicochemical characteristics, and acid-induced gelation properties of the resulting SPI-MD conjugates was investigated. The analyses of free amino groups, degree of graft, intermediates, and browning intensity confirmed the formation of SPI-MD conjugates. The ultrasonic treatment promoted the glycation reaction, which led to the increase in the beta-type ordered secondary structure and less compact tertiary conformation of conjugates. The ultrasonic treatment for 5 min increased the isoelectric point, surface hydrophobicity (H), free sulfhydryl (-SH) groups, and particle size of the conjugates. These changes in the structural and physicochemical properties of the conjugates affected their acid-induced gelation. Glucono-delta-lactone was used to form acid gels at 25 °C. Although the glycation with MD deteriorated the acid-induced gelation properties of SPI, the 5 min ultrasonic conjugates formed gels faster than the untreated conjugate, and their gels exhibited higher storage modulus (G′), gel strength, and water holding capacity (WHC), as well as denser microstructure, than the untreated conjugate gels. However, prolonged ultrasonic treatment (15 or 25 min) weakened the gelation properties of the conjugates by promoting the glycation reaction and reducing the H. Thus, an optimum ultrasonic pretreatment can be used to modify the structure of soy protein glycation conjugates to control their gelation properties.

Journal of Functional Foods					As a degenerative disease, osteoarthritis (OA) has become a worldwide concern. This study aimed at investigating effects of chicken sternal cartilage hydrolysates (CCH) on the prevention of OA, which was established by medial meniscus resection and anterior to medial collateral ligament operation in rat. After the operation, rats were administrated with CCH, mainly including collagen peptides and chondroitin sulfate, for 12weeks. Administration of CCH could inhibit abnormal subchondral bone, and then prevent osteophyte formation in a dose-dependent manner. According to histological analysis, administration of CCH at doses of 200mgkg-1 d-1 and 500mgkg-1 d-1 significantly ameliorated cartilage damage. Moreover, it significantly improved abnormal collagen metabolism, leading to a significant reduction of collagen loss in cartilage. Therefore, this study indicated that CCH may be used as the potential functional food ingredients for OA prevention.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Flavan-3-ols are a group of flavonoids that exert beneficial effects. This study aimed to enhance key metabolic processes related to flavan-3-ols biosynthesis. The engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain E32 that produces naringenin from glucose was further engineered for de novo production of two basic flavan-3-ols, afzelechin (AFZ) and catechin (CAT). Through introduction of flavonoid 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase (DFR), and leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR), de novo production of AFZ and CAT can be achieved. The combination of FaDFR from Fragaria * ananassa and VvLAR from Vitis vinifera was optimal. (GGGGS)2 and (EAAAK)2 linkers between DFR and LAR proved optimal for the production of AFZ and CAT, respectively. Optimization of promoters and the enhanced supply of NADPH further increased the production. By combining the best engineering strategies, the optimum strains produced 500.5 mg/L AFZ and 321.3 mg/L CAT, respectively, after fermentation for 90 h in a 5 L bioreactor. The strategies presented could be applied for a more efficient production of flavan-3-ols by various microorganisms.										2021	69	43	12763	12772	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04489					FSTA:2022-03-Bi0356
J		Chengcheng Wang; Matarneh, S. K.; Gerrard, D.; Tan, J.							Modelling of energy metabolism and analysis of pH variations in postmortem muscle.		Meat Science					A kinetic model structure was developed to describe the major variations in energy metabolism and to gain further understanding of pH changes in postmortem muscle experimentally observed with an in vitro glycolytic system. Comparison with experiments showed that the model could describe the kinetics of major metabolites and pH under varied conditions. Optimized model parameters definitively and consistently showed the observed effects of mitochondria, indicating a desirable level of model complexity. Simulation and analysis of pH variations based on the model suggested that phosphofructokinase activity has the strongest impact on the rate and extent of postmortem pH decline. Postmortem pH is also influenced by rates of ATP hydrolysis and glycolysis, and to a much lesser extent, pH buffering capacity. Other reactions, including those mediated by creatine kinase, adenylate kinase, and AMP deaminase, have minimal effects on postmortem pH decline.

J		Chengcheng Yang; Yao Du; Daoyuan Ren; Xingbin Yang; Yan Zhao							Gut microbiota-dependent catabolites of tryptophan play a predominant role in the protective effects of turmeric polysaccharides against DSS-induced ulcerative colitis.		Food & Function					Gut barrier dysfunction is triggered by gut microbiota dysbiosis that is closely associated with ulcerative colitis. Recently, more attention has been devoted to the ability of the non-digestively colon-targeted plant polysaccharides to regulate the function and composition of the intestinal microbiota. Here, we first studied the prophylactic capacity of turmeric polysaccharides (TPS) to ameliorate dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced gut microbiota imbalance. The results revealed that TPS administration could greatly improve the pathological phenotype, gut barrier disruption and colon inflammation in colitis mice. Besides, targeted metabolomics or 16S rRNA-based microbiota analysis demonstrated that TPS alleviated gut microbiota dysbiosis caused by DSS, especially increasing the abundance of probiotics associated with tryptophan metabolism, such as Lactobacillus and Clostridia-UCG-014, where the cecal tryptophan catabolite indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and its ligand aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) expressions were sharply increased by TPS treatment in colitis mice. Expectedly, TPS was found to exert its gut barrier functions through the activation of AhR to upregulate epithelial tight junction proteins. These findings highlight the protective effects of TPS against ulcerative colitis by modulating the gut microbiota and improving microbial metabolites and gut barrier function. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	9793	9807	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01468d					FSTA:2022-02-Te0502

Food & Function					Bifidobacterium longum (B. longum) species are widely used to prevent and treat ulcerative colitis (UC). In this study, phylogenetic and pan-genomic characterization of 122 B. longum strains was performed on the basis of 936 core genes; among these, four strains from different branches of the phylogenetic tree were selected for an evaluation of anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory activities in a DSS-induced colitis mouse model. Among the tested B. longum strains (B. longum FBJ20M1, B. longum FGDLZ8M1, B. longum FGSZY16M3, and B. longum FJSWXJ2M1), B. longum FGDLZ8M1 was found to most effectively alleviate colitis by reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, restoring the colon length, and maintaining the mucosal integrity. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of B. longum FGDLZ8M1 were related to the inhibition of NF-kappaB signaling. Genomic analysis indicated that these protective effects of B. longum FGDLZ8M1 may be related to specific genes associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism and defense mechanisms (e.g., tolerance to bile salts and acids). Correlation analysis indicated that gastrointestinal transit tolerance was the most strongly associated factor. Our findings may contribute to the rapid screening of lactic acid bacterial strains with UC-alleviating effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	8	3476	3492	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00017a					FSTA:2021-09-Ad13417
J		Chengcheng Zhang; Jianming Zhang; Daqun Liu							Biochemical changes and microbial community dynamics during spontaneous fermentation of Zhacai, a traditional pickled mustard tuber from China.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Zhacai is a traditional fermented vegetable that has been consumed in China for centuries. It is currently manufactured by spontaneous fermentation and therefore mostly relies on the activities of autochthonous microorganisms. Here, we characterized microbial community dynamics and associated biochemical changes in 12% salted Zhacai during a 90-day spontaneous fermentation process using high-throughput sequencing and chromatography-based approaches to identify associations between microorganisms and fermentation characteristics. Amplicon sequencing targeting bacterial 16S rRNA genes revealed that bacterial communities were dominated by halophilic bacteria (HAB, i.e., Halomonas and Idiomarina) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB, i.e., Lactobacillus-related genera and Weissella) after 30 days of fermentation. In addition, the relative abundances of the fungal genera Debaryomyces, Sterigmatomyces, and Sporidiobolus increased as fermentation progressed. Concomitantly, pH decreased while titratable acidity increased during fermentation, along with associated variation in biochemical profiles. Overall, the levels of organic acids (i.e., lactic and acetic acid), free amino acids (i.e., alanine, lysine, and glutamic acid), and volatiles (i.e., alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones) increased in mature Zhacai. In addition, the abundances of Lactobacillus-related species, Halomonas spp., Idiomarina loihiensis, as well as that of the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii, were strongly correlated with increased concentrations of organic acids, amino acids, biogenic amines, and volatiles. This study provides new detailed insights into the succession of microbial communities and their potential roles in Zhacai fermentation.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study analyzed the microbiomes and metabolomes of four Chinese and four European cheeses using deep metagenome sequencing and liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry. Our results revealed great variations in the cheese microbiome and metabolome between samples, but samples originated from the same region shared a higher similarity. Deep metagenome sequencing identified four novel species (belonging to the Salinicoccus, Kocuria, and Glutamicibacter genera), and their profiles of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolite clusters coding genes supported that these novel species were involved in cheese flavor formation. The main differential metabolites between Chinese and European cheeses were amino acids and volatile substances. Significant correlations were found between individual cheese-associated bacterial taxa (especially lactic acid bacteria) and metabolites (r > 0.6, p < 0.05), suggesting that these taxa and metabolites together shaped the cheese flavor. The cheese microbiome comprised a high proportion of phage (26.06%), providing evidence of phage infection/genome integration and horizontal gene transfer from phage to bacteria. Such processes would also modulate cheese microbiomes and thus flavor quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	151				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112043					FSTA:2021-12-Pj6893
J		Chengdeng Chi; Xiaoxi Li; Yiping Zhang; Ling Chen; Lin Li; Song Miao							Progress in tailoring starch intrinsic structures to improve its nutritional value.		Food Hydrocolloids					Starch intrinsic structures significantly influence its digestibility and nutritional attributes. Versatile technologies, including genetic, enzymatic, and physical processes, have been widely used to tailor starch intrinsic structures and, in turn, the digestibility. This review summarizes the current understanding of how conventional modifications affect key intrinsic structures in starch and their underlying mechanisms to regulate the digestibility. It is concluded that densely-packed structures (i.e., short-range ordered structure, helical structure, crystalline structure, and lamellar structures) and highly-branched amylopectin are the key factors affecting starch digestibility. Enzymatic branching treatment significantly increases the content of highly-branched amylopectin for slowing starch digestion. Interaction-reinforcing technologies promote starch reassembly to form helical and crystalline structures, and the ordered aggregated structures result in a reduction in starch digestibility. Interaction-reinforcing techniques include (i) genetically or enzymatically increasing amylose content and elongating amylopectin chain length, (ii) hydrothermal treatment (e.g., heat-moisture treatment, autoclaving, and annealing), and (iii) complexation with non-starchy ingredients (e.g., lipids, proteins, phenolic compounds, and hydrocolloids). With increasing demand for health-promoting foods by consumers and markets, enhanced understanding of starch intrinsic structures and their effects on digestibility after modification will facilitate the development of new products with desired nutritional attributes through starch structuration.

Food Chemistry					A multi-residue method has been developed for the identification and quantification of 78 compounds from seven different classes of veterinary drugs in eggs. This method was based on dispersive solid phase extraction where mixed-mode cation exchange sorbent was used to combine the isolation of compounds and sample purification. The analysis was performed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and the chromatographic run time of one injection was 9.5 min. The mean recovery ranged from 70.5% to 119.2% and inter-day relative standard deviation was less than 17.0%. The limit of quantification ranged between 0.1 and 1 mug/kg, which was sufficient to support surveillance monitoring. Lastly, the method was successfully used to detect residues of veterinary drug in real samples. The dietary exposure risk was subsequently assessed using the results of the survey, indicating that the evaluated daily intake and percentage of acceptable daily intake were at toxicologically acceptable levels.

Food Analytical Methods					Sterols play an essential part in physiological activities of almost all creatures. However, there is a lack of a widely applicable routine method to investigate various sterols with both saturated and unsaturated forms in diversiform food materials. In this study, a new UPLC-MS/MS method with wider extensive applicability has been developed to fill this blank, which is considered time and cost saving, and can improve labor efficiency. The Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column and methanol-water gradient elution system were employed to improve the separation at 40 °C and the flow rate was 0.5 mL/min. The method validation parameters include precision, recovery, linearity, and limit of detection and quantification (LOD and LOQ). The recoveries of sterols in all food matrices and the inter-day and intra-day precisions represented by RSDs were all within the recommended range of chemical analysis. The LODs and LOQs in different types of samples were in range of 0.0036-0.68 mug/mL and 0.01-2.0 mug/mL, respectively. All the results demonstrated that this method was sensitive and accurate enough. Additionally, the acid hydrolysis was found closely related to the degradation of unsaturated sterols in the pretreatment. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	6	1202	1215	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-020-01962-6					FSTA:2021-11-Aj15324

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Sugarcane smut, caused by Sporisorium scitamineum, is one of the most devastating fungal diseases affecting sugarcane worldwide. To develop a potent sugarcane smut fungicide, secondary metabolites of marine-derived Bacillus siamensis were isolated and screened for inhibitory activities, which led to the discovery of five new 24-membered macrolactins, bamemacrolactins A-E (1-5), with 3 being the most potent inhibitor. The antifungal mechanism of 3 was studied by assessing its effects on mycelial morphology and the cell wall. Differential proteomics were used to analyze proteins in S. scitamineum upon treatment with bamemacrolactin C and to elucidate its antifungal mechanism. A total of 533 differentially expressed proteins were found. After the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, eight target proteins were selected, and their functions were discussed. Six of the eight proteins were reported as antifungal targets. The target proteins are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. Therefore, the potent inhibition of S. scitamineum by compound 3 is most likely through oxidative phosphorylation and targeting a series of enzymes.										2021	69	15	4392	4401	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07415					FSTA:2021-08-Lc1316

Food Science & Nutrition					Immune-based interventions are the most promising approach for new cancer treatments to achieve long-term cancer-free survival. However, the expansion of myeloid-derived suppression cells (MDSCs) attenuates the therapeutic potential of immunotherapy. We recently showed that CD205+ granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs), but not T cells, are sensitive to glucose deficiency. Intermittent fasting (IF) may inhibit the growth of malignant cells by reducing serum glucose levels, but little is known regarding the influence of IF on MDSC expansion. Herein, we observed that IF selectively inhibited splenic accumulation of CD205+ G-MDSCs in a 4T1 and 4T07 transplant murine breast cancer model. The efficiency of IF in suppressing tumor growth was comparable to that of docetaxel. Further examination revealed that CXCR4 expression was concentrated in CD205+ subsets of tumor-induced G-MDSCs. Downregulation of CXCR4 correlated with a reduction in CD205+ G-MDSC trafficking from bone marrow to the spleen under IF treatment. In addition, ex vivo culture assays showed that glucose deficiency and 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) treatment selectively induced massive death of splenic CD205+ G-MDSCs. Interestingly, 2DG emulated the phenomena of IF selectively suppressing the accumulation of CD205+ G-MDSCs in the spleen, upregulating cleaved caspase 3 in the tumor, downregulating Ki67 in the lung, and retarding the growth of transplanted 4T1 and 4T07 murine breast tumors. These findings suggest that IF inhibited cell trafficking through the downregulation of CXCR4 and induced apoptosis by altering glucose metabolism; this, suppressed the accumulation of tumor-induced splenic CD205+ G-MDSCs and in turn enhanced antitumor immunity. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A tumor-related hypoxic microenvironment can promote the proliferation of gastric cancer cells, and hypoxic-induced autophagy is the main mechanism of protection against hypoxia in gastric cancer cells. Isorhamnetin (ISO) is a chemical substance derived from plants, mainly from the sea buckthorn. Previous studies have shown that ISO has antitumor effects, but the effects of ISO against gastric cancer in a hypoxic environment are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of ISO against gastric cancer in a hypoxic environment and the mechanisms underlying ISO-induced gastric cancer cell death. The results show that ISO targeted PI3K and blocked the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway, significantly inhibiting gastric cancer cell autophagy in a hypoxic environment, inhibiting cell proliferation, decreasing mitochondrial membrane potential, and promoting mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. ISO, a functional food component, is a promising candidate for the treatment of gastric cancer.										2021	69	29	8130	8143	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02620					FSTA:2021-11-Jg15843

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The effect of melatonin treatment on color, chlorophyll degradation and chloroplast structure in broccoli during storage was evaluated. One hundred mummol L-1 melatonin markedly extended the shelf life of broccoli. Compared with control florets, melatonin treatment delayed the decline of chlorophyll content, and maintained more intact chloroplasts. Meanwhile, melatonin also suppressed the activities of chlorophyll catabolic enzymes such as chlorophyllase (CLH), pheophytinase (PPH), pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO) and red chlorophyll catabolite reductase (RCCR), and down-regulated the expressions of BoNYC1, BoNOL, BoCLH, BoPPH, BoPAO, BoRCCR and BoSGR1 involved in chlorophyll catabolism.

Food Science & Nutrition					The presence of sulfate groups in agar compromises the agar quality by affecting the crosslinking during gelling process. Some arylsulfatases can catalyze the hydrolysis of sulfate bonds in agar to improve the agar quality. Immobilized arylsulfatases prove beneficial advantages for their industrial applications. Here, a previously characterized mutant arylsulfatase K253H/H260L was immobilized on the synthesized magnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles after functionalization by tannic acid (MNPs@TA). The surface properties and molecular structures of the immobilized arylsulfatase (MNPs@TA@ARS) were examined by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Enzymatic characterization showed that MNPs@TA@ARS exhibited shifted optimal temperature and pH with deviated apparent Km and Vmax compared to its free counterpart. The immobilized arylsulfatase demonstrated improved thermal and pH stability and enhanced storage stability with modest reusability. In addition, MNPs@TA@ARS displayed enhanced tolerance to various inhibitors and detergents. The utilization of the immobilized arylsulfatase for agar desulfation brought the treated agar with improved quality. © 2021 The Authors.

The pesticide residue removal effect of aqueous ozone treatment for 5 min was also determined. The results show that the growth rates of aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and yeasts were significantly inhibited (p<.05) by aqueous ozone treatment during storage; treatment for 10 min showed the greatest inactivation of bacteria, coliforms, and molds. Aqueous ozone stimulated initial respiratory metabolism compared with that of the control. Aqueous ozone treatments reduced ethylene production and improved the overall quality of fresh-cut cabbage. In addition, the effect of aqueous ozone treatment for 5 min on the removal of trichlorfon, chlorpyrifos, methomyl, dichlorvos, and omethoate from fresh-cut cabbage was greater (p<.05) than that of the control.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The effects of aqueous ozone (AO) treatment on the firmness, cellwall polysaccharide content, enzymatic activity, and gene expression of cell wall-degrading enzymes were investigated in fresh-cut apple during cold storage. AO treatment (1.4 mg L-1 for 5 min) delayed degradation of cellwall polysaccharides to reduce softening of fresh-cut apple. Water-soluble pectin content increased more slowly, while protopectin content, 4% KOH-soluble fraction, and cellulose content decreased at a lower rate in AO-treated fresh-cut apple compared with the control. However, no significant influence was shown on the 24% KOH-soluble fraction. AO treatment promoted increased pectin methylesterase activity, and distinctly inhibited beta-galactosidase and alpha-arabinofuranosidase activities during storage. Polygalacturonase activity was not affected by AO treatment. Meanwhile, AO maintained the intactness of cell walls through repression of Mdbeta-Gal and Mdalpha-Af transcript levels, thereby preserving the textural quality of fresh-cut apple during cold storage.

Foods					Globally, village chicken is popular and is known as a premium meat with a higher price. Food fraud can occur by selling other chicken breeds at a premium price in local markets. This study aimed to distinguish local village chicken from other chicken breeds available in the market, namely, colored broiler (Hubbard), broiler (Cobb), and spent laying hen (Dekalb) in pectoralis major and serum under commercial conditions using an untargeted metabolomics approach. Both pectoralis major and serum were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The principal component analysis (PCA) results distinguished four different chicken breeds into three main groups for pectoralis major and serum. A total of 30 and 40 characteristic metabolites were identified for pectoralis major and serum, respectively. The four chicken breeds were characterized by the abundance of metabolites such as amino acids (L-glutamic acid, L-threonine, L-serine, L-leucine), organic acids (L-lactic acid, succinic acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid), sugars (D-allose, D-glucose), sugar alcohols (myo-inositol), and fatty acids (linoleic acid). Our results suggest that an untargeted metabolomics approach using GC-MS and PCA could discriminate chicken breeds for pectoralis major and serum under commercial conditions. In this study, village chicken could only be distinguished from colored broiler (Hubbard) by serum samples. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chengliang Li; Mora, L.; Toldra, F.							Characterization of antioxidant efficacy of peptide extracts as affected by peptide interactions during the ripening of Spanish dry-cured ham.		Food Research International					Microenvironmental factors may influence the antioxidant efficacy of food-derived peptides. This study evaluated the in vitro antioxidant properties of peptides released during the ripening (9 to 24 months of processing) of Spanish dry-cured ham (Biceps femoris muscle) assisted by spectral-chromatographic methodologies. Results indicated that 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) radical-cation (ABTS.+) quenching capacity of peptide extracts significantly increased (P< 0.05) until 24 months whereas peroxyl radical (ROO.) scavenging activity increased slowly and remained with non-significant change (P> 0.05) between 15 and 24 months. However, both ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH.) scavenging ability significantly decreased (P< 0.05) at 24 months. Additionally, morphological traits of peptide extracts suggested that a prolonged ripening enabled the formation/reconstruction of intra-/inter-molecular interactions in dispersion medium. Meta-analysis of chromatographic and spectral fingerprinting proved that the non-conjugated/pi-conjugated oligomers mediated by aromatic moieties probably differentiated DPPH. and ABTS.+ antioxidant performance of peptides, showing a potentially altered solvent polarization process.

J		Chenglin Zhu; Kaiwei Tang; Xuan Lu; Junni Tang; Laghi, L.							An untargeted metabolomics investigation of milk from dairy cows with clinical mastitis by 1H-NMR.		Foods					Mastitis is one of the diseases with the highest incidence in dairy cows, causing huge economic losses to the dairy industry all over the world. The aim of the study was to characterize mastitic milk metabolome through untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR). Taking advantage of the high reproducibility of 1H-NMR, we had the opportunity to provide quantitative information for all the metabolites identified. Fifty-four molecules were characterized, sorted mainly into the chemical groups, namely amino acids, peptides and analogues, carbohydrates and derivates, organic acids and derivates, nucleosides, nucleotides and analogues. Combined with serum metabolomic investigations, several pathways were addressed to explain the mechanisms of milk metabolome variation affected by clinical mastitis, such as tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis. These results provide a further understanding of milk metabolome altered by clinical mastitis, which can be used as a reference for the further milk metabolome investigations. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chenglong Liu; Bin Yu; Haiteng Tao; Pengfei Liu; Haibo Zhao; Congping Tan; Bo Cui							Effects of soy protein isolate on mechanical and hydrophobic properties of oxidized corn starch film.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Oxidized corn starch (OS) has a good film-forming ability; however, its poor mechanical properties and moisture barrier are shortcomings. To improve the deficiencies of OS film, soy protein isolate (SPI) with different ratios (10%, 20%, and 30%) was incorporated into OS film at different pH values (6, 8, and 10) to investigate the mechanical and hydrophobic properties of the blended films. The blended films were characterized by water sensitivity, contact angle, mechanical properties, optical properties, and microstructure. The increases in the SPI ratio and pH reduced the moisture content and total soluble matter of the blended films. The reduction in water vapor permeability and the increase in contact angle from 37.3° to 104.5° suggested that the moisture barrier of the OS film was improved by SPI. The elongation at break of blended films increased, but the tensile strength decreased with increasing of SPI content and pH. The blended films prepared at pH 10 were more yellow and had higher transmittance. Scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy showed that the blended films exhibited denser microstructures and smoother surfaces with the increasing pH. X-ray diffraction and thermogravimetric analysis implied that SPI interfered with the intermolecular interaction of OS.

Food & Function					Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is one of the major causes of low back pain, but effective therapies are still lacking because of its complicated pathology. It has been demonstrated that increased levels of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) may promote the development of IVDD. Cardamonin (CAR) is a chalcone extracted from Alpinia katsumadai and other plants. It exhibits an anti-inflammatory effect in multiple diseases. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of CAR on rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells under IL-1beta stimulation in vitro and in a puncture-induced rat IVDD model in vivo. We explored the CAR treatment's inhibition of the expression of inflammatory factors such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in rat NP cells. Moreover, the up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5) and the degradation of aggrecan and collagen II induced by IL-1beta were reversed by CAR. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that CAR inhibited nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) in IL-1beta-induced rat NP cells. Furthermore, the protective effect of CAR was shown in the IVDD model through persistent intragastric administration. Taken together, our results revealed that CAR could activate the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling axis and be a novel agent for IVDD therapy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	6	2703	2714	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03353g					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10724

Food Hydrocolloids					This study investigated the impact of creeping fig seed polysaccharide (CFSP) on the pasting, rheological, textural properties and the in vitro digestibility of potato starch (PS). Results showed that CFSP greatly decreased the peak, trough, and breakdown viscosity during PS pasting. CFSP also increased the thixotropy properties of PS. The introduction of CFSP disrupted the PS network and decreased the consistency coefficient of PS. No disrupting effect was observed in textural properties. The hardness of CFSP-PS gel was increased with increasing CFSP ratios, while the springiness remained unchanged. This could be explained by increased pore wall thickness and size of the CFSP-PS gel structure. Moreover, substitution with CFSP not only decreased the rate but also the extent of starch digestion in vitro, and the decreases were increased with CFSP ratios. These effects may be attributed to the ability of CFSP to immobilize water and interfere with the network structure of PS. To sum, CFSP is a promising hydrocolloid that can improve both the processing and nutritional properties of PS.

J		Chengqian Jin; Yan Kang; Hongxing Guo; Xiang Yin							An experimental and finite element analysis of the characteristics of soybean grain compression damage.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					During mechanized harvesting, the compression of soybean grains is the main form of crushing caused by the interaction between the operating components and the soybean grains; the resulting damage characteristics of the grains are not well understood. Using Zhengdou 1307 as test materials, the characteristics of stress distributions under different moisture contents soybean grains in the horizontal, lateral, and vertical positions were measured and analyzed, the process of compressive damage was observed, and the damage characteristics due to compression forces were obtained. The test results show that the forced form and compressive displacement of a soybean grain is related to the magnitude of the compressive force, and the location of the stress concentration moves toward the contact, as the contact area decreases, breaking force decreases with increasing moisture content. The grain is subjected to the highest pressure when placed flat, and cracks along the vertical line of the hilum upon rupture. When placed laterally and vertically, the damage to the grain due to a compressive force is mainly from the separation of the two cotyledons. Practical applications. The crushing rate is an important indicator to measure the harvest quality of the soybean combine. The mechanical properties of soybean grains are an important factor affecting the crushing rate. In the process of mechanized soybean harvesting, the compression of soybean grains is the main form of crushing caused by the interaction between working parts and soybean grains, but the characteristics of soybean grains damaged by compression are not clear. This study provides a reference for the analysis of soybean damage during the harvesting, transporting, storing, and other stages by studying the damage characteristics of soybean grains, and provides certain ideas for the study of other grain damage characteristics. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	7			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13721					FSTA:2021-10-Jn14341

Food Science & Nutrition					To derive a mutant of L. helveticus SH2-1 with the capacity of weak postacidification and high texturing, first, taking L. delbrueckii frs4-1 and S. thermophilus grx02 as the controls, H+-ATPase activity was demonstrated to be highly related to the postacidification of L. helveticus SH2-1. Then, by detecting H+-ATPase activity, the weak postacidify mutant of L. helveticus SH2-1 (renamed as L. helveticus sh2-5-66) was selected from 80 UV mutants. The pH and acidity of the milk fermented with L. helveticus sh2-5-66 were separately 0.57 pH units higher and 57.1 °T lower than that of L. helveticus SH2-1. The acidification of L. helveticus sh2-5-66 was further demonstrated to be genetically stable during 100 generations cultivation. Moreover, the milk fermented with L. helveticus sh2-5-66 showed improvement in textural and rheological properties and flavor during storage which could be further improved by coculture with the commercial starter S. thermophilus st447. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Chengrong Wen; Nan Wang; Yingying Dong; Jie Tian; Shuang Song; Hang Qi							Calcium-induced-gel properties for L-carrageenan in the presence of different charged amino acids.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					L-Carrageenan (IC) is a water-soluble polysaccharide containing high sulfate groups, whose gel properties are influenced by charged materials. The rheological and thermal properties, water mobility, morphology, and structure of the binary blends of calcium-L-carrageenan (CCa) with different charged amino acids including arginine (Arg, positive), glutamine (Gln, neutrality), and glutamic acid (Glu, negative) were evaluated. Different charged amino acids affected the gel properties of CCa with different mechanisms. There were the highest elastic (G′) and viscous (G) moduli of CCa gels at 0.5 mg/mL Arg and 1 mg/mL Gln, while both G′ and G were decreased by adding Glu. The water mobility of CCa gel was weakened by Arg and Glu, while no significant influence was observed for Gln. The thermal properties of CCa were improved by amino acids. Gln fills the gaps in the network structure through hydrogen bond and weak electrostatic interaction to stabilize the gel structure, while Arg and Glu affect the formation of gel through hydrogen bonds and strong electrostatic interaction. The information obtained from this research will provide insights into the further application of carrageenan and amino acid combinations in the food, biomedical, and cosmetic fields.

J		Chengshuang Wang; Jie Zhang; Jieru Huang; Han Wang; Meng He; Liang Ding							Flame retardant modified bio-based waterborne polyurethane dispersions derived from castor oil and soy polyol.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					Although tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing environmentally friendly bio-based waterborne polyurethane (WPU) dispersions from vegetable oil, the fabrication of WPU dispersions solely derived from vegetable oil-based polyol with excellent comprehensive properties is still challenging. In the present work, novel bio-based WPU dispersions derived from castor oil and soy polyol is successfully modified by phosphorus-nitrogen chain extender [bis (2-hydroxyethyl) amino]-methyl-phosphonic acid dimethyl ester (BH). The structure and properties of the dispersions and films are characterized systematically by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, mechanical test, and limiting oxygen index (LOI), etc. The results indicate that bio-based WPU films display moderate mechanical performance by adjusting BH content, and the WPU film containing 100% BH with 47.8% biobased content has a tensile strength of 8 MPa and the highest Young's modulus of 62.3 MPa. The incorporation of BH can increase the production of char residue. The flame retardancy of WPU films increase gradually with the BH molar content, and the LOI value of the WPU100 with 1.53 wt% phosphorus content can reach as high as 28.1%. This work may provide a new approach to develop high biobased content, eco-friendly, flame retardant WPU for application in the surface coating industry. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	4			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000248					FSTA:2021-08-Ne1765

Food Control					Public health intervention priorities to control the spread of antimicrobial resistance in the food sector rely on a comprehensive understanding of its situation among various food products. By analyzing a set of fifteen different kinds of food products (n=495) collected at retail in Beijing, China, we found the food-animal products, vegetables, aquatic products and fruits were highly contaminated by E. coli (38.4%, 95% CI: 34.1%-42.8%) and enterococci (74.5%, 95% CI: 70.5%-78.3%), showing a multidrug-resistance (MDR) proportion of 20.3% and 39.5%, respectively. With the highest incidence of E. coli (66.7%, 95% CI: 57.9%-74.6%) and enterococci (80.3%, 95% CI: 72.5%-86.7%), as well as the high MDR proportion; the food-animal products were indeed the most important reservoir of antimicrobial resistance; although the role of vegetables, fruits and aquatic products in the spreading AMR shouldn't be downplayed. These food-borne isolates were highly resistant to antibiotic that are widely used in agriculture, such as tetracycline (E. coli, 65.8%; enterococci, 36.9%) and ampicillin (E. coli, 60.5%), and also to antibiotics that are barely used in the agriculture/aquaculture, such as rifampin (enterococci, 55.3%) and ciprofloxacin (enterococci, 36.9%). Moreover, we observed positive correlations between food types and some particular resistance phenotypes of the isolates. In addition, genes coding resistance to clinical important antibiotics, mcr-1 (colistin) and optrA (oxazolidinones), were detected in the food-borne isolates and showed by bioinformatics analysis a potential in connecting animals and humans.

Journal of Cereal Science					The cooking method is the key factor influencing the cooking quality of rice. In this study, the effect of different cooking pressures on phenolic compounds, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), antioxidant activity and volatile compounds with an adjustable pressure cooker was investigated. The high-pressure cooking (60, 70 and 105 kPa) resulted in a greater retention of total phenolic content and total antioxidant activity as compared with low-pressure cooking (30, 40 and 50 kPa). Further, UPLC-PDA-MS/MS analysis indicated that high-pressure cooking was more effective in term of free phenolic compounds retention (p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid) and caused the significant increase in two predominant bound phenolic compounds (ferulic acid and isoferulic acid). Besides, with the increase of cooking pressures, the GABA content decreased. GC-MS result suggested that high-pressure cooking (50, 60, 70 and 105 kPa) significantly decreased off-flavor compounds contents (hexanal, 2-pentylfuran and 2,3-dihydrobenzofuran) compared to low-pressure cooking (30 and 40 kPa). This study extended the present knowledge about the effect of cooking pressure on bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity and volatile flavor of brown rice. The obtained results may provide the valuable information on improvement of cooking quality for brown rice.

Food Control					Yellow croakers (Larimichthys spp.), including Larimichthys polyactis and L. crocea, are important traditional commercial fish species in East Asian countries. However, they are often replaced by low-value fish with similar morphological characteristics. This work aimed to exploit the application of DNA barcoding in molecular identification of L. polyactis, L. crocea and morphologically similar species of Nibea albiflora, Collichthys lucidus, Pennahia argentata, and P. macrocephalus. Mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase I (COI) was affirmed as DNA barcode for the authentication of yellow croakers and yellow croaker products in China. Results showed that 37.03% (10/27) of the yellow croaker products were mislabeled and replaced by P. macrocephalus and P. argentata, suggesting that mislabeling is a widespread problem. In general, COI barcode, as a molecular tool, provides a useful method for the identification of yellow croakers, which may prevent mislabeling of fish products and food fraud.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Pufferfish is a traditional, delicious dish in Asia. However, eating wild or improperly processed pufferfish causes serious poisoning. This study aimed to exploit the high-resolution melting (HRM) method for authenticating four species of Takifugu pufferfish (Takifugu xanthopterus, T. fasciatus, T. flavidus, and T. rubripes). Candidate DNA barcodes, including the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI), cytochrome oxidase b (Cytb), and the control region (D-loop), were analyzed, with COI selected as the optimal DNA barcode. An HRM method was developed to identify 57 commercial fish samples in China, including 33 commercial pufferfish products and 24 unlabeled fish products. The findings revealed that the pufferfish products were T. rubripes or T. fasciatus, and four T. xanthopterus samples were detected in unlabeled fish products. These results showed that DNA barcode coupled with HRM analysis was a rapid and efficient tool to identify pufferfish, which might aid in the prevention of consumer fraud or mislabeling of fish products.

The statistical assessment and pathway analysis of the metabolomics data demonstrated that in spite of significant metabolic changes in response to the germination treatment, the Japonica rice cultivars consistently expressed higher levels of several health-promoting compounds, such as essential amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), than the Indica cultivars. No clear discriminations of the volatile profiles were observed in light of the subspecies, and the concentrations of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including alkenes, aldehydes, furans, ketones, and alcohols, all exhibited significant reductions ranging from 26.8% to 64.1% after the germination.

Journal of Cereal Science					The low phytic acid (lpa) rice mutant Os-lpa-XS110-2, exhibiting OsMRP5 mutation-induced metabolic features (i.e. decreased levels of phytic acid and raffinose, and increased levels of amino acids and biogenic amine GABA), was crossed with two commercial rice cultivars. The inferior field emergence rate of the lpa mutant was significantly improved upon cross-breeding. The GC/MS-based metabolomics was utilized to investigate the impact of cross-breeding on the metabolite profiles of the resulting progeny rice grains. Multivariate and univariate analyses showed that in spite of the predominant influence of crossing parent on the metabolite profiles of the progenies, the OsMRP5 mutation-induced metabolite signature, was stably expressed in the lpa mutant progenies over generations. The OsMRP5 lpa rice mutant seeds might be considered valuable genetic resources to develop rice grains with favorable metabolic traits.

Food Hydrocolloids					The preparation route of the water-soluble rice glutelin-glutelin (extracted from two subspecies of Japonica and Indica rice, respectively) system is proposed and tested in laboratory-scale, which can potentially be scaled up for industrial production. The two-components in highly alkaline condition was carefully acidified to neutral to produce whole rice glutelin. The interfacial properties of the system can be adjusted by changing the ratio of rice glutelin origins (Japonica group (JRG) or Indica group (IRG)), so that the surface hydrophobicity can be reduced to expose the charged groups. The created protein structure is robust and could maintain desirable wettability after single droplet drying and freeze-drying. To date, the application of plant proteins has been largely limited by the poor solubility of hydrophobic aggregates. The proposed JRG-IRG system is a crucial step toward aqueous rice protein materials. The potential to prepare aqueous composites was also demonstrated by synergistic modification of plant proteins from different subspecies.

J		Chengxin He; Yu Hu; Meng Wai Woo; Hua Xiong; Qiang Zhao							Effect of microbial transglutaminase on the structural and rheological characteristics and in vitro digestion of rice glutelin-casein blends.		Food Research International					The effect of microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) in cross-linking and modifying of rice glutelin-casein blends was investigated in this work. The maximum MTGase activity on rice glutelin-casein blends were found when its addition was 15 U/g of protein. Compared with the blends without MTGase, the appropriate addition of MTGase significantly affected the microstructure of the cross-linked proteins, resulting in the gradual "burying" of Trp residue; while the space for hydrogen bonding was more abundant. Secondary structure changes, denoted by the disappearance of the alpha-helix and the decrement of the beta-sheet structure, was due to the formation of the large loop and random coil structures. The MTGase-catalyzed reaction improves the protease resistance of the blends but not promote the conversion of free sulfhydryl groups (-SH) to disulfide groups (S-S). All the samples evaluated exhibited Bingham flow behavior instead of shear-thinning behavior, and thermally stable fluid properties dominated by elasticity, regardless of MTGase concentration used. Both the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G'') gradually decreased with the addition of MTGase. In short, this work demonstrated how the structure, rheology, digestibility of rice glutelin-casein blends are influenced by MTGase concentration.

Food Quality and Preference					The comparability or similarity of consumers' behavior in virtual reality (VR) and in real life (RL) is indispensable to successfully take advantage of VR technology in consumer behavior (CB) research. This study investigated the comparability of participants' behavior in a virtual environment and in RL to validate VR for data acquisition in CB research. Participants (N = 98) were randomly assigned to a RL condition or a VR condition in which the settings were chosen to mimic a RL environment as closely as possible. In both conditions, participants ranked 20 types of commercial breakfast cereal by their perceived healthiness from healthy to unhealthy. We observed that the perceived healthiness of the 20 cereals in the VR and RL conditions were highly correlated (rs = 0.91, p<.001, N = 20). The information-seeking behavior was not different between the two conditions, t (96) = -1.11, p = .27. Furthermore, the attributes employed by the participants to evaluate the healthiness of the cereals did not vary between the two conditions. The presence level of the participants in the virtual environment was also examined. The results illustrate that the participants' behavior in the virtual environment and in the real world were comparable, which provides robust evidence for the validity of VR as a beneficial and promising tool for data acquisition in CB research.

Equal molar of EGCG and vinyl laurate (1:1); lipase addition of 6.0% (w/w of total substrates); reaction temperature of 50°C and reaction time of 96 h, which obtained the conversion rate of EGCG at 80.1%. The structure of EGCG lauroyl derivatives were 5-O-lauroyl-EGCG, 3, 5-2-O-lauroyl-EGCG, and 5′, 3, 5-3-O-lauroyl-EGCG, identified by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Compared with the logP of precursor EGCG (0.69 0.03), the logP of EGCG lauroyl derivatives was 1.370.19,2.270.33, and 3.28 0.37, increasing by 0.98, 2.28, and 3.75 times, respectively (p< 0.05), suggesting the grafted fatty acid chains make EGCG derivatives more lipophilic, and the lipid solubility gradually increased as the number of substituents increased. Furthermore, EGCG lauroyl derivatives had excellent lipid oxidation than that of EGCG. The POVs (peroxide values) of soybean oil with mono-, di-, tri-lauroyl EGCG were significantly reduced by 42%, 47%, and 57% than that of EGCG at 21 days, respectively, indicating the antioxidative inhibition of these derivatives decreased with the increase in substituents. This indicates that these derivatives have broad prospects of the antioxidant application while improving their solubility properties in lipophilic environments/high-fat food. Practical Application. The lipophilic esterification reaction of EGCG catalyzed by new catalytic lipase DF "Amano" 15 was carried out in a non-aqueous solvent. Various reaction factors on a higher conversion rate of EGCG lauroyl derivatives were evaluated. The lipophilicity and antioxidant properties of EGCG lauroyl derivatives were much excellent than that of parent EGCG. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	10	4717	4729	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15894					FSTA:2022-02-Ne0239
J		Chengyu Wang; Hongyan Bi							Super-fast seafood authenticity analysis by One-step pretreatment and comparison of mass spectral patterns.		Food Control					Pretreatment is a critical step in the analysis of samples with complex matrices such as most food samples. Time-saving pre-processing methods are always desirable. Aimed at obtaining a rapid method for seafood authenticity analysis, several one-step methods were compared to pretreat fish muscle tissues for obtaining an optimal pretreatment. The acid processing method relies on boiling tissue sample in 0.1 M trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) for 5 min, exhibiting advantages of being reproducible, efficient, and capable of realizing a good spectral resolution when analyzing the resultant samples by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry (MS). When combined this acid method with similarity coefficient-based analysis for their mass spectra, different fish samples can be distinguished. Two single-blind seafood samples from market were authenticated. The acid method combined with comparison of mass spectral pattern greatly simplifies the seafood identification analysis and can promisingly be applied in super-fast food authenticity testing.

J		Chengzhi Liu; Nan Lv; Gerui Ren; Ruibo Wu; Binju Wang; Zexing Cao; Hujun Xie							Explore the interaction mechanism between zein and EGCG using multi-spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulation methods.		Food Hydrocolloids					Zein as a kind of carrier material has attracted extensive interest, while the interaction mechanism between zein and nutrients is still elusive. In this work, the binding mechanism of zein with epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) was investigated via multi-spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The quenching of zein by EGCG is mainly static quenching, and the secondary structure of zein is slightly changed after the binding of EGCG to zein. The formation of Zein-EGCG complexes was confirmed by ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation clarified that the EGCG prefers to bind to the pocket of zein formed by residues Y171, Q174, L176 and L205. Electrostatic and van der Waals interactions played a dominant role for the binding of EGCG to zein, which was consistent with the results by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermodynamic analysis. This study provides new insights into the interaction mechanism between zein and EGCG, which is very important to develop plant protein as tea polyphenol delivery system.

International Journal of Food Properties					Construction of food electronic nose (FEN) for prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) quality rapid assessment assisted with physicochemical parameters was explored in this paper. Sensory analysis, weight, GC/MS, and K value, and microbial were examined to provide the assisting basis for FEN system design. Results indicated that sensory acceptance decreased with the increase in time. The decline of prawn physiochemical parameters was associated with microbiological propagation. The volatile gases emitted by prawn could be utilized for sample quality characterization. FEN successfully discriminated all samples, and presented good detecting accuracy.

Food Chemistry					An electrochemical aptamer sensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was developed for highly specific sensing of melamine (MEL), which combines molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) and aptamers. AuNPs were synthesized by simple reduction of sodium citrate and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. The MIP membranes with particular recognition sites were formed by electropolymerization of dopamine (DA) with polythymine (poly T) aptamers as functional monomers and melamine as template molecules. Under optimal experimental conditions, this molecularly imprinted electrochemical aptamer sensor (MIEAS) exhibits a linear relationship between 10-12 M and 10-4 M for detecting MEL with the detection limit of 6.7*10-13 M. Moreover, this sensor displays excellent selectivity, reproducibility and stability. The milk samples analysis has confirmed the potential application of this MIEAS to quantitative detection of melamine.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Camellia oil (CO) microcapsules were developed using chitosan-soybean protein isolate (CS-SPI) complexes as wall materials and transglutaminase (TGase) as the cross-linking agent. Results. Indicated that CO/SPI under the ratio of 1:2 exhibited the highest microencapsulation efficiency and yield, possessing the best encapsulation effect. Morphology observation showed that CO microcapsules were intact, compact and nearly spherical. The microencapsulated CO exhibited the improved thermal resistance and significantly lower peroxide values after 3 days storage, demonstrating that the produced microcapsule was a promising way to maintain the thermal and oxidative stability of camellia oil. It could be found evidence from FTIR, which indicated that covalent cross-linking and hydrogen bonding might be involved among wall materials, and physical interactions between the core and wall materials. Therefore, the produced CO microcapsules could be an effective way to protect camellia oil, which was helpful for improving the processing and storage qualities of camellia oil. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	9	4780	4788	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15116					FSTA:2022-01-Ae0945

Food Chemistry					To investigate the effects of various duck sources on the lipid oxidation and aroma flavor of sauced-ducks, Mallard (ML), Sheldrake (SD), Muscovy (MC), and Cherry-Valley (CV) ducks were used in sauced-duck processing. The results showed significantly different thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of the four samples (SD > CV > ML > MC, p< 0.05), while the contents of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) were ML > SD/CV > MC (p< 0.05). Altogether, 105 volatile flavor compounds were detected in sauced-ducks, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, hydrocarbons, furans, nitrogen compounds, and others. The volatile compounds were observed differentially composed in the four products, and nineteen potential characteristic biomarkers were explored. The correlation analysis indicated that the characteristic aroma flavor of sauced-ducks were significantly associated with specific free fatty acids. These information are useful for learning aroma formation and meat selection and identification in duck products.

J		Chenlin Hu; Yanxia Zuo; Liang Peng; Nanqin Gan; Lirong Song							Widespread distribution and adaptive degradation of microcystin degrader (mlr-genotype) in Lake Taihu, China.		Toxins					Microbial degradation is an important route for removing environmental microcystins (MCs). Here, we investigated the ecological distribution of microcystin degraders (mlr-genotype), and the relationship between the substrate specificity of the microcystin degrader and the profile of microcystin congener production in the habitat. We showed that microcystin degraders were widely distributed and closely associated with Microcystis abundance in Lake Taihu, China. We characterized an indigenous degrader, Sphingopyxis N5 in the northern Lake Taihu, and it metabolized six microcystin congeners in increasing order (RR > LR > YR > LA > LF and LW). Such a substrate-specificity pattern was congruent to the order of the dominance levels of these congeners in northern Lake Taihu. Furthermore, a meta-analysis on global microcystin degraders revealed that the substrate-specificity patterns varied geographically, but generally matched the profiles of microcystin congener production in the degrader habitats, and the indigenous degrader typically metabolized well the dominant MC congeners, but not the rare congeners in the habitat. This highlighted the phenotypic congruence between microcystin production and degradation in natural environments. We theorize that such congruence resulted from the metabolic adaptation of the indigenous degrader to the local microcystin congeners. Under the nutrient microcystin selection, the degraders might have evolved to better exploit the locally dominant congeners. This study provided the novel insight into the ecological distribution and adaptive degradation of microcystin degraders. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					Amorphous granular starches from six different botanical sources were obtained by heating starch suspensions in water at or near pasting temperature. Their morphology was divided into two types: one was ghost-like with openings on the surface (sweet potato, tapioca, wheat and maize starches), and the other was gel-like with the surface porous structures (mung bean and pea starches). Their mean particle sizes (D50), specific surface areas, amylose contents, and molecular gyration z-average radii (Rz) were 30.6-57.0 mum, 0.359-0.649 m2/g, 13.7%-16.8%, and 88.9-115.3 nm, respectively. The amorphous granular starches showed better cold-water solubility (78.5%-94.2%), oil-adsorption capacity (43.1%-62.1%) and enzymolysis rate (58.5%-82.6%) characteristics at room temperature than those of the granular cold-water soluble (GCWS) starches and the pre-gelatinized (PG) starches. They could be used as thickening agents, adhesives, carriers of liposoluble function factors and basic materials of throat lozenges.

Y.; Peiyu Wang; Yumei Zhang							Fruit and vegetable consumption and serum vitamin A in lactating women: a cross-sectional survey in urban China.		Food Science & Nutrition					During the lactation period, healthy eating behavior is essential to maternal and child health. However, Chinese lactating women may have some traditional food restrictions. Our aims were to evaluate the fruit and vegetable consumption of Chinese lactating women and to examine the associations between fruit and vegetable consumption and serum vitamin A concentrations. A total of 885 participants were included. Dietary intakes were assessed during the same time frame as blood collection via a one-time 24-h dietary recall (24HDR) and a semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (SFFQ), respectively. Serum vitamin A concentrations were assessed with high-performance liquid chromatography. Based on 24HDR, 64.7% and 85.5% of lactating women did not consume the appropriate amount of fruits and vegetables, respectively. New mothers who adopt zuo yuezi behavior during the first month were negatively associated with fruit consumption. The median (25th to 75th) dietary vitamin A intake was 349.5 (202.5-591.4) mug RAE/day. Vegetable contributed 24.9% and fruit 4.8% of the dietary vitamin A intake. The median (25th to 75th) serum vitamin A concentration was 1.92 (1.61-2.30) mumol/L. 24HDR assessments of total fruit and vegetable consumption, and fruit consumption were positively associated with higher serum vitamin A concentrations, respectively (beta = 0.200, 95%CI = 0.077, 0.323, p = .001; beta = 0.241, 95%CI = 0.008, 0.474, p = .044). These positive associations were replicated in the SFFQ assessments (beta = 0.102, 95%CI = 0.016, 0.188, p = .020; beta = 0.215, 95%CI = 0.088, 0.341, p = .001). Chinese lactating women had inappropriate fruit and vegetable consumption. Fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with serum vitamin A concentrations. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Barley has abundant anthocyanin-rich accessions, which renders it an ideal model to investigate the regulatory mechanism of anthocyanin biosynthesis. This study functionally characterized two transcription factors: Ant1 and Ant2. Sequence alignment showed that the coding sequences of Ant1 and Ant2 are conserved among 11 colored hulless barley and noncolored barley varieties. The expression profiles of Ant1 and Ant2 were divergent between species, and significantly higher expression was found in two colored Qingke accessions. The co-expression of Ant1 and Ant2 resulted in purple pigmentation in transient transformation systems via the promotion of the transcription of four structural genes. Ant1interacted with Ant2, and overexpression of Ant1 activated the transcription of Ant2. Moreover, overexpression of Ant1 led to anthocyanin accumulation in the pericarp and aleurone layer of transgenic barley grains. Overall, our results suggest that anthocyanin-enriched barley grains can be produced by manipulating Ant1 expression.										2021	69	18	5306	5317	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c08147					FSTA:2021-10-Mg6147

SN-1009.		Food Chemistry					Endo-fucoidanases are important in structural analysis of fucoidans and preparation of fuco-oligosaccharides. However their enzymological properties and analysis of degradation products are scarcely investigated. Truncated endo-alpha (1 3)-fucoidanase Fda1 (tFda1B) from Alteromonas sp. was overexpressed and characterized, showing highest activity at pH 7.0,35 °C, and 1.0 M NaCl. Its Km and kcat were 3.88 0.81 mg/mL and 0.82 0.17 min-1. Fe3+ and Mn2+ enhanced activity by 100% and 19.5% respectively. Co2+ and Cu2+ completely inactivated tFda1B, whereas Ni2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ca2+, Ba2+ and Li+ decreased activity by 58.8%, 56.0%, 50.6%, 47.7%, 28.9%, 15.6% and 37.5%, respectively. Catalytic residues were identified through structure and sequence alignment, and confirmed by mutagenesis. Degradation products of Kjellmaniella crassifolia fucoidan by tFda1B were characterized by LC-ESI-MS/MS, confirming tFda1B belongs to endo-(1 3)-fucoidanases, and backbone of K. crassifolia fucoidan is 1 3 fucoside linkage. This endo-alpha (1 3)-fucoidanase would be useful for elucidating fucoidan structures, and be used as a food enzyme.

Characterization of kabylian virgin olive oils according to fatty alcohols, waxes, and fatty acid alkyl esters.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This work is aiming to characterize the fatty minor compounds of Kabylian virgin olive oils (Kabylian-VOOs) obtained from Chemlal, Azeradj and Bouichert olive cultivars. The content of sterols, triterpenic dialcohols, diterpenic alcohols, aliphatic alcohols, triterpenic alcohols, fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) and waxes were determined. The most abundant common sterols were beta-sitosterol and Delta5-avenasterol that were in high level in Azeradj-VOO and Chemlal-VOO, respectively. The wax and FAAEs content were close to limits set by the last trade standard regulation for all samples. Low amounts of aliphatic alcohols were found with a predominance of hexacosanol while high concentrations of triterpenic alcohols were found, in particular in Azeradj-VOO. The most abundant detected phytosterols were cycloartenol (823.60-2158.46mg/kg), beta-sitosterol (706.78-976.66mg/kg), butyrospermol (580.00-787.32mg/kg) and Delta5-avenasterolv (237.30-449.33mg/kg) for all samples. Multivariate statistical analyses showed a good discrimination according to the fatty alcohols although the composition of Chemlal-VOO was closer to that of Bouichert-VOO. The Azeradj-VOO alcoholic composition was different from others and it's the richest one in phytosterols. In summary, each Kabylian-VOO had its own alcoholic fingerprint in which cycloartenol (a 4,4′-dimethylsterol) was the main species, 2158.46 32.24mg/kg in the case of Azeradj-VOO. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Chenot, C.; Chanvalon, E. T. de; Janssens, P.; Collin, S.							Modulation of the sulfanylalkyl acetate/alcohol ratio and free thiol release from cysteinylated and/or glutathionylated sulfanylalkyl alcohols in beer under different fermentation conditions.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The occurrence of a substantial pool of cysteinylated and glutathionylated forms of polyfunctional thiols has been evidenced for several dual-purpose hop varieties, and so is the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast to release free thiols from these forms through fermentation. The present work aimed to investigate the effect of temperature, wort density, maturation time, and strain on the efficiency of free thiol release by S. cerevisiae yeasts. Model media at 12,15, or 17°P were spiked with three cysteinylated (Cys-) or three glutathionylated (G-) sulfanylalkyl alcohols (Cys-or G-3-sulfanylpentan-1-ol, 3-sulfanyl-4-methylpentan-1-ol, and 3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol), fermented for 7 days at 18,24, and 28 °C, and kept at 4°C for varying number of days. The released sulfanylalkyl alcohols and their corresponding acetates were extracted with a Ag-ion SPE cartridge and analyzed by gas chromatography-pulsed-flame photometric detection. The wort density and yeast strain greatly affected the acetate/alcohol ratio. This ratio varied from 1 to 80% according to the yeast strain and was at its highest at 17°P and 24 °C. Maturation appeared as the crucial step for free thiol excretion from yeast cells (no thiol was recovered in the fermented worts without maturation). Among the five yeasts tested, the yeast strain SafAle K-97 released the highest level of sulfanylalkyl alcohols into the medium (up to 0.45% of the added cysteinylated adducts and 0.08% of the glutathionylated adducts), whereas S-33 or S-04 should be preferred when release of esters is sought out (release efficiencies up to 0.35% from cysteinylated adducts and 0.02% from glutathionylated adducts are observed if both the alcohol and its acetate are considered).

Detection of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci and PVL/mecA genes in cefoxitin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (t044/ST80) from unpasteurized milk sold in stores in Djelfa, Algeria.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study was designed to determine antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes and virulence factors in Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS) in unpasteurized milk sold in Djelfa, Algeria. Eighty-two unpasteurized cow milk samples were randomly obtained from 82 retail stores in Djelfa and tested to detect staphylococci. Species were identified by biochemical tests and MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes and genotypes were determined by disk diffusion test, PCR, and sequencing. The Staph. aureus isolates were subjected to spa typing, multilocus sequence typing, and detection of virulence genes and the scn gene by PCR and sequencing. Forty-five (54.9%) milk samples were contaminated by staphylococci and 45 isolates were recovered: 10 Staph. aureus (12.2% of total samples) and 35 CNS (42.7%). Resistance to penicillin (blaZ), tetracycline (tetL/ tetK), and erythromycin (ermB/ msrA/ ermC) were the most common phenotypes (genotypes). Three CNS were methicillin-resistant and all were mecA-positive. The Staph. aureus isolates were ascribed to the following lineages [spa type/sequence type/associated clonal complex (number of isolates)]: t267/ST479/CC479 (n = 6), t1510/ST5651/CC45 (n = 1), t359/ST97/CC97/ (n = 1), t346/ST15/CC15 (n = 1), and t044/ST80 (n = 1). The mecA gene was detected in the cefoxitin-susceptible t044/ST80 isolate and co-harbored the lukF/lukS-PV and scn genes. The detection of mecA-PVL-positive Staph. aureus, methicillin-resistant CNS, and multidrug-resistant staphylococcal species indicates a potentially serious health issue and reveals that unpasteurized milk sold in Djelfa city could be a potential vehicle for pathogenic and antimicrobial-resistant staphylococci.

J		Chenshan Shi; Miaomiao Liu; Qinghua Ma; Tiantian Zhao; Lisong Liang; Bolin Zhang							Impact of tetrapeptide-FSEY on oxidative and physical stability of hazelnut oil-in-water emulsion.		Foods					This study investigates the antioxidant behaviors of a hazelnut tetrapeptide, FSEY (Phe-Ser-Glu-Tyr), in an oil-in-water emulsion. The emulsion was prepared with stripped hazelnut oil at a ratio of 10%. O/W emulsions, both with and without antioxidants (FSEY and TBHQ), were incubated at 37 °C. The chemical stabilities, including those of free radicals and primary and secondary oxidation productions, along with the physical stabilities, which include particle size, zeta-potential, color, pH, and DeltaBS, were analyzed. Consequently, FSEY displayed excellent antioxidant behaviors in the test system by scavenging free lipid radicals. Both primary and secondary oxidation products were significantly lower in the FSEY groups. Furthermore, FSEY assisted in stabilizing the physical structure of the emulsion. This antioxidant could inhibit the increase in particle size, prevent the formation of creaming, and stabilize the original color and pH of the emulsion. Consequently, FSEY may be an effective antioxidant additive to use in emulsion systems. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, we used the lytic Siphovirus phage LPST10 to develop a rapid and accurate detection method for Salmonella. Salmonella cells were separated from complex food matrices through magnetic separation, then subjected to SYBR green-based real-time quantitative PCR detection. Bacterial concentrations of 102-106 (Colony forming unit per milliliter, CFU/mL), with 200 of mug LPST10 phage-MBs, and 15 min reactions at 37 °C were found to be optimal to allow the phage-magnetic beads to capture the Salmonella cells. The phage-magnetic beads specifically recognized Salmonella cells of different serotypes. Under optimal conditions, DNA was extracted from the resulting bacteria phage-magnetic bead complexes through either alkaline lysis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) or boiling. The detection assay was subsequently assessed in food matrices (Tryptic soy broth medium, milk, and lettuce). The detection limit reached <30 CFU/mL in the food matrices. The entire assay, including bacterial capture, DNA extraction, and real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection, could be completed within 1.5 h.

Food & Function					The use of antimicrobial peptide (AMP), found in all forms of life and playing a pivotal role in the innate immune system, has been developed as a new strategy for maintaining intestinal health and reducing antibiotic usage due to its ability to resist pathogens and commensal microbes. The current study investigated the effects of L-threonine on beta-defensin expression, the intestinal mucosal barrier and inflammatory cytokine expression in porcine intestinal epithelial cell lines (IPEC-J2). The results revealed that in IPEC-J2 cells, L-threonine significantly increased the expression of beta-defensin (including pBD-1, pBD-2, and pBD-3) in a dose-and time-dependent manner (P< 0.05). By using different concentrations and treatment times of L-threonine, the results showed that the expression of beta-defensin was upregulated to the greatest extent in IPEC-J2 cells cultured with 1 mM L-threonine for 24 h. Although the mRNA expression levels of beta-defensins were markedly increased (P< 0.05), there was relatively little inducible pBD-1, pBD-2 and pBD-3 mRNA expression at the sub-confluent and confluent densities in comparison with post-confluent densities. Furthermore, we found that L-threonine enhanced the beta-defensin expression by suppressing the expression of SIRT1, which increased acetylated p65 expression, and activating the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, which induced the translocation of p65 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. In addition, L-threonine significantly prevented LPS-induced intestinal mucosal barrier damage by attenuating the decreasing tendency of the mRNA expression of Mucin1 and Mucin2 (P< 0.05). Simultaneously, L-threonine enhanced the expression of beta-defensins upon LPS challenge in IPEC-J2 cells (P< 0.05). L-Threonine obviously decreased the mRNA expression of inflammatory cytokines compared to that in untreated cells (P< 0.05). In conclusion, L-threonine can upregulate beta-defensin expression and reduce inflammatory cytokine expression in IPEC-J2 cells; meanwhile, L-threonine alleviates LPS-induced intestinal mucosal barrier damage in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. The L-threonine-mediated modulation of endogenous defensin expression may be a promising approach to reduce antibiotic use, enhance disease resistance and intestinal health in animals. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	13	5821	5836	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00269d					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14959
J		Chenxi Yang; Ziwei Liu; Meiying Zhang; Meng Wai Woo; Shuhui Li; Hua Xiong; Qiang Zhao							Effects of fermentable carbohydrates on the quality properties and in vitro digestibility of Yiyang rice cake.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Effects of adding resistant starch (RS), inulin (IN) and xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) on the cooking properties, texture properties, ordered structure of starch, water mobility and in vitro digestion of Yiyang rice cake were investigated. The cooking loss of rice cake was reduced to 2.8-4.6% with the addition of XOS. Addition of these fermentable carbohydrates increased the hardness, viscosity, chewiness and order of starch. As the content of carbohydrates increased, the rice cakes gradually became smoother. RS and XOS promoted the starch retrogradation and the free movement of water in the rice cakes, and increased the ordered structure formed by the association between starch chains; IN had no obvious effect on the retrogradation. Compared with the control group, digestion rate and final digestibility level of the starch digestion model in RS and XOS groups decreased, especially the total amount of available starch of XOS120 decreased to 73.8%, indicating that they had a certain inhibitory effect on starch digestion. The crystallinity formation theories for high-moisture starch gels are not applicable to rice cakes.

J		Chenxi Zhang; Xiaoyi Tan; Chenyan Lv; Jiachen Zang; Guanghua Zhao							Shrimp ferritin greatly improves the physical and chemical stability of astaxanthin.		Journal of Food Science					The low stability of trans-astaxanthin (AX) not only limits its applications as a functional factor in food systems, but also affects the sensor quality of most shrimp products. Therefore, it is important to find an easy, effective way to improve the physical and chemical stability of AX. In this study, by taking advantage of the co-existence of AX and shrimp ferritin (Marsupenaeus japonicus ferritin, MjF), we investigated the interaction of AX with MjF. Results. Showed that AX molecules are able to bind on the outer surface of MjF to form complexes, and quantitative analyses demonstrated that one ferritin molecule is bound to ~48 AX molecules. Consequently, such binding not only greatly enhances the water solubility, thermal stability, and photo stability of AX, but also protects AX from Fe2+-induced oxidative damage, as compared to free AX. Thus, MjF could be used as a protective molecule to improve the physical and chemical stability of AX. Practical Application. Our study opens up a new avenue for improving the physicochemical properties of bioactive molecules by interacting with protein, and shrimp ferritin could be explored as a protective system for the bioactive molecules. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	12	5295	5306	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.15945					FSTA:2022-04-Re1385

Food Microbiology					To investigate the persistence of acid tolerance response (ATR) and the regulatory mechanism during chilled storage, Salmonella ATCC 14028 and the DeltaphoP mutant were acid adapted and then incubated in meat extract at 4 °C for 24 days as simulated beef storage. The bacterial population, D values and expression of PhoP/PhoQ linked genes of both strains were determined at 6-day intervals. Although a mild suppression effect on the D values of adapted Salmonella was found during the long-time storage in meat extract at 4 °C, the D value of adapted strains was significantly higher than non-adapted strains, indicating the persistence of ATR during the whole aging and distribution of beef posing a threat to food safety. The fact that low temperature inhibits the formation of ATR at the early adapted stage emphasizes the importance of keeping a low-temperature environment during slaughter. An interaction between the acidic adaptation and phoP gene on D values was found and the expression levels of adiA, adiY, cadA and cadB genes was significantly reduced in the DeltaphoP mutant, suggesting that PhoP/Q system plays an important role in the ATR by sensing the pH and regulating lysine and arginine decarboxylation directly or indirectly.

Foods					This work aimed to improve the functional properties of soybean protein isolate (SPI) by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and develop SPI incorporated yogurt. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize the HHP treatment parameters, including pressure, holding time, and the ratio of SPI/water. Water holding capacity, emulsifying activity index, solubility, and hardness of SPI gels were evaluated as response variables. The optimized HPP treatment conditions were 281 MPa of pressure, 18.92 min of holding time, and 1:8.33 of SPI/water ratio. Water and oil holding capacity, emulsifying activity, and stability of SPI at different pH were improved. Additionally, relative lipoxygenase (LOX) activity of HHP treated SPI (HHP-SPI) was decreased 67.55 5.73%, but sulphydryl group content of HHP-SPI was increased 12.77%, respectively. When incorporating 8% of SPI and HHP-SPI into yogurt, the water holding capacity and rheological properties of yogurt were improved in comparison with yogurt made of milk powders. Moreover, HHP-SPI incorporated yogurt appeared better color and flavor. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chenxu Zhu; Ming Zhao; Haibo Zhang; Fang Zhang; Yuzhou Du; Mingxing Lu							Extending the storage time of Clanis bilineata tsingtauica (Lepidoptera; Sphingidae) eggs through variable-temperature cold storage.		Foods					Clanis bilineata tsingtauica Mell, 1922 (Lepidoptera, Sphingidae), also known as "Doudan" in China, is an important pest in legume crops. As an edible insect, it is most commonly consumed in Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan Provinces. Mass rearing requires access to large numbers of eggs. This stage, however, is of short duration and supplies are frequently not sufficient for insect production. Therefore, we identified the cold storage conditions for C. Bilineata tsingtauica that can effectively prolong the storage time of the eggs, to make supplies more readily available. We found that when stored at 4°C, only 7.5% of the eggs hatched after 7 days, while at 10°C the hatch rate was 78.3%. At 15°C, the egg hatch rate remained at this same level (77.8% even after 14-20 days). Considering various combinations, we found that optimal egg hatch occurred if eggs were stored at 15°C for 11 days, and then held at 15-20°C under dark conditions. Stored as described above, the egg hatch rate was not significantly different from the control group (at 28°C). These conditions allow for easier mass rearing of C. Bilineata tsingtauica by providing a stable supply of eggs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.										2021	10	11			2304-8158				10.3390/foods10112820					FSTA:2022-09-Sp4660
J		Chenxuan Wu; Jun Liu; Junwen Ma; Qiaojuan Yan; Zhengqiang Jiang							Neoagarotetraose extends the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans through AMPK mediated signaling pathways and activation of autophagy.		Journal of Functional Foods					Neoagarotetraose (NAT) has been reported to ameliorate aging-associated diseases. The present study found that NAT extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis (C.) elegans up to 21.9% and improved resistance to stresses of heat and oxidation. Moreover, using a series of C. elegans mutants, insulin/insulin-like signaling (IIS) was found to be involved in NAT mediated lifespan extension. Meanwhile, the extended lifespan by NAT was in part via AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which further enhanced the activity of DAF-16. NAT could lower ATP levels and act as a mimic of dietary restriction (DR) as evidenced by the involvement of nutrient sensing pathways, such as IIS, AMPK, and target of rapamycin (TOR). Moreover, NAT induced autophagy both in worms and in human embryonic lung fibroblast cells. Taken together, NAT could be potentially used as a DR mimic centered on AMPK. The results from this study provide new evidence for anti-aging effect of NAT in C. elegnas and insights into implication of anti-aging activity of NAT in higher organisms.

Journal of Functional Foods					Hyperphophorylation of tau protein is typical pathological features of Alzheimer's disease. Chicoric acid (CA) has been reported to inhibit formation of beta amyloid peptide, it's hard to transport through blood brain barrier (BBB) and its role in inhibiting tau phosphorylation is unknown. In this study, we employed ferritin as a nanocage to encapsulate CA (Ft-CA), and stability, cell survival and BBB permeability of CA were improved by ferritin encapsulation, suggesting ferritin to be an effective vector for bioactive molecules. Meanwhile, both CA and Ft-CA were proved to inhibit tau phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells, and effects of Ft-CA are more obvious than CA. Roles of CA were proposed to regulate glucose metabolism by increasing GluT1 and promote glycosylation of tau protein. Meanwhile, CA was proved to inhibit phosphorylation of AMPK, which may further inhibit tau phosphorylation. These findings may provide a novel strategy to prevent neurodegenerative diseases by using dietary polyphenols.

Food & Function					Rheumatoid arthritis is emerging as a chronic autoimmune disease worldwide. In this study, the beneficial effects of tuna oil (TO) on collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice were investigated. Dietary administration of TO relieved arthritis severity and joint bone erosion, and ameliorated systemic inflammation. Furthermore, TO treatments regulated the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) and Wnt1/beta-catenin signaling pathways in the joint, enhanced osteoblastogenesis biomarkers and suppressed osteoclastogenesis biomarkers, and subsequently re-balanced bone remodeling. Moreover, the impaired intestinal epithelial barrier was repaired after TO treatments, along with gut microbiota modulation. By employing fecal microbiota transplantation, we clarified that the beneficial effects of TO in CIA alleviation were mediated by the modulated gut microbiota. These results indicated that gut microbiota mediated the protective effects of tuna oil on collagen-induced arthritis in mice. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	12	5387	5398	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00709b					FSTA:2021-10-Ng2330

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. This study aims to investigate the protective effect of Apostichopus japonicus oligopeptide (AJOP) on hyperuricemia, demonstrate the modulation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microbiota, and clarify the underlying microbiota-dependent mechanism. Methods and Results. Hyperuricemic mice treated with AJOP and subjected to corresponding fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) are used to observe the beneficial effects of AJOP and microbiota. Gene transcriptions are measured using quantitative real-time PCR. The GIT (stomach, colon, cecum, and feces) microbiota is analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing and the short-chain fatty acids are detected using GC-MS. Dietary administration of AJOP significantly alleviates hyperuricemia, regulates uric acid metabolism, inhibites the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and NF-kappaB-related signaling pathway, and restores m6A methylation levels. In addition, substantial heterogeneity is observed in GIT microbiota. Furthermore, FMT effectively alleviates hyperuricemia in mice by selectively regulating the corresponding pathways associated with AJOP treatment, indicating that the mechanism underlying the protective effects of AJOP is partly microbiota-dependent. Conclusion. This study demonstrates that AJOP exerts a protective effect on hyperuricemic mice by regulating uric acid metabolism, resulting in substantial heterogeneity among the GIT microbiota, thus mediating the beneficial effects in a microbiota-dependent manner. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	14			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100147					FSTA:2021-11-Rg3917

Food & Function					Neointimal hyperplasia is the major cause of carotid stenosis after vascular injury, which restricts the long-term efficacy of endovascular treatment and endarterectomy in preventing stenosis. Ginsenoside Re (Re) Is a major active ingredient of ginseng having multifaceted pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular system, and is a potential treatment for restenosis. In this study, we demonstrated that Re treatment significantly inhibited vascular injury-induced neointimal thickening, reduced the intimal area and intima/media (I/M) ratio, increased the lumen area, and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines. In cultured A7R5 cells, Re inhibited LPS-induced proliferation and migration as evidenced by suppressed colony formation and shortened migration distance, accompanied by the downregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Re promoted VSMC apoptosis induced by balloon injury in vivo and LPS challenge in vitro. Moreover, Re inhibited autophagy in VSMCs evoked by balloon injury and LPS as supported by reduced LC3II and increased p62 expressions. Suppression of autophagy with the specific autophagy inhibitor spautin-1 efficiently inhibited LPS-induced cell proliferation and inflammation and promoted caspase-3/7 activities. Mechanistically, we found that Re attenuated Ras/ERK1/2 expression in VSMCs in vivo and in vitro. The MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 showed similar effects to Re on cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis, and the levels of autophagy and cytokines. In conclusion, we provided significant evidence that Re inhibited vascular injury-induced neointimal thickening probably by promoting VSMC apoptosis and inhibiting autophagy via suppression of the Ras/MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	15	6755	6765	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00015b					FSTA:2021-12-Ge6699

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effects of oleanolic acid (OA) on hepatic lipid metabolism and gut-liver axis homeostasis in an obesity-related non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) nutritional animal model and explored possible molecular mechanisms behind its effects. The results revealed that OA ameliorated the development of metabolic disorders, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis in obese rats. Meanwhile, OA restored high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and endotoxin-mediated induction of toll-like-receptor-4-related pathways, subsequently inhibiting endotoxemia and systemic inflammation and balancing the homeostasis of the gut-liver axis. OA also reshaped the composition of the gut microbiota of HFD-fed rats by reducing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and increasing the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Moringa oleifera is a nutritious herb with a pronounced harsh taste. During microbial fermentation of Fu-brick tea, "flowering" promotes the oxidation, decomposition, and hydrolysis of biochemical components, resulting in a unique flavor. To improve the utilization and flavor of Moringa leaves, we developed a novel blended tea. Moringa-Fu brick tea via microbial fermentation and dark tea blending. We investigated chemical compositions and fungal community structures, and their possible correlations, during eight flowering stages using three blending ratios. Metabolic analysis showed that caffeine, theophylline, and gallic acid levels increased, whereas other key metabolite levels decreased after flowering. The genera Aspergillus, Saccharomycetales incertae sedis, and Candida predominated during the early flowering stage, but Eurotium dominated after 3 days with all three ratios. The fungal taxa were grouped into 14 modules, and six keystone taxa were identified. Three fungal genera (Saccharomycetales incertae sedis, Aspergillus, and Cyberlindnera) were the core functional genera linked to the metabolism of biochemical compounds. Supplementing 15% moringa tea with dark tea developed the best flavor, suggesting that this substrate's environment was more suitable for propagating dominant fungi and driving biotransformation. This study can serve as an exemplar for utilizing microbial-fermentation to improve the flavors of harsh-tasting plant resources.

Food Bioscience					Highland barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important nutritious crop with high levels of phenolic and flavonoid. Thus, highland barley tea exhibits strong antioxidant activity. However, there are few studies on the nutritional properties and functional components of highland barley tea. In the present study, the protective effect and potential mechanisms of highland barley tea solution water-soluble (WS) and alcohol-soluble (AS) extracts on palmitic acid (PA)-induced apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction were investigated in C2C12 myocytes. The results revealed that both of WS and AS showed antioxidant activity, in which AS has a stronger antioxidative capacity. Meanwhile, AS treatment significantly suppresses PA-induced myocytes apoptosis. Furthermore, AS improves multiple mitochondrial bioactivities, repairing PA-induced mitochondrial injury, leading to a reconversion in the cellular ATP production, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. Mechanistically, we also found that AS could decrease PA-induced oxidative damage by promoting the expression of Sirt3 through increasing the phosphorylation of Adenosine 5′-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which also activated SIRT3/FoxO3a to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species (ROS). Taken together, our findings demonstrated that AS in highland barley tea could be used as a potential nutraceutical in reducing muscle oxidative damage.

European Food Research and Technology					During the ripening of three apricots cultivars ("Bargoug", "Chechi Bazza" and "Oud Rhayem") grown in two different geographical regions of Tunisia (Testour and Gafsa regions), the changes of tocopherols, tocotrienols and carotenoids contents were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with UV-Vis photo diode array detection. The total tocopherols content ranged to from (30.43 mg/100 g of oil) to (70.69 mg/100 g of oil) with 7 compounds identified as alpha-T, alpha-T3 beta-T, gamma-T, gamma-T3, delta-T and delta-T3 mainly consisted with gamma-T (28.8 to 44.6 mg/100 g of oil). Furthermore, all apricot varieties were found to be a good source of carotenoid compounds with beta-carotene as the major one ranging from 127 to 566 g/100 g of oil followed by alpha-carotene ranging from 25.7 to 81.8 g/100 g of oil and gamma-carotene ranging from 7.7 to 56.38 g/100 g of oil. Zeaxanthin and Lutein were found only in bitter apricot precisely at immature stage (14 DAP) with respectively 105.2 and 141.8 g/100 g of oil values. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Kinetic-thermodynamic study of the oxidative stability of Arbequina olive oils flavored with lemon verbena essential oil.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Arbequina extra-virgin olive oils were flavored with lemon verbena (Aloysia citrodora) essential oil (0.1-0.4%, w/w), being evaluated quality parameters (free acidity, peroxide value, UV-extinction coefficients), oxidative stability, antioxidant and total reducing capacity. The kinetic-thermodynamic nature of the lipid oxidation was evaluated by Rancimat (110-150 °C). The essential oil addition promoted the antioxidant and total reducing capacities but, unfortunately, increased primary and secondary related quality parameters. Moreover, flavoring decreased the oils' oxidative stability. The kinetic-thermodynamic data showed that unflavored oils had significantly lower oxidation reaction rates (0.055-0.06492 h-1), more negative temperature coefficient (-0.0268 °C-1), higher temperature acceleration factor (1.852), greater activation energy (82.7 kJ mol-1) and frequency factor (10.9*109 h-1), higher positive enthalpy of activation (79.4 kJmol-1), lower negative entropy of activation (-131.8 J mol-1K-1) and greater positive Gibbs free energy of activation (129.95-135.23 kJ mol-1), showing that oils' oxidation was negatively influenced by the essential oil incorporation. Overall, oxidation had a non-spontaneous, endothermic and endergonic nature. Finally, olive oils could be satisfactorily classified (principal component and linear discriminant analysis) according to the flavoring level, using quality-antioxidant-stability or kinetic-thermodynamic datasets. The latter showed a less predictive performance, although ensuring the full discrimination of unflavored from flavored oils. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Hence, the effect of storage at -18, 0, 2 and 4 °C for 3, 6 and 9 months during two harvest seasons (2017 and 2018) on sugars, organic acids, polyphenols and cell wall yields and composition of "Deglet Nour" Tunisian dates, were studied. Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (MIR) as a non-targeted method allowed to highlight a year effect on chemical composition and to discriminate samples stored at 4 and 2 °C regarding to major components (moisture, sugars, organic acids.). Cell wall yields were stable during the time. However, galactose from pectin side chains decreased with time, causing an increase of lignin, cellulosic glucose, fucose and rhamnose. Procyanidins, accounting for 98% of total polyphenols, were not affected by storage. Regarding quality parameters stability, stored fruits at -18 °C could be the solution for a long term storage but due to its high energetic costs, 2 °C must be the optimal temperature with a lower time.

Physiological and molecular characterization of the differential response of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. Italica) cultivars reveals limiting factors for broccoli tolerance to drought stress.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Broccoli is a cruciferous crop rich in health-promoting metabolites. Due to several factors, including anthropogenic global warming, aridity is increasing in many cultivation areas. There is a great demand to characterize the drought response of broccoli and use this knowledge to develop new cultivars able to maintain yield under water constraints. The aim of this study is to characterize the drought response at the physiological and molecular level of different broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. Var. Italica Plenck) cultivars, previously characterized as drought-sensitive or drought-tolerant. This approach aims to identify different traits, which can constitute limiting factors for drought stress tolerance in broccoli. For this purpose, we have compared several physiological parameters and the complete profiles of amino acids, primary metabolites, hormones, and ions of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive cultivars under stress and control conditions. We have found that drought-tolerant cultivars presented higher levels of methionine and abscisic acid and lower amounts of urea, quinic acid, and the gluconic acid lactone. Interestingly, we have also found that a drought treatment increases the levels of most essential amino acids in leaves and in florets. Our results have established physiological and molecular traits useful as distinctive markers to predict drought tolerance in broccoli or which could be reliably used for breeding new cultivars adapted to water scarcity. We have also found that a drought treatment increases the content of essential amino acids in broccoli.

J		Cheyns, K.; Demaegdt, H.; Waegeneers, N.; Ruttens, A.							Intake of food supplements based on algae or cyanobacteria may pose a health risk due to elevated concentrations of arsenic species.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Despite the health benefits of food supplements (FS) based on algae or cyanobacteria, the elevated arsenic (As) concentrations in these FS may raise a health concern. In the present study 33 FS containing algae or cyanobacteria were collected and As (species) were analysed to estimate consumer exposure. Based on hazard and exposure data, potential risks were evaluated using inorganic arsenic (Asi) and the potentially toxic As fraction (Astot minus arsenobetaine (AB)). Astot concentrations were in the range 0.053-57 mg/kg with highest concentrations in FS containing brown algae. Asi concentrations were in the range <0.02-4.7 mg kg-1. A large part of As in FS containing algae or cyanobacteria was identified as potentially toxic AsSugars species. Negligible amounts of AB were detected. According to a tentative risk evaluation, the intake of Asi related to all FS collected was of no health concern for the general population. In 8 out of 33 of the analysed FS, however, the Asi concentration was of concern for population groups with increased cancer risks. If all As species except the non-toxic AB were taken into consideration, only 26 out of 33 of the FS showed "no concern" for the general population, while for the other 7 FS a potential health risk was identified. This study indicates the need to obtain more data on toxicity of AsSugars and to develop limits for As (species) in FS. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Bidan kiwifruit on amyloid beta-induced neuronal damages in PC-12 cells and ICR mice.		Journal of Functional Foods					The positive effects of Actinidia eriantha cv. Bidan extract (AEE) were investigated in terms of improvement in Abeta1-42-induced cognitive impairment. AEE was shown to have neuroprotective effects, such as reduction in intracellular reactive oxygen species levels and suppression of apoptotic cell death, in neuron-like PC-12 cells. Results of the in vivo experiment showed that AEE at 200 and 1,000 mg/kg body weight/day, and even at 50 mg/kg body weight/day, reduced impairments in learning and spatial memory in Abeta1-42-treated ICR mice. Furthermore, the endogenous antioxidant systems (SOD, CAT, and GSH/GSSG) in the mouse brain tissue significantly (p< 0.05) increased by AEE administration compared with the group treated with only Abeta1-42. In the analysis of UPLC-Q-TOF mass spectrometry, caffeic acid derivatives such as caffeoylquinic acids were identified in AEE. These results suggest that the Bidan kiwifruit is a good source of antioxidant phenolics that hold the potential to improve cognitive function.

Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					This study comprehensively presents the relationship between the bioactive substance of 70% (v/v) aqueous ethanol extract of 38 species of seaweeds (swes), and anti-glycation activities. The contents of bioactive substance of swes, such as total phenolic, total flavonoid and condensed tannins, were determined through a colorimetric analysis. Among the tested species,Ecklonia bicyclis, Ishige foliacea, and Cladophora urightianavar. minor had the highest amount of total phenolic (255.75 mg gae/g dw), total condensed tannins (63.36 mg ce/g dw), and total flavonoid content (85.26 mg ce/g dw), respectively. Anti-glycation properties of swes were evaluated through advanced glycation end-products (ages) formation, ages-collagen cross-link formation, and ages-collagen cross-link breaking assay. Brown algae species exhibited a more prominent inhibitory activity on ages formation and ages-collagen cross-links, and the breaking of ages-collagen cross-links compared to that exhibited by aminoguanidine and alt-711 (positive controls). Using principal component analysis, we confirmed that the ages formation inhibitory property and ages-collagen cross-links breaking activity were closely correlated with total phenolic and the condensed tannin contents contained in swes. Therefore, the bioactive substances such as phenolics and condensed tannins in seaweeds can be used as predictive indices in selecting compounds for the development of a therapeutic agent that prevents diabetic complications related to the ages. In addition, our results suggest that brown algae species, which contains more bioactive substances than green and red algae species, can be utilized as a promising natural resource for the prevention and alleviation of ages-related diabetic complications as age inhibitor and cross-links breaker. ©the author (s), under exclusive licence to springer science+business media, llc, part of springer nature 2021.										2021	76	3	326	333	0921-9668				10.1007/s11130-021-00908-5					FSTA:2022-04-Rg1436

The sensory and flavor characteristics of Shaoxing Huangjiu (Chinese rice wine) were significantly influenced by micro-oxygen and electric field.		Food Science & Nutrition					In order to improve the high cost of equipment and difficult management caused by the natural aging of Chinese rice wine (Huangjiu), micro-oxygen (MO) and electric field (PEF) technology are used to accelerate the aging of Huangjiu. The results showed that micro-oxygen and electric field have a significant effect on the sensory characteristics and flavor characteristics of Huangjiu. Compared with the naturally aged Huangjiu, the flavor compounds of Huangjiu treated with micro-oxygen and electric field increase significantly. Based on principal component analysis, Huangjiu processed at 0.35mg L/day or 0.5mg L/day combined electric field exhibited similar flavor to the natural aged Huangjiu, which was highly associated with long-chain fatty acid ethyl esters (C13-C18). Moreover, partial least squares regression demonstrated that sensory attributes of cereal aroma and astringency were highlighted after aging time, while fruit aroma, continuation, and full body were dominant after micro-oxygen and electric field treatment. Micro-oxygen and electric field effectively enhanced the quality of Huangjiu, which could be applied in other alcoholic beverages. © 2021 The Authors.

J.; Wei Liu							Utilization of polysaccharide-based high internal phase emulsion for nutraceutical encapsulation: enhancement of carotenoid loading capacity and stability.		Journal of Functional Foods					The main goal of the present work was to access the ability of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) to encapsulate beta-carotene. The carotenoid loading capacity of the HIPEs was around 20-fold higher when OSA-starch/chitosan complexes were used than when only OSA-starch was used. This impact could be mainly assigned to the capacity of the former HIPEs to trap carotenoid crystals in a stable form. The OSA-starch/chitosan complexes were shown to absorb on the oil droplets interface and form a 3D network in the aqueous phase, which helped to prevent droplet coalescence induced by beta-carotene crystal. The incorporation of beta-carotene within the oil droplets enhanced its resistance to chemical degradation when exposed to heat, ultraviolet radiation, or gastrointestinal conditions. Our results provide information that may aid the design and development of edible soft solids containing high carotenoid levels, which may be applied in food and pharmaceutical industry.

Food Bioscience					Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) is a probiotic strain that has exhibited probiotic properties in the prevention and treatment of intestinal flora imbalance. In order to investigate the morphological differences and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of simulated gastrointestinal digested soybean protein isolate (dpro22) and digested soybean peptide (dpep) treatment on L. rhamnosus, microscopic observation and iTRAQ-based proteomics and bioinformatics analysis were performed. 1462 proteins were identified, and differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were screened accurately, including 66 DAPs in the dpep group compared with the Man Rogosa Sharpe broth (M) group and 66 DAPs in the dpep/dpro group. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that DAPs in dpep/M and dpep/dpro mainly differed in cellular carbohydrate and nitrogen compound catabolic processes and transport. Some of the DAPs overlapped in the three comparison groups might be pivotal proteins involved in growth and morphologic changes of the dpep and dpro treatments.

Food Chemistry					Type 3 resistant starch (RS3) was developed from Canna edulis (Ce) native starch (NS) through dual enzymatic hydrolysis and recrystallization. Thereafter, the processed Ce-RS3 was subjected to systematic characterizations for its structural properties, anti-hyperlipidemic effect, and in vivo gut microbiota modulatory function. The Ce-RS3 content was increased to 49.11% after processing under optimal conditions. Compared with NS, Ce-RS3 maintained its B-type crystallization without introducing new chemical groups. Meanwhile, it displayed coarse surfaces, higher crystallinity, more ordered structures, and a higher proportion of chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 37-100. Ce-RS3 intervention significantly alleviated dyslipidemia in hyperlipidemic mice, which was associated with increased gut microbial diversity and unique microbial enrichment, potentially mediated by its fine structure. These observations are valuable for developing RS3 from C. edulis for prebiotics applications and support the potential strategy that utilizes well-designed RS to modulate specific bacterial populations to improve health.

Food Chemistry					The essential oil extracted from the black Piper nigrum L. (BPEO) was analyzed for antioxidant, hepatoprotective and antifungal activities. BPEO is rich in total phenolics, total flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, and showed good free radicals and lipid peroxidation scavenging capacities. In a CCl4-induced liver injury mice model, the BPEO treated groups showed increases in the catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activities present in the liver and kidney, and reverses the CCl4-elevated total bilirubin (TBIL), glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (AKP) and malondialdehyde (MDA) level, which were confirmed in further analyses of kidney tissue sections. BPEO can effectively inhibit the growth of Aspergillus flavus spoilage fungus in maize. Further analyses indicated that BPEO disrupt the permeability barrier of the cell membrane and lead to mitochondrial dysfunction in A. flavus. Therefore, the current study proved BPEO's potential as hepatoprotective products and natural food preservatives.

Journal of Food Quality					The effect of an antioxidative peptide Met-Lys-Ala-Val-Cys-Phe-Ser-Leu (MKAVCFSL) on oxidative stress in Caco-2 cell lines was investigated. Caco-2 cells exposed to excess oxidative stress could be restored when pretreated with the peptide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) within the cells could be scavenged by MKAVCFSL. The peptide could also enhance the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), and superoxide dismutase (SOD), while catalase (CAT) activity did not show a significant difference between treatment and control samples. Meanwhile, it was observed that peptide treatment increased the concentration of glutathione (GSH). Yet the content of glutathione disulfide (GSSG) was hardly affected. The stability of MKAVCFSL was also assessed and an intact peptide was observed after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Part of the peptide was hydrolyzed into fragments including MKA, FSL, AVCFSL, and MKAVCF. This study demonstrated that MKAVCFSL derived from bighead carp hydrolysates could ameliorate oxidative stress to protect the Caco-2 cells.

Journal of Functional Foods					The purpose of this study was to investigate whether soybean protein isolates (SPIs2PEP: soybean peptides; dPEPs: digested soybean peptides; SPIs: soybean protein isolates; dSPIs: digested soybean protein isolates; MRS: Man Rogosa Sharpe broth; LN: MRS reduced nitrogen content by half; LN+PEP: LN supplemented with an equivalent nitrogen content from soybean peptides; LN+SPI: LN supplemented with an equivalent nitrogen content from soybean protein isolates; LN+dPEP: LN supplemented with an equivalent nitrogen content from digested soybean peptides; LN+dSPI: LN supplemented with an equivalent nitrogen content from digested soybean protein isolates and soybean peptides (PEPs), as well as their hydrolysates after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (dSPIs and dPEPs), can promote the growth and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) in vitro under mono-culture and co-culture with Escherichia coli (E. coli). We found that all the treatment groups could enhance the viable cell numbers, while the effects of PEP and dPEP occurred earlier than those of SPI and dSPI, and the production of SCFAs was improved mainly by the dPEP and dSPI groups in mono-culture. In the co-culture system, dPEP weakened the competitiveness of E. coli and improved the competitive capacity of L. rhamnosus, and the viable cell numbers of L. rhamnosus were higher than the numbers in the treated mono-culture after 8h and 12h of cultivation.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2) is a key enzyme in the production of polyunsaturated fatty acids in plants. RNAi technology can reduce the expression of FAD2 genes in Brassica napus seeds and acquire transgenic B. napus plants with a high oleic acid content, but the effect of seed-specific inhibition of FAD2 expression on B. napus seed metabolites is not clear. Here we use widely targeted metabolomics to investigate the metabolites of normal-oleic-acid rapeseed (OA) and high-oleic-acid rapeseed (HOA) seeds, resulting in a total of 726 metabolites being detected. Among them, 24 differential metabolites were significantly downregulated and 88 differential metabolites were significantly upregulated in HOA rapeseed. In further lipid profile experiments, more lipids in B. napus seeds were accurately quantified. The contents of glycolipids and phospholipids that contain C18:1 increased significantly and C18:2 decreased because FAD2 expression was inhibited. The changes in the expression of key genes in related pathways were also consistent with the changes in metabolites. The insertion site of the ihpRNA plant expression vector was reconfirmed through genome wide resequencing, and the transgenic event did not change the sequence of FAD2 genes. There was no significant difference in the germination rate and germination potential between OA and HOA rapeseed seeds because the seed-specific ihpRNA plant expression vector did not affect other stages of plant growth. This work provides a theoretical and practical guidance for subsequent molecular breeding of high OA B. napus.										2021	69	19	5452	5462	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06867					FSTA:2021-09-Js11943

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Shrimp allergy is a critical public health concern worldwide, and is also the most frequent cause of food allergy in Taiwan. Tropomyosin is recognized as the major shrimp allergen. However, information of tropomyosin content in Taiwanese shrimp is unknown. Therefore, it is an urgent need to develop a reliable analytical approach to detect tropomyosin. An absolute quantification method of proteins (AQUA) method was developed to detect tropomyosin in seven Taiwanese shrimps in this study. Both signature peptide, ALSNAEGEVAALNR, and its isotope-labeled peptide were used as standards and internal standards. The determination coefficient (R2) of the calibration curve is 0.9989, and the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.072 ng/mul and 0.219 ng/mul, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day precision of this analytical method are 2.30-12.80% and 2.93-11.97%, respectively. Recovery was measured as 85.53-101.87% by adding signature peptide with 0.5, 1.0, 7.5 ng/mul into the blank matrix. The method showed no cross-reactivity with squid, tilapia and chicken. Also, the current validated method was successfully applied to shrimps and processed foods. The levels of tropomyosin in seven Taiwanese shrimps ranged from 555.50 to 973.93 mug/g. The present study demonstrated this analytical approach may be an useful technique to analyze tropomyosin in foods.

J		Chi-Yuan Cheng; Brinzari, T. V.; Zhigang Hao; Xiaotai Wang; Long Pan							Understanding methyl salicylate hydrolysis in the presence of amino acids.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Methyl salicylate, the major flavor component in wintergreen oil, is commonly used as food additives. It was found that amino acids can unexpectedly expedite methyl salicylate hydrolysis in an alkaline environment, while the detailed mechanism of this reaction merits investigation. Herein, the role of amino acid, more specifically, glycine, in methyl salicylate hydrolysis in aqueous solution was explored. 1H NMR spectroscopy, combined with density functional theory calculations, was employed to investigate the methyl salicylate hydrolysis in the presence and absence of glycine at pH 9. The addition of glycine was found to accelerate the hydrolysis by an order of magnitude at pH 9, compared to that at pH 7. The end hydrolyzed product was confirmed to be salicylic acid, suggesting that glycine does not directly form an amide bond with methyl salicylate via aminolysis. Importantly, our results indicate that the ortho-hydroxyl substituent in methyl salicylate is essential for its hydrolysis due to an intramolecular hydrogen bond, and the carboxyl group of glycine is crucial to methyl salicylate hydrolysis. This study gains a new understanding of methyl salicylate hydrolysis that will be helpful in finding ways of stabilizing wintergreen oil as a flavorant in consumer food products that also contain amino acids.										2021	69	21	6013	6021	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00958					FSTA:2021-10-Te3715

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Genus Pleurotus spp. contains many edible fungi with high nutritional value, medicinal value, and ease of growth. Cultivation of Pleurotus faces many problems including poor quality of mushroom spawn, low biological efficiency, and slow growth. In this study, we performed species identification using ITS marker and antioxidant capacity evaluation on 27 Pleurotus mycelia strains from MARDI's mushroom bank. Furthermore, important characteristics such as biological efficiency, complete growth, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated for 10 selected fruiting bodies of Pleurotus pulmonarius. Strain MP34 was the most suitable strain for commercial production, whereas mycelial strain MP42, MP52, and MP28 were suitable for the extraction of biologically active compounds. Our findings contributed and identified high-quality strains for the local Malaysian mushroom farmers. Future studies will focus on parameters such as substrate and supplements selection and bag preparation for the improvement of Pleurotus cultivation. Novelty impact statement. This study evaluated the potential of using ITS markers and antioxidant profiling to identify high-quality Pleurotus strain, which can be subsequently used for the quality control of Pleurotus mycelia culture in the mushroom bank and even by the farmer. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15554					FSTA:2021-10-Jq13809

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The contamination of mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) in foods has been reported worldwide, resulting in potential risks to food safety. However, the toxic mechanism of ZEN on neurodegenerative diseases has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study conducted in vivo ZEN neurotoxicity assessment on Parkinson's disease (PD)-related dopaminergic neurodegeneration and mitochondrial dysfunction using Caenorhabditis elegans. The results demonstrated that dopaminergic neuron damage was induced by ZEN exposure (1.25, 10, and 50 muM), and dopaminergic neuron-related behaviors were adversely affected subsequently. Additionally, the mitochondrial fragmentation was significantly increased by ZEN exposure. Moreover, upregulated expression of mitochondrial fission and cell apoptosis-related genes (drp-1, egl-1, ced-4, and ced-3) revealed the crucial role of DRP-1 on ZEN-induced neurotoxicity, which was further confirmed by drp-1 mutant and RNAi assays. In conclusion, our study indicates ZEN-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration via DRP-1-involved mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis, which might cause harmful effects on PD-related symptoms.										2021	69	40	12030	12038	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05836					FSTA:2022-02-Cd0429
J		Chia-Hao Chang; Meng-Ling Tsai; Ting-Ting Huang; Yu-Chun Wang							Authentication of fish species served in conveyor-belt sushi restaurants in Taiwan using DNA barcoding.		Food Control					Fish fraud is a problem worldwide. Not only does it erode customer confidence, but it also jeopardizes public health. Typically, it is difficult to authenticate fish species identity based on morphological characters after food processing. Fortunately, DNA is relatively resistant to processing methods, and DNA barcoding has proven useful for species identification. Although fishery product mislabeling is recognized as an issue in Taiwan, a respective study on sushi has not yet been conducted. Here, we successfully DNA-barcoded 121 out of 122 sushi samples from eleven chain restaurants of the conveyor-belt type in Taiwan, revealing an overall mislabeling rate of ~17.36%. We found that capelin roe is commonly used to replace other fish roe, such as herring. Tuna, which is susceptible to fraud, was always correctly labeled. We also noted inconsistent usage of Chinese common names, conflict between Chinese and English names, and ambiguous usage of Japanese kanji in Chinese labels, all serving to confuse species identity. Moreover, spurious reference sequences in the BOLD database and the lack of a standard list of common names of fishes with their corresponding scientific name both impede investigations of fish substitution. We advocate that the responsible authorities establish a reliable barcoding database for molecular authentication of fishes, publish a respective standard for common and scientific names, and legislate for more comprehensive labeling regulations based on experience in other jurisdictions to facilitate mislabeling investigations and to deter food fraud.

J		Chia-Hao Chang; Yueh-Tzu Kao; Ting-Ting Huang; Yu-Chun Wang							Product authentication using two mitochondrial markers reveals inconsistent labeling and substitution of canned tuna products in the Taiwanese market.		Foods					Fish of the tribe Thunnini represent a significant proportion of the stock caught by the fishing industry, with many of these fishes being collectively called tuna. However, only certain species can be used legally as an ingredient in canned tuna products, depending on regional food regulations. In Taiwan, only Thunnus species or Katsuwonus pelamis can be used as canned tuna. Here, we authenticated 90 canned tuna products, including 25 cat food samples, by sequencing two mitochondrial regions, 16S rRNA (16S) and the control region (CR). BLAST analysis revealed that Sarda orientalis, Euthynnus affinis, Auxis rochei, and Auxis thazard are all used as substitutes for legitimate tuna products. We found that 63.33% of investigated samples are true canned tuna, i.e., contain Thunnus species or skipjack tuna. We advocate that the Taiwanese government publishes an official standardized list of fishes, especially so that scientific, Chinese and vernacular names can be assigned unambiguously based on a "one species-one name policy", thereby clarifying which species can be used in seafood products such as tuna. Furthermore, we feel that the large-scale and long-term monitoring of canned tuna products is warranted to fully assess the extent of tuna product adulteration in Taiwan. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chia-Hsuan Chou; Chung-Yi Wang; Yuan-Tay Shyu; Sz-Jie Wu							The effect of high-pressure processing on reducing the glycaemic index of atemoya puree.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This study investigated the effects of high-pressure processing (HPP) on the glycaemic index (GI) of atemoya puree (AP) in rats. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with unprocessed and high-pressure processed atemoya puree (HPP-AP), and the GIs for the unprocessed AP and HPP-AP were calculated from changes in blood glucose concentrations within 2h after meals. The physicochemical properties of AP were analysed to understand the mechanism affecting its GI. Results. The results showed that HPP (600MPa for 15min) could delay increase in postprandial blood glucose levels, decrease the peak value of postprandial blood glucose by 76.1%, and significantly decrease the GI of AP to 49.8 in the experimental group compared to 65.4 in the control group. HPP did not exert a significant effect on the glucose and pectin contents of AP, but it increased the viscosity of the puree and its dietary fibre content and delayed the time of peak glucose response. In the analysis of enzymes of the puree, we found that HPP significantly decreased the activities of sucrose invertase, pectin methylesterase and polygalacturonase, thereby decreasing the rate of glucose generation in the puree and stabilizing the pectin structure, which decreased the absorption of glucose by the small intestine, thus decreasing the GI value.

J		Chia-I Jen; Chun-Han Su; Ming-Nan Lai; Lean-Teik Ng							Comparative anti-inflammatory characterization of selected fungal and plant water soluble polysaccharides.		Food Science and Technology Research					beta-Linked water soluble polysaccharides are important bioactive components of mushrooms and plants, they possess various biological activities, such as anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, anti-tumor and others. This study aimed to examine the comparative anti-inflammatory effects of five different beta-linked water soluble polysaccharides from fungi and plants [i.e. Xylaria nigripes (XN), Grifola frondosa (GF), Lentinula edodes (Len), Laminaria digitata (Lam) and Hordeum vulgare (BG)] in lipopolysaccharides-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Although the selected five polysaccharides showed different potencies in anti-inflammatory activity, XN exhibited the strongest inhibitory effects on NO, TNF-alpha and IL-6 production, and iNOS and COX-2 expression, whereas the inhibitory activity of BG was the weakest. Among the polysaccharides with beta-(13, 16) glucose linkages and triple-helix structures, the inhibition of GF and Len on TNF-alpha and IL-6 production was weaker than XN and Lam. This study concludes that the monosaccharide composition, glycosidic linkage and tertiary conformation were the main factors affecting the anti-inflammatory activity of polysaccharides, and polysaccharides with beta-(13, 16) glycosidic linkages possessed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than beta-(13, 14)-linked polysaccharides.										2021	27	3	453	462	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.27.453					FSTA:2022-01-Jq0612

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Consumer awareness and distaste towards both bacterial and chemical contaminations on food items have been increasing in recent years. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) is a cutting-edge technology which has been shown to effectively inactivate bacteria on the treated foods. Although the general NTP with a single plasma jet is appropriate for the continuous operation process, it suffers limitations due to its smaller scanning area. Here, a novel NTP device with a double rotary nozzle jet system was utilized, which could treat an area instead of a point. The shell eggs inoculated with Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (SE) were placed on a moving platform under the double rotary nozzle jet system. The efficacy of the NTP treatment on microbial decontamination was evaluated by testing a total of 26 combinations of operating parameters consisting of various plasma power (150, 180, 210 W), argon flow rate (10, 15, 20 slm), repetition of the moving platform (4, 6, 8 times), and speed of the moving platform (5, 10 mm/s). Although significantly higher SE reduction (p< 0.05) was achieved with higher power, more repetitions, larger argon flow rates, and lower speed of the platform, these parameters induced significant alterations in the sensory properties of the treated eggs. By comprehensively considering the bacterial reductions, egg quality, and sensory properties, NTP treatment with combination T (180 W-15 slm-6 times-10 mm/s) was determined to be the optimal parameter, which achieved >4 log CFU/egg of SE reduction and significantly better sensory properties than commercially washed eggs (p< 0.05). Additionally, SEM analysis revealed that NTP treatment with combination T resulted in less damage to egg cuticles compared to commercially washed eggs. This novel NTP device offers an efficient antibacterial activity under shorter exposure time (30 s), smaller argon flow rate (15 slm), and lower power (180 W) without adversely affecting the overall quality of the treated eggs. Therefore, this NTP device equipped with the double rotary jet system possesses a potential solution for future industrial applications.

J		Chia-Min Lin; Herianto, S.; Shih-Ming Syu; Cian-Huei Song; Hsiu-Ling Chen; Chih-Yao Hou							Applying a large-scale device using non-thermal plasma for microbial decontamination on shell eggs and its effects on the sensory characteristics.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Concerns related to foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) necessitate the decontamination of eggs. Multiple studies have successfully demonstrated the use of non-thermal plasma (NTP) technology in inactivating SE on artificially inoculated shell eggs. However, the NTP devices abovementioned were operated in the batch mode and small scale. The present study is the first attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of a large-scale device using NTP for egg decontamination. The designed NTP was operated at 400 W (power), 30 slm (Ar flow rate), 5 and 10 eggs/min (speed of conveyor belt), and 4 cm (distance between the plasma jets and egg samples). Conducting a two-round treatment for the egg samples at 400 W-30 slm-5 eggs/min-4 cm achieved the highest reduction of SE populations (3.57 log CFU/egg). SEM observation revealed less damage on the surface of the plasma-treated eggs than the commercial-washed eggs. Overall, NTP treatment can maintain the freshness quality and sensory characteristics until 15-day storage. This study demonstrated a large-scale NTP system was able to effectively achieve a significant reduction of pathogenic SE without adversely affecting egg quality properties. These results suggested the readiness of this NTP device for industrial applications.

Food Science & Nutrition					Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers. It has a high mortality rate and requires novel effective drugs and therapeutic approaches. Juniperus communis (JCo), used to flavor gin and food, has been documented to have anti-tumor activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the antitumor activity of JCo extract against ESCC and its possible mechanisms. JCo extract suppressed cell growth in ESCC and showed higher selection for ESCC cells than normal cells compared to the clinical drug 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). JCo extract induced cell cycle arrest at the G/G1 phase by regulating the expression of p53/p21 and CDKs/cyclins, triggering cell apoptosis by activating both the extrinsic (Fas/FasL/Caspase 8) and intrinsic (Bcl-2/Bax/Caspase 9) apoptosis pathways. Moreover, a combination treatment of JCo and 5-FU synergistically inhibited proliferation of ESCC cells. These results suggest that JCo extract is a potential natural therapeutic agent for esophageal cancer, as it could induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ESCC cells. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Chia-Yu Tsui; Chun-Yao Yang							Evaluation of semi-solid-state fermentation of Elaeocarpus serratus L. leaves and black soymilk by Lactobacillus plantarum on bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity.		Foods					Elaeocarpus serratus L. leaves (EL) containing phenolic compounds and flavonoids, including myricitrin with pharmacological properties, could be valorized as nutritional additive in foods. In this study, the semi-solid-state fermentation of EL and black soymilk (BS) by Lactobacillus plantarum BCRC 10357 was investigated. Without adding EL in MRS medium, the beta-glucosidase activity of L. plantarum quickly reduced to 2.33 0.15 U/mL in 36 h of fermentation; by using 3% EL, the stability period of beta-glucosidase activity was prolonged as 12.94 0.69 U/mL in 12 h to 13.71 0.94 in 36 h, showing positive response of the bacteria encountering EL. Using L. plantarum to ferment BS with 3% EL, the beta-glucosidase activity increased to 23.78 1.34 U/mL in 24 h, and in the fermented product extract (FPE), the content of myricitrin (2297.06 mug/g-FPE) and isoflavone aglycones (daidzein and genistein, 474.47 mug/g-FPE) at 48 h of fermentation were 1.61-fold and 1.95-fold of that before fermentation (at 0 h), respectively. Total flavonoid content, myricitrin, and ferric reducing antioxidant power in FPE using BS and EL were higher than that using EL alone. This study developed the potential fermented product of black soymilk using EL as a nutritional supplement with probiotics. © 2021 by the authors.

Shockwave processing of beef brisket in conjunction with sous vide cooking: effects on protein structural characteristics and muscle microstructure.		Food Chemistry					We studied the effect of shockwave processing and subsequent sous vide cooking on meat proteins (molecular size and thermal stability) and muscle structures (molecular, micro- and ultrastructure). Beef briskets were subjected to shockwave (11 kJ/pulse) and were sous vide-cooked at 60 °C for 12 h. Shockwave processing alone decreased the enthalpy and thermal denaturation temperature of the connective tissue proteins (second peak in the DSC thermogram, p< 0.05) compared to the control raw samples, while the protein gel electrophoresis profile remained unaffected. It led to disorganisation of the sarcomere structure and also modified the protein secondary structure. More severe muscle fibre coagulation and denaturation were observed in the shockwave-treated cooked meat compared to the cooked control. The results show that shockwave processing, with and without sous vide cooking, promotes structural changes in meat, and thus may have the potential to improve the organoleptic quality of the tough meat cuts.

Exploring the botanical composition of polyfloral and monofloral honeys through DNA metabarcoding.		Food Control					Honey is prone to commercial fraud. It is in the interest of producers and consumers alike that its authenticity and origin be guaranteed. To this end, conventional melissopalynological analysis could be coupled with DNA metabarcoding of the plant sources for correct botanical identification of the product. This is especially relevant for the Italian market, which produces more than 30 different types of high-quality honey. For this study, the chloroplastic trnL marker was used in DNA barcoding analysis of 111 honey samples of different origin: non-Italian (n=9); Italian polyfloral (n=17), and Italian monofloral (n=85). DNA metabarcoding analysis of the 85 Italian monofloral samples identified reads matching the label declaration in 72 samples, while 13 did not match, requiring further analysis to ascertain possible mislabeled events. This approach provides a powerful tool to help the authentication of the designation of origin of honey products and to assist melissopalynological analysis.

[6]-Gingerol dose-dependent toxicity, its role against lipopolysaccharide insult in sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus Lamarck), and antimicrobial activity.		Food Bioscience					Ginger (Zingiber officinale, fam: Zingiberaceae) is a plant whose rhizome is used by humans as a spice or anti-inflammatory and antioxidant. It is composed of many constituents, though the majority are gingerols and shogaols. Although the bioactive components have been found, the mechanisms of action of the single components still need to be determined. Ginger compounds may be toxic at high doses, and therefore its use as a food/drug requires better guidelines. This study focuses on one of the major ginger compounds, the [6]-gingerol, and the relationships between the dosage used and the effects on sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus. Toxicity tests with morphological and viability evaluations were done on embryos and adult immune cells. A dose-dependent toxic effect of [6]-gingerol was observed. It increased the number of abnormal morphologies and reduced the size of embryos up to 100% with the dose of 100 muM. Cell viability of immune cells gradually decreased over time, up to 40% with 50 muM after 6 h. The expression of genes coding for inflammatory (Pl-NF-kB, Pl-Tlr4, Pl-tbk1, Pl-jun) and stress responsive (Pl-grp78, Pl-XPB-ERCC3) proteins were measured in immune cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide after [6]-gingerol pre-treament. The results suggested that low doses of [6]-gingerol (10 and 20 muM) might confer protection to sea urchin immune cells. Different doses of [6]-gingerol (10, 20, and 50 muM) tested on three different non-pathogenic bacteria did not show any antimicrobial effects. The results suggested that [6]-gingerol might be beneficial as a functional food. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Exploring the feasibility of developing novel gelatin powders from salted, dried cannonball jellyfish (Stomolophus meleagris).		Food Bioscience					Cannonball jellyfish, often commercialized as salted, dried jellyfish (SDJ), is an emerging fishery in the USA and a great source of collagen, which can be utilized for developing novel marine gelatin powders. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of producing gelatin powders with gelling properties from SDJ using a mild acid hydrolysis and freeze-drying procedure as well as to evaluate their physico-chemical properties. The findings revealed that the resultant gelatin powders had a moisture (g/100 g, dry basis, d.b.), crude protein (g/100 g, d.b.), ash content (g/100 g, d.b.) and water activity values of 4.82, 29.54, 56.61, and 0.09, respectively. Sodium, Al, and S were the main minerals detected in the jellyfish gelatin powders, which were agglomerated and had irregular morphologies with a mean particle size of 12.8 mum. Gels prepared with 5, 6.67, and 10% (w/v) jellyfish gelatin powder had Bloom values lower than 4.2 g; melting temperatures between 15.09 and 16.12 °C and their rheological behavior was effectively characterized by the Herschel-Bulkley flow model, which revealed non-Newtonian behavior and shear thinning phenomena. Higher apparent viscosities, yield stress, and consistency index values were observed in the gels prepared at higher concentrations of jellyfish gelatin powders and at lower evaluated temperatures. This study illustrates (for the first time) the feasibility of producing novel marine gelatin powders from SDJ, which have the potential to be used as gelling, thickening and/or binding agents in several food applications.

Metataxonomic analysis of bacterial communities and mycotoxin reduction during processing of three millet varieties into ogi, a fermented cereal beverage.		Food Research International					Ogi is a fermented cereal beverage, made primarily from maize (Zea mays) and rarely from millets. Unlike maize-based ogi, little is known about the bacterial community and mycotoxin profile during the production of millet-based ogi. Therefore, the bacterial community dynamics and mycotoxin reduction during ogi processing from three millet varieties were investigated using next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, respectively. A total of 1163 amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were obtained, with ASV diversity across time intervals influenced by processing stage and millet variety. ASV distribution among samples suggested that the souring stage was more influenced by millet variety than the steeping stage, and that souring may be crucial for the quality attributes of the ogi. Furthermore, bacterial community structure during steeping and souring was significantly differentiated (PERMANOVA, P< 0.05) between varieties, with close associations observed for closely-related millet varieties. Taxonomically, Firmicutes, followed by Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Cyanobacteria and Proteobacteria phyla were relatively abundant (>1%). Lactic acid bacteria, such as Burkholderia-Caballeronia-Paraburkholderia, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus and Pediococcus, dominated most fermentation stages, suggesting their roles as key fermentative and functional bacteria in relation to mycotoxin reduction. About 52-100%, 58-100% and 100% reductions in mycotoxin (aflatoxins, beauvericin, citrinin, moniliformin, sterigmatocystin and zearalenone) concentrations were recorded after processing of white fonio, brown fonio and finger millet, respectively, into ogi. This study provides new knowledge of the dominant bacterial genera vital for the improvement of millet-based ogi through starter culture development and as well, elucidates the role of processing in reducing mycotoxins in millet ogi.

J		Chichaibelu, B. B.; Bekchanov, M.; Braun, J. von; Torero, M.							The global cost of reaching a world without hunger: investment costs and policy action opportunities.		Food Policy					This study developed a marginal abatement cost curve to identify a mix of least-cost investment options with the highest potential for hunger reduction, hunger here defined by the undernourishment concept of the Food and Agriculture Organization. Twenty-two different interventions are considered for reducing undernourishment relying on information drawn from best available evidence-based literature, including model-and large-scale intervention studies. Ending hunger by 2030 would require annual investments of about US$ 39 to 50 billion until 2030 to lift about 840 to 909 million people out of hunger, which is the 2020 estimate of hunger projection in 2030, also considering the effects of COVID-19. Investing in agricultural R & D, agricultural extension services, ICT-Agricultural information systems, small-scale irrigation expansion in Africa and female literacy improvement are low cost options that have a relatively large hunger-reduction potential. To achieve the goal of ending hunger by 2030, not only is it urgent not to lose any more time, but also to optimally phase investments. Investments that have more long-term impacts should be frontloaded in the decade in order to reap their benefits soon before 2030. A balanced approach is needed to reach the hungry soon-including those adversely affected by COVID-19 with social protection and nutrition programs.

New data on cylindrospermopsin toxicity.		Toxins					Cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is a widely spread cyanotoxin that can occur in fresh water and food. This research aims to investigate CYN toxicity by studying the effects of drinking 0.25 nM of CYN-contaminated water from a natural source, and of the direct application of moderate concentrations of CYN on different animal targets. The chosen structures and activities are rat mitochondria inner membrane permeability, mitochondrial ATP synthase (ATPase) and rat liver diamine oxidase (DAO) activities (EC 1.4.3.22.), the force of the contraction of an excised frog heart preparation with functional innervation, and the viability of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (HIEC-6). The oral exposure to CYN decreased the reverse (hydrolase) activity of rat liver ATPase whereas its short-term, in vitro application was without significant effect on this organelle, DAO activity, heart contractions, and their neuronal regulation. The application of CYN reduced HIEC-6 cells' viability dose dependently. It was concluded that CYN is moderately toxic for the human intestinal epithelial cells, where the regeneration of the epithelial layer can be suppressed by CYN. This result suggests that CYN may provoke pathological changes in the human gastrointestinal tract. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Chidambara Murthy, K. N.; Guddadarangavvanahally K. Jayaprakasha; Safe, S.; Bhimanagouda S. Patil							Citrus limonoids induce apoptosis and inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells.		Food & Function					In our recent study, we demonstrated that certain limonoids isolated from citrus seeds induced apoptosis in human pancreatic (Panc-28) cells. In this study, limonin, nomilin and limonexic acid (LNA) were investigated for understanding the possible mode of cytotoxicity in cultured pancreatic cancer (Panc-28) cells. All three limonoids inhibited Panc-28 cell proliferation, with IC50 values less than 50 muM after 72 h of incubation. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed through the cleavage of caspase-3, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and expression of apoptosis-related proteins. The Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio was increased up to 11-fold in cells pre-treated with 60 muM limonoids for 48 h. Apart from this, the limonoids also induced the expression of p21, and exhibited anti-inflammatory activity through decreasing the expression of cox-2, NF-kappaB and IL-6. Based on these results, we were interested in understanding the possible mode of inhibition by LNA, which exhibited the highest activity. The treatment of Panc-28 cells resulted in dose-and time-dependent induction of apoptosis-inducible proteins. In addition, treatment with 60 muM LNA resulted in the activation of Akt-associated signals to induce apoptosis, and the same was confirmed by the effects of the compounds on pAkt, p53, VEGF and caspase proteins. The results of this study demonstrated the cytotoxicity of limonoids to human pancreatic cancer cells through the modulation of genes involved in proliferation and survival. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

J		Chien Lye Chew; Pei San Kong; Eng-Seng Chan							Aerobic liquor washing improves the quality of crude palm oil by reducing free fatty acids and chloride contents.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					The presence of free fatty acids (FFA) and chloride contents in crude palm oil is not desirable because they have an impact on oil quality and food safety. This work presents a method to reduce these compounds by washing the crude palm oil (CPO) with treated aerobic liquor (AL). The effects of process parameters on the reduction of FFA and chloride in CPO and the resultant 3-monochloropropane-1,2 diol ester (3-MCPDE) formed after refining are investigated. The results show that the AL dosage, initial FFA content, mixing speed, and duration have significant influence on the reduction of FFA in the CPO. Meanwhile, the chloride content is reduced by approximately 50% regardless of the AL dosage used. Consequently, the 3-MCPDE content in the oil after refining is up to 53% lower than that of the refined oil produced from the untreated CPO. Furthermore, an oil recovery above 97% can be achieved after the AL-washing step. The implementation strategy of this method in the palm oil mills has also been proposed. In conclusion, an effective and sustainable method for in situ improvements of the quality and food safety of palm oil has been developed without the need for additional water or chemical. Practical Applications. Treated aerobic liquor can be used to wash the CPO in palm oil mill for in situ reductions of FFA and chloride contents in CPO to improve the oxidative stability of CPO. The lower content of chlorides in CPO could mitigate the formation of 3-MCPDE during refining, thus improving the food safety of palm oil. This method can readily be implemented by the industry and it is sustainable because it does not require the use of additional process water or chemical. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	8			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000347					FSTA:2021-11-Ne2693
J		Chien Lye Chew; Ab Karim, N. A.; Pei San Kong; Siah Ying Tang; Eng-Seng Chan							A sustainable in situ treatment method to improve the quality of crude palm oil by repurposing treated aerobic liquor.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The production of crude palm oil is a resource-intensive process because it requires a considerable amount of clean water during milling and generates a large amount of wastewater. The goal of this work was to improve the process sustainability by repurposing the treated wastewater (i.e. aerobic liquor, AL) for improving the quality of crude palm oil (CPO). The AL was first pre-treated by filtration and heating before it was used to wash the CPO under mixing. Critical quality parameters of CPO, i.e. free fatty acid, anisidine value and Deterioration of the Bleachability Index, showed improvement after washing with AL. The level of phytonutrient present in the CPO was not affected by washing. Furthermore, the amount of undesirable trace elements phosphorus, iron, copper and chlorine showed a significant reduction.

N.; Shwu Fun Kua; Chin Ming Lim							Exogenous ethylene application on postharvest oil palm fruit bunches improves crude palm oil quality.		Food Science & Nutrition					Quality and food safety are of paramount importance to the palm oil industry. In this work, we investigated the practicability of ethylene gas exogenous application on post-harvested oil palm fruit bunches to improve the crude palm oil (CPO) quality. The bunches were first exposed to ethylene gas for 24 hr to induce abscission of palm fruits from bunches. The detached fruits were then subjected to heat treatment, mechanical extraction, clarification and drying to produce CPO. Critical quality parameters of CPO produced, that is free fatty acid, deterioration of the bleachability index and triacylglycerol showed improvement with ethylene gas treatment. Contaminant content that is phosphorus, chloride, iron, and copper also showed a reduction in the CPO derived from ethylene-treated bunches. These findings corresponded with low levels of contaminants such as 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters and glycidyl esters in refined oil. The implementation strategy and practicability of this method is herein proposed and discussed. Ethylene application not only improves the CPO quality, but could potentially enhance the process sustainability of palm oil mills. © 2021 SIME DARBY PLANTATION BERHAD.

Food Chemistry					Sodium benzoate (SBA) is a widely-used additive for preventing food spoilage and deterioration and extending the shelf life. However, the concentration of SBA must be controlled under safe regulations to avoid damaging human health. Accordingly, this study proposes a microfluidic colorimetric analysis (MCA) system composing of a wax-printed paper-microchip and a self-made smart analysis equipment for the concentration detection of SBA in common foods and beverages. In the presented method, the distilled SBA sample is mixed with NaOH to obtain a nitro compound and the compound is then dripped onto the reaction area of the paper-microchip, which is embedded with two layers of reagents (namely acetophenone and acetone). The paper-microchip is heated at 120 °C for 20 min to cause a colorimetric reaction and the reaction image is then obtained through a CMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) device and transmitted to a cell-phone over a WiFi connection. Finally, use the self-developed RGB analysis software installed on the cell-phone to obtain the SBA concentration. A calibration curve is constructed using SBA samples with known concentrations ranging from 50 ppm (0.35 mM) to 5000 ppm (35 mM). It is shown that the R+ G+ B value (Y) of the reaction image and SBA concentration (X) are related via Y = -0.034 X+737.40, with a determination coefficient of R2=0.9970. By measuring the SBA concentration of 15 commercially available food and beverage products, the actual feasibility of the current MCA system can be demonstrated. The results show that the difference from the measurement results obtained using the macroscale HPLC method does not exceed 6.0%. Overall, the current system provides a reliable and low-cost technique for quantifying the SBA concentration in food and drink products.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Perinatal high-fat (HF) diet induces hypertension in adult offspring. Garlic, a naturally dietary source of Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) donor, has been shown benefits in hypertension. The article examines whether maternal garlic oil supplementation can prevent hypertension induced by HF diet and elucidate its protective effects. Methods and results. Pregnant rats are given either a normal diet or HF diet. Rat dams are given garlic oil or vehicle daily by oral gavage at 100 mg kg-1 day-1 during pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring are sacrificed at 16 weeks of age. Garlic oil supplementation during pregnancy and lactation protected against hypertension induced by HF diet in adult male offspring. The beneficial effects of garlic oil are associated with increased renal mRNA expression and activity of H2S-generating enzymes, increased NO bioavailability, increased plasma short chain fatty acid levels, and alterations of gut microbiota composition. Garlic oil supplementation increases abundance of genus Lactobacillus, but decreases genera Turicibacter and Staphylococcus. Conclusion. The data reveals associations between H2S-generating pathway in the gut and kidneys, NO system, gut microbiota, and microbiota-derived metabolites in hypertension induced by HF intake and provide insight to garlic oil as a hypertension reprogramming strategy for further translational research. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	11			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202001116					FSTA:2021-10-Te3607

Antibiotics and non-targeted metabolite residues detection as a comprehensive approach toward food safety in raw milk.		Foods					Antibiotic residues in milk are a serious health and technological problem in dairy processes. This study aims to verify the absence of administered antimicrobials after therapeutic treatments, taking into consideration the withdrawal period, and to evaluate the reliability of screening tests under field conditions after confirmatory HPLC-HRMS (High Performance Liquid Chromatography-High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry) Orbitrap analysis. Moreover, the presence of expected or non-targeted metabolites was investigated using the new Compound Discoverer approach. The presence of antimicrobial drugs was shown in 29% of the samples, and also sometimes their metabolites (for enrofloxacin and lincomycin), despite the fact that samples were collected at the seventh milking. Moreover, in 9% of the samples, undeclared treatments were revealed due to the presence of both parent drugs and metabolites. Lastly, the putative identification of two new enrofloxacin metabolites, ENRO-N-methylacetamide and ENRO-ornithine, was proposed. In the light of this evidence, it must be borne in mind that metabolites, some of which are pharmacologically active, may also pose a risk to consumers and for the entire processing of milk in the cheese industries. © 2021 by the authors.

X-ray CT and porosity mapping to determine the effect of "Fuji" apple morphological and microstructural properties on the incidence of CO2 induced internal browning.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					There is considerable variability in the distribution of porosity within a fruit, hence non-destructive methods to map porosity of the entire fruit are essential. The objective of this study was to use X-ray computed tomography (CT) to map the porosity of "Fuji" apple and help determine the extent to which different fruit morphological and microstructural properties influence the susceptibility of the fruit to CO2 stress-induced internal browning (IB). X-ray CT based porosity mapping and high-resolution X-ray CT were used to determine porosity changes in fruit tissue following exposure to an atmosphere enriched with 50% CO2 at room temperature (21 °C) for 3 d after harvest. Low-resolution X-ray CT scans enabled the construction of porosity maps for intact fruit based on a linear regression model and a juice scan which acted as a 0% porosity reference. Short-term exposure of fruit to a high level of CO2 markedly induced IB in the core region of the fruit. Axial porosity profiles measured before the CO2 stress treatment showed that porosity along the axial plane was usually lower in fruit that developed IB. Larger sized fruit were more susceptible to the CO2 stress-induced IB disorder. The porosity in the IB affected fruit tissue declined from 8.6 to 5.4% following the CO2 stress treatment. It is recommended to ensure that levels of CO2 and O2 in the controlled atmosphere (CA) storage environment are carefully controlled to minimize the risk of IB incidence.

Food Research International					Seed from industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) contains around 25% protein (mainly globulins) which is easily digested, but the low solubility of hemp globulins (HG) limits their application in many food systems. In this study, the solubility of HG was improved by blending HG with sodium caseinate (SC) and treating with a pH-cycling process. The pH-cycling involved adjusting the pH to 12 and reacting for 1 hr, followed by neutralisation to pH 7. Nanoparticles composed of HG and SC (Z-average diameter 130 nm) were formed after the pH-cycling, and the solubility of HG increased to > 80% when there was more than 1% of SC for 1% of HG. These HG|SC nanoparticles were monodisperse (PDI < 0.17) and zeta-potential was -17 mV. Hydrogen bonding is the main forces that assembles HG|SC nanoparticles because the nanoparticles dissociated by heat treatment (up to 60°C) or urea, which is an effective hydrogen bond breaker. HG|SC nanoparticles will aggregate irreversibly above 60°C, possibly due to thiol-disulphide exchange. The nanoparticles were heat-stable as the Z-average diameter was only 229 nm after heating (90°C, 30 min). N-ethylmaleimide blocked free thiol groups on HG and resulted in less disulphide-linked HG aggregation after pH- cycling, which in turn lead to smaller HG|SC nanoparticles and a bimodal particle size distribution, indicating the importance of disulphide bond for the formation of monodisperse HG|SC nanoparticles. The soluble and heat-stable HG|SC nanoparticles could be used to increase the hemp protein content in beverages and emulsions.

J		Chih-Ching Teng; Chueh Chih; Wen-Ju Yang; Chia-Hui Chien							Determinants and prevention strategies for household food waste: an exploratory study in Taiwan.		Foods					Given the large amount of food waste coming from households, reducing household food waste is essential to the mitigation of overall food waste and the provision of multi-faceted benefits for both people and the planet. This study identifies factors and management strategies for the reduction of household food waste in the Taiwanese household setting. Using snowball sampling, semi-structured interviews are conducted to collect data from 27 household food providers in Taipei. The research findings identify four critical motivators and four barriers to minimizing household food waste in Taiwan. The most frequently mentioned motivator for the reduction of food waste is a convenient shopping environment, and the most important barrier is lack of knowledge for assessing the edibility of food. Additionally, four major prevention strategies are identified to help reduce household food waste: (1) planned purchase schedule; (2) skills to keep food fresh and longer; (3) understanding family preferences and leftover management, and (4) sharing additional food and co-procurement and cooking. The results of this study not only help improve the understanding and application of Chinese household food waste reduction, but also demonstrate the significance of its socio-cultural impacts in future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chih-Chun Kuo; Hantang Qin; Yiliang Cheng; Xuepeng Jiang; Xiaolei Shi							An integrated manufacturing strategy to fabricate delivery system using gelatin/alginate hybrid hydrogels: 3D printing and freeze-drying.		Food Hydrocolloids					The extrusion-based 3D printing system was used to fabricate the bioscaffold with hybrid hydrogels of gelatin and alginate (G/A), with different total solid concentrations (3%, 5%, and 7%) and G/A ratios (1:2,1:1, and 2:1). Rheological properties were related to the 3D printability and shape retention capacity of the hybrid hydrogels. For extrusion-based 3D printing using the current platform, the materials that were considered 3D printable showed shear-thinning flow behavior. Also, the printable materials demonstrated a storage modulus (G′) higher than the loss modulus (G), with a loss factor (tan delta=G/G′) in the range of 0.48-0.58 during the frequency sweep of 15-40 rad/s, which is the corresponding frequency that can be related to our 3D printing settings. Texture profile analysis indicated that among the optimal formulas for 3D printing, the bioscaffold fabricated with the hybrid gels of 7% 1:2 G/A had the highest hardness and adhesiveness. After freeze-drying, the hardness increased significantly (p < 0.05). The 3D printed bioscaffold was also freeze-dried to extend the shelf life and enhance the mechanical properties of the fabricated structure, moisture content, and water activity reduced significantly after freeze-drying. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results demonstrated that the 3D printed scaffolds had porous structures, which has the potential to encapsulate and deliver other bioactive compounds, such as enzymes, vitamins, antioxidants, and probiotics.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The current approaches remain insufficient for measuring chicken egg spoilage or present analytical limitations. This study aimed to complement the existing analyses and identify novel markers using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry-based foodomics strategies. In the discovery set, comparative untargeted metabolomics was utilized to identify marker candidates in microbially inoculated chicken eggs. Markers were annotated by spectral matching with authentic standards, experimental libraries, or in silico fragmentation. In the validation set, targeted metabolomics was employed to verify the markers in stored chicken eggs from five farms. Statistical differences at a p-value < 0.001 revealed increases in lactic and 3-hydroxybutyric acids and decreases in phosphocholine, LPE (O-18:1), LPC (16:0), and LPC (18:0) in stored eggs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the six combined markers yielded an AUC of 0.956 and a sensitivity and specificity of ~90%. Four phospholipids were highlighted as a novel class of spoilage markers. Our findings may contribute to further industrial implementation, benefiting the quality assurance and food safety of poultry egg production.										2021	69	14	4331	4341	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01009					FSTA:2021-08-Qa0544

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A new technique, plasma activated water (PAW), was used to inactivate bacteria on the tomato surface. The PAW was generated at 60 Watts (W) for 20 min using air flow rates at 6 or 10 standard liter per min (slm) with 1 or 2 plasma jet(s). Tomatoes inoculated with Salmonella Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, or Listeria monocytogenes were treated by the PAW for 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180 or 210 s. Significantly higher reductions (p < 0.05) of bacterial populations were obtained with 2 plasma jets. More than 5 log reductions of S. Typhimurium, E. coli, and L. monocytogenes were obtained when treated with 2 acting plasma jets for 30, 180, and 210 s, respectively. When treatment time increased, lower values of pH and higher values of oxidative reduction potential, nitrite, nitrate, ozone, and peroxide were obtained. An analysis of the electron paramagnetic resonance confirmed the generation of reactive oxygen species in PAW. This study showed that PAW was effective against bacteria on tomato surfaces and offered evidences for the antibacterial mechanism of PAW.

Food Science & Nutrition					The occurrence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the liver may lead to hepatic fat accumulation. Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) has been reported to improve IR in a T2DM rodent model. We investigated the effects of ALA on NLRP3 inflammasome activation and fat accumulation in the liver of a high-fat diet (HFD) plus streptozotocin (STZ)-induced T2DM rats. The HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats were orally administered ALA (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg BW) once a day for 13 weeks. The results showed that the liver triglyceride contents of T2DM rats were 11.35 1.84%, whereas the administration of 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BW ALA significantly reduced the liver triglyceride contents of T2DM rats to 4.14 0.59%, 4.02 0.41%, and 3.01 1.07%, respectively. Moreover, 200 mg/kg BW ALA significantly decreased the hepatic levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation-related proteins NLRP3, caspase-1, and interleukin-1beta expression by 40.0%, 60.1%, and 24.5%, respectively, in T2DM rats. Furthermore, the expression levels of hepatic fat synthesis-related proteins decreased, namely a 45.4% decrease in sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, whereas the expression of hepatic lipid oxidation-related proteins increased, including a 27.5% increase in carnitine palmitoyltransferase, in T2DM rats after 200 mg/kg BW ALA treatment. We concluded that ALA treatment may suppress hepatic NLRP3 inflammasome activation, consequently alleviating NAFLD and excess hepatic lipid accumulation in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM rats. © 2021 The Authors.

Quality attributes of fufu in South-East Nigeria: guide for cassava breeders.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Fufu is a popular traditional fermented wet paste food product from cassava. We examined consumer preferences and quality attributes of fufu in Abia and Imo States of South-East Nigeria, with special attention to gender differences, for the purpose of providing guidance to breeders. Data were analysed by the use of descriptive and inferential statistics. Participants for the interview were randomly selected from a list of farmers in the study area. Individual (II) interviews were conducted among eighty participants comprising twenty-six men (32.5%) and fifty-four women (67.5%). Preferences along the food chain from raw roots to final product were also obtained. Major traits influencing gender-specific consumer preferences are related to appearance, texture and smell. Smoothness, not sticky, easy to swallow and drawability of fufu appear to be major traits that drive acceptance by both men and women. Big roots and smooth skin are prioritised for raw material. Some quality characteristics are conditioned largely by variety traits, while others can be modified by adjusting the processing methods. The complexity of producing high-quality fufu makes it imperative to introduce a multidisciplinary approach into breeding programmes.

Rheological properties of dough and bread quality characteristics as influenced by the proportion of wheat flour substitution with orange-fleshed sweet potato flour and baking conditions.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the influence of wheat flour substitution with 10-60% of peeled or unpeeled orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flour on dough rheological properties as well as the effects of the flour mixture, baking temperature (150-200 °C) and time (15-25 min) on the physical and textural properties of the composite bread. I-optimal (combined) design of the Design-Expert software was used for the experimental design whereas the flour mixture and baking conditions for wheat-OFSP composite bread formulation were optimized using the response surface methodology. Significant models were developed where lack-of-fit was insignificant (p > 0.05), coefficient of determination, R2 and adjusted R2 were greater than 0.90 for all response variables of the dough and bread. Farinograph optimum water absorption decreased whereas dough development time increased with increased OFSP flour addition. Moreover, increasing OFSP flour, baking temperature and time significantly (p < 0.05) decreased loaf volume, specific volume, crumb water activity, crust and crumb lightness, crumb springiness, cohesiveness and resilience whereas crust and crumb redness, hardness and chewiness increased. The substitution of wheat flour with 29.4 or 28.0% of peeled or unpeeled OFSP flour, respectively and baking at 180 °C for 15 min produced optimum dough and bread quality characteristics.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Avocado pear pulp (Persea americana) is indigenous to Mexico. It is widely cultivated and consumed all over the world. Its oil is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (SFAs) and can be used to replace SFAs in a diet to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Consumers seek healthy foods that aid in reducing metabolic syndrome. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the best acceptable cakes supplemented with 0%, 10%, 30%, and 50% avocado on the serum lipid profile and plasma protein in rats. Twenty-five rats separated into five groups of four test groups and one control group were fed individually for 14 days, after which blood samples were withdrawn and subjected to biochemical analysis. Intake of cake supplemented with avocado pear pulp resulted in significant (P< .05) increment in the body weight, total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL, and serum protein and decrement in LDL of the rats. The group fed 50% supplemented cake showed highest increase in HDL and least decrease in LDL. Cake supplemented with 50% avocado pear pulp proved to be a better supplementation in reducing serum LDL and increasing serum HDL and serum protein in rats, indicating to be a promising nutraceutical for the management of cardiovascular diseases and its associated complications.										2021	24	3	267	272	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.0017					FSTA:2021-08-Mq4725

Physicochemical parameters and functional properties of flours from advanced genotypes and improved cassava varieties for industrial applications.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cassava has potential for many industrial uses, which provide an opportunity for more rewarding markets. Therefore, significant research on improved varieties, targeting industrial applications, is required as a possible approach to spur improvements in the value chain. To this end, this study evaluated the physicochemical parameters and functional properties of ten (10) improved cassava genotypes for fast-tracking adaptable and preferred cassava genotypes for industrial use. The genotypes were collected from a multi-location (Uniform yield Trial) trial of the IITA breeding program in Malawi. Their flour samples were analysed for various physicochemical parameters and functional properties compared with currently marketed High Quality Cassava Flour (HQCF). Results show that genotype effect on overall quality characteristics endearing to industrial applications was significant, allowing identification of industry preferred genotypes. Starch and amylopectin content are the major determinants of variability in the cassava flours' functional properties, such as water and oil absorption capacities, solubility, and swelling power. Overall, genotypes I020452 and I010040, and the released variety Sagonja have a high starch and amylopectin content, high bulk density, and all the analysed functional properties. These genotypes showed comparable/or superior functional properties to market HQCF. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	147				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.111592					FSTA:2021-10-Jk13884
J		Chin Fu Chou; Shu Chen Hsu							Effects of extrusion parameters on the physicochemical characteristics of extruded barley ready-to-eat snacks.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Extrusion is a modern food processing to produce a wide range of food products. This study, brown rice and corn were mixed with barley at different ratios (60:0, 40:20, 20:40, 0:60) and extruded at different die temperatures (DT, 110, 120, and 130 °C) and screw speeds (SS, 200 and 300 rpm) to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics of expanded barley ready-to-eat snacks. A decrease in the water absorption index (3.35-4.73 g/g) and an increase in the radial expansion ratio (2.35-3.60) were observed at increased DT and corn ratios, but the water solubility index (7.16%-23.25%) was not affected. Increasing the SS caused increased hardness, but this decreased as the proportion of brown rice increased. Total dietary fiber content (4.21%-13.65%) was affected by a change in the proportion of brown rice, but was significantly increased with increasing DT and SS (p<.05). Practical applications: The results of this study demonstrate the optimal conditions for the production of expanded barley ready-to-eat (RTE) snacks using extrusion technology. Brown rice and corn were mixed with barley at different ratios, and extruded at different die temperatures and SSs to create expanded barley RTE snacks with favorable quality characteristics. Barley was able to replace a percentage of brown rice and corn, which provided the final product with properties such as improved texture and higher total dietary fiber content. Ultimately, the results of this study can serve as a reference for effectively enhancing the quality of expanded barley RTE snacks by extrusion processing. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15788					FSTA:2022-01-Ge0308
J		Chin Hong Geow; Mei Ching Tan; Swee Pin Yeap; Nyuk Ling Chin							Application of osmotic dehydration and ultrasound to enhance hazelnut oil extraction.		Food Analytical Methods					Hazelnut oil is a valuable product which can be used in various applications not limited to food processing, cosmetic product, and pharmaceutical industry. Traditionally, heating process is used to remove the moisture in various nuts and seeds prior to oil extraction stage in the industry which is relatively energy consuming. In this study, osmotic dehydration which is normally used as a pretreatment in fruit dehydration process was applied as a low-energy moisture removal method during the ultrasound-assisted extraction of oil from hazelnut. The effects of ultrasound amplitude, concentration of osmotic solution, and dehydration time on the yield and characteristics of hazelnut oil obtained were investigated in this study. Concentration of osmotic solution and dehydration time showed more significant effects on water removal as compared with ultrasound amplitude. Higher oil yield of 93% was achieved with the introduction of osmotic dehydration as pretreatment without negative impacts on quality of oil as compared with 88% oil yield in extraction without dehydration aid. The values for quality of oil obtained were in the range of 25-40 g/100 g oil, 0.5-1.1 g/100 g oil, and 2-6 mEq/kg for iodine, free fatty acid, and peroxide values, respectively. All the values were in the range of edible oil standard. Therefore, osmotic dehydration is a promising pretreatment method to enhance oil yield during extraction process in food industry. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	14	2	411	421	1936-9751				10.1007/s12161-020-01899-w					FSTA:2021-06-Ne1457
J		Chin Hong Geow; Mei Ching Tan; Swee Pin Yeap; Nyuk Ling Chin							Kinetic mechanism of hazelnut oil extraction with ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration pretreatment.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Nowadays, most of the researches focus on enhancing the oil yield by adjusting the various process parameters or searching for alternative techniques. There is only limited information on investigating the effects of various extraction parameters on kinetic mechanism during oil extraction. The mechanism data can provide additional information to the industry when optimization is needed. Previous work had investigated the effect of ultrasound in extraction process. The main purposes of this study are to apply osmotic dehydration as pretreatment and to investigate the effects of ultrasound amplitude, concentration of osmotic dehydration, and dehydration time on extraction mechanism of hazelnut oil. The kinetic modeling showed that So and Macdonald model was more suitable to describe the mechanism of hazelnut oil extraction with higher R2 values ranged from 0.944 to 0.987 as compared. model. The results showed that applying 30% ultrasound amplitude in dehydration stage could increase the mass transfer coefficient for diffusion step (kd) from 0.019 to 0.044 min-1 due to cavitation effect. Besides, 15% concentration of osmotic solution could limit the diffusion step with lowest kd value of 0.055 min-1 as compared with 5 and 10% concentrations due to blocking of surface by solute in higher concentration of osmotic solution. Lastly, increasing the dehydration time from 45 to 150 min could enhance the oil diffusion process with kd values increased from 0.058 to 0.075 min-1 due to lower moisture content in sample. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	14	1	187	194	1935-5130				10.1007/s11947-020-02539-1					FSTA:2021-06-Ne1400
J		Chin Hong Geow; Mei Ching Tan							Pretreatment effect of osmotic dehydration on ultrasound-assisted solvent extraction: functional properties of defatted hazelnut meal.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to investigate the impact of ultrasound and osmotic dehydration on the functional properties of defatted hazelnut meal. The results showed that osmotic dehydration sample pretreatment did not significantly affect the functional properties of defatted meal based on p-value analysis. However, the parameters in extraction process significantly affect (p<.05) the functional properties of defatted meal. The ultrasound amplitude, solvent-to-solid ratio, and extraction temperature at highest settings in the extraction process could affect the protein content (from 29 to 33%), water-holding capacity (from 1.1 to 1.7%) and emulsifiability (from 1 to 1.4%) but negatively affect the fat-binding capacity (from 74 to 72%) of defatted meal. It was found that defatted meal extracted from higher setting on parameters is suitable for foods with high juiciness and tenderness requirement while defatted meal extracted from lower setting of parameters is suitable for milk-based beverages. Practical applications. Most of the reported articles were focused on investigating the effects of processing parameters on oil yield and quality, but only limited information was given about the defatted meal after the oil extraction process. The defatted meal obtained after the extraction process can be considered as another valuable side product due to its high protein content. The meal could be very useful for various applications in food and beverage industry depends on its characteristics. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effects of osmotic pretreatment and ultrasound treatment on the functional properties of defatted hazelnut meal. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16007					FSTA:2022-04-Js4659

H.; Seng Joe Lim							Functional beverage production using acetous fermentation of soursop: physicochemical, toxicity and organoleptic properties.		Food Bioscience					Soursop (Annona muricata L.) is a highly perishable fruit and is often rejected by the market due to external injury or rapid aging process that leads to unacceptable senescence for further processing. A previous study has optimised the alcoholic fermentation of soursop to produce soursop wine using an alternative fermentative starter culture. Therefore, this study was aimed to produce soursop vinegar using an acetous fermentation and investigate the physicochemical, toxicity and organoleptic properties. Soursop vinegar showed significantly (p≤0.05) higher acetic acid (3.50.3%), total phenolic content (22020 ppm gallic acid equivalence) and FRAP (ferric reducing antioxidant power) activity (2222 muM ascorbic acid equivalence), with lower pH, sugar, ethanol and DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging activity while retaining ascorbic acid, compared to those of soursop wine. A toxicity assay carried out using the fish embryos toxicity (FET) showed that the median lethality concentration (LC50) for fish embryos was 11.8 mg/mL, which was considered as non-toxic. Meanwhile, toxicity with human liver tissue (HepG2) using the MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay suggested that the cells' survivability increased when the concentration of soursop vinegar was ≤6.25%. Sensory evaluation was carried out using quantitative descriptive analysis and the soursop vinegar was less sour and sweeter than commercial vinegar. This study offers an alternative way of reducing wastage of soursop fruit by the conversion of soursop into vinegar using a combination of alternative alcoholic and acetous fermentations.

Journal of Functional Foods					Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized by the infiltration of a number of proinflammatory cytokines into the joint microenvironment. Betulin is a natural analogue of betulinic acid, a lupane-type pentacyclic triterpene that displays many important biological activities, including anti-inflammatory activity, although the effects on inflammatory cytokine production in OA are unknown. Analyses of samples from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset and our own clinical samples revealed higher levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 beta (IL-1beta) in OA synovial tissue compared with normal healthy tissue. This was also the case in synovial tissue from normal healthy rats and rats subjected to anterior cruciate ligament transaction (ACLT)-induced OA. High-throughput screening of inflammatory cytokines in betulin-treated OA synovial fibroblasts (OASFs) identified TNF-alpha and IL-1beta as potential targets of betulin. Further analyses found that betulin suppresses TNF-alpha and IL-1beta production in OASFs by inhibiting mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling cascades. Betulin shows promise for the treatment of OA. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	86				1756-4646				10.1016/j.jff.2021.104729					FSTA:2022-01-Aj0998

Nna; Mahaneem Mohamed							Effect of bee bread on some biochemical parameters and skeletal muscle histology of high-fat diet-induced obese Sprague-Dawley rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The effect of bee bread (BB) on the biochemical parameters-body weights, calorie intake, Lee obesity indices, serum amylase, aspartate and alanine amino transferases, skeletal muscle activities of creatine kinase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, malondialdehyde, glutathione-S-transferase, total antioxidant activity, endogenous secretory receptor for advanced glycation end products (esRAGE), and muscle histology of high-fat diet (HFD) obese rats-was studied. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups: Control: received rat feed and water (1 ml/kg); HFD: received HFD and water (1 ml/kg): BB or orlistat preventive: received HFD and BB (0.5 g/kg) or HFD and orlistat (10 mg/kg; weeks 1 to 12); BB or orlistat treated: received HFD and BB (0.5 g/kg) or HFD and orlistat (10 mg/kg; weeks 6 to 12), following obesity induction. At week 12, HFD group had altered (p<.05) levels of some biochemical parameters which were modulated by BB and corroborated by muscle histology. Practical applications. Obesity is a global health problem, which prevalence has continued to be on the increase due to changes in lifestyle and dietary behavior. Additionally, the approaches that currently are being used for the treatment of this disease have not been able to successfully reverse obesity and its associated complications. The current study which showed that bee bread prevented or attenuated obesity-induced muscular pathology, places bee bread in the spotlight as a functional food that could be useful in preventing or mitigating obesity-induced muscular pathology. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13626					FSTA:2021-06-Lg0993

Printability, stability and sensory properties of protein-enriched 3D-printed lemon mousse for personalised in-between meals.		Food Hydrocolloids					3D printing of foods is an emerging technology with the potential to develop nutritious and appetising foods to accommodate needs of special consumer groups. For the technology to succeed, studies need to address the composition of printable foods and the stability of printed matrices delivering acceptable sensory properties. This study investigated the effect of gelatine (1-2% w/w), citric acid (0.9-1.5% w/w) and whey protein isolate (WPI) (8-18% w/w) concentration in lemon mousse formulations on printability, physical and sensory properties. The textural properties of the mousses before printing were highly influenced by the concentration of gelatine and WPI but less by citric acid. Gelatine had a gel firming effect, giving a higher firmness and yield stress in mousses, while WPI softened the gel structure. The gel firming effect of gelatine was beneficial to produce 3D-printed mousses with good storage stability after printing, while the addition of WPI gave better-defined layers and a glossier surface of the 3D-printed mousses. The extrusion process disrupted the foam structure, creating a more uniform air bubble distribution, but decreasing the firmness and resilience of the mousses, nevertheless, sensorial attractive and stable 3D-printed mousses were obtained. Increasing WPI concentration in mousses enhanced the shiny appearance, smooth texture and melting mouthfeel. It reduced the rough surface, lumpy and compact texture in mousses, which were associated with the gel firming effect of gelatine. This work shows that protein-enriched 3D-printed lemon mousses with good printability, stability and high consumer acceptance can be produced by formulation design.

J		Ching-Chi Hung; Bao-Ji Chen; Jiunn-Wang Liao; Yung-Ping Tai; Ching-Yi Chen							The effect of Ulva lactuca and Sargassum hemiphyllum var. chinense on arsenic metabolites and enzymes in broilers.		Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effect of seaweed supplementation (Ulva lactuca (UL) or Sargassum hemiphyllum var. chinense (SHC)) on the distribution and metabolites of As in broiler breasts. Broilers fed 5% UL or 5% SHC ingested 1.4- or 78- fold greater total As than birds fed the control diet. The majority of As species were arsenate in the SHC feed and dimethylarsinic acid in breasts from chicks fed the SHC-containing diet. Arsenate and arsenobetaine were the dominant metabolites in the UL-containing feed, and arsenobetaine was the major metabolite in breasts from chicks fed the UL-containing diet. Feeding SHC enhanced hepatic S-adenosyl-methionine and arsenic methyltransferase, whereas feeding UL elevated renal arsenic methyltransferase. Taken together, considerable variation in the profiles of As species and As metabolites existed in broilers fed seaweed. The use of SHC-containing feeds in poultry production should be approached cautiously because of the potential accumulation of inorganic As species in chicken breasts.

J		Ching-Wei Cheng; Kun-Ming Lai; Wan-Yu Liu; Cheng-Han Li; Yu-Hsun Chen; Chien-Chung Jeng							Real-time gauging of the gelling maturity of duck eggs pickled in strong alkaline solutions.		Foods					Although many ultraviolet-visible-near-infrared transmission spectroscopy techniques have been applied to chicken egg studies, such techniques are not suitable for duck eggs because duck eggshells are much thicker than chicken eggshells. In this study, a high-transmission spectrometer using an equilateral prism as a dispersive element and a flash lamp as a light source was constructed to nondestructively detect the transmission spectrum of duck eggs and monitor the pickling of eggs. The evolution of egg transmittance was highly correlated with the albumen during pickling. The transmittance exponentially decays with time during this period, and the decay rate is related to the pickling rate. The colors of the albumen and yolk remain almost unchanged in the first stage. A multiple linear regression analysis model that realizes a one-to-one association between the days of pickling and the transmission spectra was constructed to determine the pickling duration in the second stage. The coefficient of determination reached 0.88 for a single variable, wavelength, at 590 nm. This method can monitor the maturity of pickled eggs in real time and does not require the evolution of light transmittance. © 2021 by the authors.

School children cooking and eating insects as part of a teaching program - effects of cooking, insect type, tasting order and food neophobia on hedonic response.		Food Quality and Preference					Edible insects have been promoted as an alternative sustainable source of protein, however many are still unwilling to eat insects due to the perceived disgust and neophobia. In light of the growing demand for alternative protein sources, this study examined edible insects. Tactile stimuli with food have been demonstrated to be an alternative strategy to reduce children's natural neophobic reactions. The present study aims to examine the potential of tactile interactions in the form of a cooking activity to introduce edible insects to children. To this purpose, two types of insects (grasshopper and mealworm) were incorporated into a traditional Danish snack (oatmeal balls). Children (n=148) tasted and evaluated the food that was either self-prepared or other-prepared. Tasting order and type of insect had significant effects on the hedonic response. The insect oatmeal balls were rated higher in the first tasting compared to the second. The mealworm version of the oatmeal balls received higher hedonic ratings than the grasshopper version. This we propose, is caused by different degrees of "animalness" of the two insects. The cooking activity did not have a significant effect on children's hedonic response to the insect oatmeal balls.

Effect of germination on the physicochemical, nutritional, functional, thermal properties and in vitro digestibility of Bambara groundnut flours.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The physicochemical, functional, thermal properties and in vitro digestibility of flours from germinated Bambara groundnut (BGN) were monitored over 72 h. In a time dependent manner, germination led to significant (p≤0.05) increases in protein (26.1-28.79 g/100 g), dietary fiber components, digestible starch, in vitro protein digestibility (73.67-88.9%), calcium, magnesium, potassium, total phenolic content, and majority of the amino acids. Germination significantly decreased phytic acid, tannin and trypsin inhibitory activity. Protein solubility, oil and water absorption capacity, foaming capacity, emulsion stability and activity of BGN flour increased significantly with germination. Germination also modified the thermal and pasting properties of the flour. However, scanning electron microscopy did not reveal significant changes in starch granular structure. There were significant decreases in relative crystallinity (57.94-20.92%) as observed from the X-ray diffractograms. This study has demonstrated that germination significantly improved the nutritional, total phenolic content, functional and processing properties of BGN flour. This could encourage its utilization in food product development, particularly as a functional food ingredient.

Physicochemical, nutritional, and sensory properties of chips produced from germinated African yam bean (Sphenostylis stenocarpa).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					There is a growing interest in the use of low-cost and adoptable technologies in the development of nutritious healthy snacks. The physicochemical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties of germinated (24-72 h) African yam bean (AYB) flour, and the prepared chips were determined. Germination significantly increased the ash (2.86-3.52 g/100 g), protein (21.60-24.58 g/100 g), essential amino acids in adequate quantity, in vitro protein digestibility, IVPD, (73.67-88.90%). Calcium, magnesium, iron (3.04-5.70 mg/100 g), phosphorus, zinc (3.77-4.63 mg/100 g), total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activities. There was a reduction in phytic acid and trypsin inhibitor activity, by 10.31-33.59 and 13.58-36.09%, respectively, as germination progressed. The 72 h germinated AYB chips (GCS) contained higher protein (24.52 g/100 g) with adequate quantity of essential amino acids, IVPD (89.50%), minerals, TPC, antioxidant activities, and low residual antinutrients compared to the non-germinated AYB chips (NGC). The texture (hardness) of GCS (4.10 N) was significantly higher than NGC. Also, GCS had better colour and sensory attributes compared to NGC. Germination improved the physicochemical, nutritional, and antioxidant properties of AYB and the resultant chips. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The current article demonstrates a novel diagrammatic approach for the detection and quantification of polar and non-polar/ionic adulterants in milk by employing electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). For such study, some commonly used milk adulterants including melamine, starch, urea, allantoin, cyanuric acid, benzoic acid, ammonium sulphate and sodium bicarbonate are incorporated in a controlled manner in the pure milk sample. The presence of such adulterants in milk is confirmed by Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy prior to impedimetric measurements. A Pt/Teflon/SiO2/Si biosensor device is fabricated for EIS measurement where the combination of SiO2 and Teflon layer thicknesses are optimized to obtain an appropriate hydrophobicity/dielectricity for the liquid milk samples. The EIS study shows an opposite trend in the variation of electrical impedance, capacitance and conductance for the polar samples in comparison to non-polar/ionic adulterants, upon their controlled addition from 0.5 to 9 (mg/g). Such results are utilized for detection and quantification of the milk-adulterants by developing a diagrammatic approach based on impedimetric phase angle-modulus mapping. Such diagrammatic impedance spectroscopy provides a generic scheme for a rapid, cost-effective and point-of-care detection and quantification of adulterants in milk which can be further extended to other bio-consumables.

J		Chirasmita Panigrahi; Siddharth Vishwakarma; Niwas Mishra, H.; Sirshendu De							Kinetic modeling for inactivation of polyphenoloxidase and peroxidase enzymes during ozonation of sugarcane juice.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The inactivation of polyphenoloxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) enzymes in sugarcane juice by ozone treatment was modeled in this kinetic study. The juice was exposed to three ozone doses per unit volume, 0.12,0.28, and 0.45 mg min-1 ml-1 for exposure time varied in the range of 5 to 50 min. The result showed that, after 50 min of treatment, maximum PPO and POD inactivation of 83.24% and 86.03%, respectively, were achieved with ozone exposure dose of 0.45 mg min-1 ml-1. Among all attempted models, the inactivation kinetics of both the enzymes could be best modeled with Weibull model which provided adequate fitting of data with good agreement (adj R2>.96, accuracy factor ~1 and akaike increment=0). Derived Weibull model equations based on relationship of scale parameter with ozone dose were introduced to describe residual activity as a function of ozone dose in addition to exposure time. Practical applications. During long term storage, sugarcane juice is susceptible to rapid oxidation by browning enzymes. The approach of their inactivation is crucial for better storability with least deterioration in juice quality. Ozone treatment is attempted to achieve the effect through kinetic study and mathematical data modeling. The kinetic models are able to quantitate the inactivation effect by the treatment. Determination of kinetic parameters for enzyme inactivation is of paramount importance for the design and optimization of the process to achieve safe food product. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15094					FSTA:2021-05-Lc0885
J		Chirasmita Panigrahi; Niwas Mishra, H.; Sirshendu De							Modelling the inactivation kinetics of Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and total coliforms during ozone treatment of sugarcane juice.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The efficacy of ozone treatment against Leuconostoc mesenteroides (LM), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) and total coliforms (TC) was investigated. The effects of three ozone doses per unit volume (ODV), 0.12, 0.28 and 0.45 mg/min ml on microbial disinfection were studied. At the end of treatment (50 min), maximum reductions of LM (2.8 log), SC (2.18 log) and TC (3.4 log) were achieved with ODV of 0.45 mg/min ml. Various non-linear models, viz., Weibull + tail, Coroller, Geeraerd, Cerf, modified Gompertz and log-logistic were attempted to elucidate inactivation kinetics of microorganisms. The microbial tailing behaviour was well described by model parameters, like, tailing ratio, residual population and minimum cell concentration. The sensitive and resistant fractions of microbial population were characterized by the estimated scale parameter and destruction rate constants. Statistical measurements (adjR2: 0.97-0.999) and validation indices (accuracy factor: 1.02-1.27, bias factor: 0.965-1.25) indicated satisfactory performance of all models. The Akaike's theory was employed for model selection. Coroller model was identified as the most accurate model for LM and TC showing the lowest Akaike increment in 71.82% and 54.67% of the inactivation curves, respectively. Log-logistic model was selected as the best-fit model for SC owing to its reliability in describing 81.37% of their survival curves.

J		Chirug, L.; Nagar, E. E.; Okun, Z.; Shpigelman, A.							Effect of flavonoid structure and pH on iron-mediated pectin interaction.		Food Hydrocolloids					Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural compounds with suggested health-promoting properties and impact on sensory aspects. Processing, as well as mastication of plant-based food, can allow interactions between flavonoids and plant cell wall material (CWM). Pectin is a cell wall polysaccharide, present in all plant-based products, and used in a wide range of foods. Recently, a novel iron-mediated mechanism for pectin-flavonoid interactions was suggested. The current work aimed to study the impact of flavonoid structure and pH on the iron-mediated interaction by using 7 aglycones (belonging to the flavonol, flavanonol, and flavone sub-groups) differing by specific small structural moieties resulting in different binding sites. By using commercial water-soluble pectin from apple pomace and an identical (except a higher content of iron) iron enriched pectin, we have qualitatively and quantitatively presented the importance of the C2-C3 double bond for such interactions. Without such a bond the aglycones do not bind to the pectin, likely due to the loss of molecular planarity. This was studied using UV-VIS spectroscopy and membrane centrifugation. Also, the binding dissociation constants (Kd) of the flavonoids presenting a specific wavelength for the ternary complexes were determined using UV-VIS spectroscopy, showing that the lack of a hydroxyl group on C3 only slightly reduces the affinity (Kd increased from 13.4*10-6 M for quercetin to 29.2*10-6 M for luteolin), while a covalently bound disaccharide at this position practically nullifies the binding. PH 2.5 significantly reduced such binding while the difference between 4.5 and 6.5 was small and structure dependent. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Carotenoid and phenolic compound profiles of cooked pulps of orange and yellow peach palm fruits (Bactris gasipaes) from the Brazilian Amazonia.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Peach palm fruits are native from the Amazonia biome and available as different varieties with distinct colour of the fruit peel. Although peach palm fruits have been known to exhibit high bioactive compound content, the carotenoid profile of some varieties, but not all, was reported, while the phenolic compounds of all varieties remain unknown until now. In our study, the carotenoid and phenolic compound profiles were scrutinized for the first time in cooked pulps of orange and yellow peach palm fruits by HPLC-DAD-MS. The major carotenoid in pulps of both orange and yellow peach palm fruits was beta-carotene (20% and 24%, respectively), and lutein accounted for 14% in the yellow variety, which may explain the colour difference between the fruits. Both pulps of peach palm fruits presented the same phenolic compounds profile, mostly composed by di-C-glycosyl flavones, with schaftoside the major compound in yellow (45%) and orange (32%) varieties, while vicenin-2 was detected at high relative concentration (21%) in the pulp of orange peach palm fruits, in contrast to 6% found in the yellow fruits. Therefore, orange and yellow peach palm fruits exhibited a promising composition of bioactive compounds for the research and development of high-quality derived food products with claimed health benefits.

Volatile profiles of 47 monovarietal cloudy apple juices from commercial, old, red-fleshed and scab-resistant apple cultivars.		European Food Research and Technology					This study provides cultivar-specific metabolic fingerprints of volatile organic compounds in the headspace of cloudy apple juices. Cloudy juices from 47 "true to type" apple cultivars grown under identical agricultural and climatic conditions in South Tyrol, Italy, have been analysed through headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography coupled with high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-HRTOF-MS), yielding cultivar-specific volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles. Apple cultivars included 10 old cultivars with local relevance, 18 commercial cultivars, dominating the current international market, 10 scab-resistant and 9 red-fleshed ones. The 28 most abundant VOCs were found in the whole dataset, indicating a remarkable chemodiversity within juices. The main discriminant metabolites were butyl acetate; pentyl acetate; 2-methylbutyl acetate; pentan-1-ol; hexan-1-ol; n-hexanal and (E)-2-hexenal. A principal component analysis (PCA) and a hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) have not identified a clear separation of the analysed cultivar classes. Nevertheless, a series of scab-resistant and red-fleshed cultivars with VOC profiles similar to established commercial cultivars were identified; these data could help substituting current cultivars with more sustainable ones. On a more general basis, our study supports a knowledge-driven selection of apple cultivars for specific consumer preferences and helps appreciating the biodiversity of apples across old local and more recent (scab-resistant and red-fleshed) cultivars. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Soyasaponin composition complexities in soyfoods relating nutraceutical properties and undesirable taste characteristics.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soyasaponin is classified to group A saponin (gr. A) and DDMP-saponin (DDMPs) by its aglycone structure. DDMPs includes DDMP and its derivatives; group B saponin (gr. B) and group E saponin (gr. E). Gr. A is reported as a major cause of undesirable taste in soybean whilst gr. B can promote health benefits. Soyasaponin composition in various soyfoods were evaluated by Liquid Chromatography-Photodiode-Array-Mass-Mass spectrometry to reveal and clarify polymorphism of soyasaponin relating nutraceutical properties and taste characteristics. The different chemical structure of gr. A could interpret different taste characteristics. Minor soyasaponin compounds of gr. A such partially-deacetylated gr. A compositions in soyfood were newly revealed along with fully-acetylated and null-acetylated gr. A compositions. The major gr. A in raw and thermal soyfoods were fully-acetylated gr. A, averaged 125.77 and 32.1 mumol/100 g DB respectively whilst it was 22.06 mumol/100 g DB in fermented soyfoods. The ratio of fully-acetylated and de-acetylated gr. A (including partially-and null-acetylated gr. A) of raw, thermal and fermented soyfoods were 10.61, 2.28 and 0.34, respectively. DDMP was major compound in raw sample, averaged 481.3 mumol/100 g DB while gr. B was the major in thermal and fermented samples, averaged 228.4 and 532.1 mumol/100 g DB. The ratios of gr. B and DDMP were 0.1, 0.7 and 1 for raw, thermal and fermented soyfoods, respectively. The result shown process could degrade both fully-acetylated to de-acetylated gr. A and DDMP to gr. B saponins. Thus, food process could reduce undesirable and promote nutraceutical properties especially fermented soyfoods could be recommended to consume as functional foods. However, nutraceutical properties of soyasapogenol still be scant thus it should be evaluated together with the taste characteristics of partially-deacetylated gr. A.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					In this study, paneer was prepared by conventional method as well as by employing an automated pressing equipment and microstructure of paneer samples was studied by scanning electron microscopy. Further, pneumatic pressing of the hot coagulum was carried out at different pressures (2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 kgcm-2) and time durations (10, 12.5, and 15min) using a semi-automated microprocessor based pneumatic pressing unit. It was found that the microstructure of paneer comprised mainly of continuous medium of casein matrix in which micro-pores were distributed. However, differences were observed in the way the curd particles were fused during the pressing process of paneer manufacture. Paneer obtained from the automated press was found to possess more uniformity than the one prepared by conventional method. This was attributed to more uniform pressure applied by the automated technique. Further, porosity values were correlated with the openness observed in the microstructure of paneer. It was found that at an optimized pressure and time combination, paneer had a more uniform structure along with porosity than conventionally made one. The dependence of the paneer properties on the pressure and pressing time was well fitted to polynomial quadratic model which showed influence of pressure applied is greater than the time of pressing. Practical Applications. The SEM imaging of paneer prepared by automated pneumatic pressing based technique could be very useful in analyzing the microstructure which influences the texture and amount of water retention. Small to medium scale paneer manufacturers could very well utilize the automated pneumatic pressing technique to produce paneer of optimum texture and adequate amount of moisture. Paneer manufacturers of small to medium scale could very well utilize this pressing technique to increase their income at farm level. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	9			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13786					FSTA:2021-12-Pl6890

Benzalkonium chloride and heavy metal resistance profiles of Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from fish, fish products and food-producing factories in Poland.		Food Microbiology					Phenotypic and genotypic resistance to benzalkonium chloride (BC), cadmium and arsenic was tested (by susceptibility assays and molecular methods) in 287 Listeria monocytogenes strains isolated from fish and fish products, and food-producing factories in Poland. Overall, 40% of the isolates were resistant to BC, 56% to cadmium and 41% to arsenic (57% displayed resistance to more than one of the tested compounds). Among BC-resistant isolates, the most commonly detected resistance determinant was the qacH gene (83%). Three distinct types of cadA gene determining resistance to cadmium were detected, with the cadA1 variant predominant (88%), while most arsenic-resistant isolates (86%) harbored the arsA gene associated with a Tn 554-like transposon (one strain harbored two copies of arsA in different arsenic resistance cassettes). 53% of all tested isolates contained plasmids (from 4 kb to > 90 kb in size), which were classified into 11 groups (p1-p11) based on their restriction patterns. Interestingly, 12 isolates harbored the small mobilizable pLMST6-like plasmid pLIS3 encoding multidrug efflux pump EmrC. Clustering analysis of PFGE patterns revealed that these isolates represent several diverse bacterial populations, which strongly suggests mobility of the pLMST6-like plasmids among L. monocytogenes strains and their role in dissemination of BC resistance.

J		Chmit, M. S.; Horn, G.; Duebecke, A.; Beuerle, T.							Pyrrolizidine alkaloids in the food chain: is horizontal transfer of natural products of relevance?		Foods					Recent studies have raised the question whether there is a potential threat by a horizontal transfer of toxic plant constituents such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) between donor-PA-plants and acceptor non-PA-plants. This topic raised concerns about food and feed safety in the recent years. The purpose of the study described here was to investigate and evaluate horizontal transfer of PAs between donor and acceptor-plants by conducting a series of field trials using the PA-plant Lappula squarrosa as model and realistic agricultural conditions. Additionally, the effect of PA-plant residues recycling in the form of composts or press-cakes were investigated. The PA-transfer and the PA-content of soil, plants, and plant waste products was determined in form of a single sum parameter method using high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). PA-transfer from PA-donor to acceptor-plants was frequently observed at low rates during the vegetative growing phase especially in cases of close spatial proximity. However, at the time of harvest no PAs were detected in the relevant field products (grains). For all investigated agricultural scenarios, horizontal transfer of PAs is of no concern with regard to food or feed safety. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

H. d'						Value-added switchgrass extractives for reduction of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella Typhimurium populations on Formica coupons.		Food Microbiology					Recurring outbreaks linked to Escherichia coli O157:H7-contaminated lettuce and Salmonella enterica-contaminated sprouts highlight the need for improved food safety measures. The aim of this study was to determine the ability of a bio-based antimicrobial extract prepared from switchgrass, a dedicated energy crop, to reduce E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium populations on Formica coupons, a model food-contact surface. Overnight cultures of ~7 log CFU/mL E. coli O157:H7 and S. Typhimurium, air-dried on Formica coupons were treated with 0.625% NaClO, 70% ethanol, sterile water or different batches of switchgrass extractives (SE1, SE2, and SE3) for up to 30 min. E. coli O157:H7 was reduced by 4.43 log CFU/mL after 1 min by SE3, and to non-detectable levels after 1 min by all other treatments. Populations of S. Typhimurium LT2 (15-min drying) were reduced by 3.30 log CFU/mL with 70% ethanol, 5.38 log CFU/mL with SE1, and to non-detectable levels with 0.625% NaClO after 1 min, while S. Typhimurium ATCC 23564 (1-h drying) was non-detectable after 1 min by all treatments. Under soiled conditions, 10-min treatment with SE1 and 70% ethanol reduced both bacteria to non-detectable levels. Studies with concentrated switchgrass extractives combined with various other natural disinfectants or in hurdle approaches warrant further investigation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Fermented milk with Lactobacillus curvatus SMFM2016-NK alleviates periodontal and gut inflammation, and alters oral and gut microbiota.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study aimed to analyze the effect of milk fermented with Lactobacillus curvatus SMFM2016-NK on periodontal diseases and gut health in a rat model. To improve the effect of Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk administration for relieving periodontitis, the periodontitis rat models were treated with the following for 4 wk: 10% skim milk (normal), periodontitis+ 10% skim milk (negative control), periodontitis+ Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG-fermented milk (positive control), and periodontitis+ Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk (PD+LCFM). Transcriptional analysis of inflammatory cytokines [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10] was performed via quantitative reverse-transcription PCR. The changes in the oral and gut microbiomes after administering Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk were analyzed with metagenomics sequencing using DNA extracted from the oral gingival tissues and feces from the cecum of the rat models. After treatment with Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk, the relative gene expression levels of TNFA and IL1B in the gingiva decreased in the PD+LCFM group compared with those in the negative control group. In the oral microbiome, the proportion of the phylum Proteobacteria in the PD+LCFM group was lower than that in the negative control after treatment with Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk. For the effect in the gut, the relative gene expression levels of inflammatory cytokines in the colon between the normal and negative control groups were not different; however, the expression levels of TNFA and IL1B in the PD+LCFM and positive control groups, respectively, were lower than those in the negative control group. The composition and diversity of the gut microbiome differed among normal, periodontitis, and Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk treatment groups. These results indicate that Lb. Curvatus SMFM2016-NK-fermented milk could alleviate periodontal and gut inflammation and change oral and gut microbiota.

J		Chokchai Sompugdee; Vo Minh Quan; Klanarong Sriroth; Prakit Sukyai							Chemical composition of alkaline-pretreated sugarcane bagasse and its effects on the physicochemical characteristics of fat-replaced sausage.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The potential of cellulose from sugarcane bagasse used for pork sausage was investigated. The purity level of cellulose fibre from sugarcane bagasse and the functional characteristics in pork sausage were studied. The differences in the sugarcane fibre and sausage characteristics were strongly related to the cellulose/lignin content of the extracted cellulose under different amounts of bleaching. Bleached sugarcane fibres showed better water (3.55) and oil (2.34) holding capacity in comparison with untreated fibre (2.92 and 2.38, respectively). The sugarcane fibres in each treatment stage showed different effects on sausage properties. Sausages with 1% cellulose fibres added had an improved texture profile, but the addition of 3% cellulose fibres to sausages resulted in a higher cooking yield. Consumers considered the sensory characteristics of all sausages as acceptable. These results indicated that low levels of cellulose extracted from sugarcane bagasse could be added and maintain the inherent characteristics of meat products. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	11	5989	5999	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15345					FSTA:2022-03-Sr0998

Food & Function					This study investigated the behavior of nano-sized particles of hydroxyapatite (nHA) during dynamic in vitro gastrointestinal digestion, alone or dispersed within skim milk. The dissolution and the structural changes of nHA were investigated by analyzing the dissolution of calcium and using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The dissolution of nHA during gastric digestion involved a rapid early stage and a much slower later stage. It was incomplete by the end of gastric digestion, both with and without milk. However, there was no sign of nHA recrystallization in the intestinal phase. X-ray diffraction analysis of digesta showed the breakdown of the crystalline structure of nHA and the formation of potentially new calcium phosphate phases during digestion. Skim milk formed a structural clot and significantly retarded the dissolution of nHA during gastric digestion. Possible mechanisms leading to the incomplete dissolution of nHA and the matrix effect of milk are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Food Chemistry					The effect of using highly unsaturated 2-monoglycerides as oleogelators on the properties of soybean oil oleogels designed to eliminate saturated and trans fatty acids was investigated in this study. We adopted a novel two-step synthesis aiming to increase the yield of the 2-monoglycerides. The optimal synthesis conditions were a substrate weight ratio of 2:1 (w/w), 10% Lipozyme 435 (w/w total reactants), and 4 h of reaction time at room temperature. Under these conditions, the 2-monoglyceride yield (40.69%) increased by 10% compared to that of the conventional synthesis route. Additionally, soybean oil oleogels prepared using 10% 2-monoglycerides with or without rice bran wax were systematically characterized by polarized light microscopy, a texture analyzer, XRD spectroscopy, and rheometry. Comparative studies indicated that a combination of rice bran wax and 2-monoglycerides had synergistic effects on gel properties. A mixture of 4% rice bran wax and 6% 2-monoglycerides was found to provide better oleogels.

N.; Weizheng Sun							Soybean protein isolate hydrolysates-liposomes interactions under oxidation: mechanistic insights into system stability.		Food Hydrocolloids					Soybean protein isolate hydrolysates (SPIHs) prepared through proteolysis by pepsin/trypsin/alcalase and flavourzyme (termed PF, TF and AF) were added to liposomes, and SPIHs-liposomes interactions were investigated using techniques including synchronous fluorescence, circular dichroism and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The presence of SPIHs in liposomes was realized via electrostatic force, hydrophobic effect and hydrogen bonding, causing enhanced liposomal rigidity. SPIHs inhibited lipid peroxidation in a dose-dependent manner (best dose: 0.50 mg/mL; best SPIH: AF). The conformational changes of AF responding to lipid oxidation and interaction with liposomes differed slightly from TF and PF. Antioxidative and hydrophobic amino acids (Tyr and Trp) in SPIHs played important roles in stabilizing liposomal systems under oxidation (TF functioned through suppressing the increase of liposomal size). SPIHs-liposomes interactions and lipid peroxidation favored high hydrophobicity, beta-structure (beta-helices, beta-sheet and beta-turn) and disordered structure. This research extends the knowledge for developing liposome-containing food systems with high stability and nutritional value.

Food Chemistry					Effects of different levels of salt (1-2%, fwb) and kansui (0.5-1%) on the rheological, chemical and structural characteristics of noodle dough developed by repeated sheeting were studied. The rupture stress was increased by salt and kansui. The rupture elongation was increased by salt while reduced by kansui. The rupture stress and elongation increased to a maximum at 3 or 4 sheeting passes then decreased. The larger polymeric glutenin (LPP) increased while glutenin macropolymer (GMP) and free SH contents declined with the increased sheeting passes except for the dough contained 1% kansui at which these indicators remained constant. The beta-sheet was increased while the beta-turn was decreased by salt and kansui. The results showed the LPP disaggregated from GMP through physical disentanglement and experienced a reaggregation process with the SS bonds participate in, but the addition of kansui especially at 1% concentration could inhibit the disaggregation of GMP through protein cross-linking.

J		Chong Shen; Shengdong Wu; Qin Meng							Construction of portable drinking water device using an agricultural biomass-derived material of polyethylenimine-grafted-corncob.		Food Control					Corncob has been well known as a low-cost, green and reliable cellulose material but is usually discarded as an agricultural waste without utilization. In this study, the corncob was functionalized with polyethylenimine and then its potentiality for portable water purification is investigated. The portable device containing polyethylenimine-grafted-corncob (PEI-g-OC) particles is used for removing the contaminations of heavy metal ions, bacteria and organic chemicals in water. As found, the device presented high efficiency on removing heavy metal ions of Cu2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ at concentrations up to 50 mg/L and was able to kill the model bacteria of S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and E. coli at high concentrations up to 106 CFU/ml. Then, the PEI-g-OC portable device is constructed for filtering purification of the two natural water samples from local lakes, which showed a high removal ratio of >99% for heavy metal ions/bacteria and about 90% for chemical oxygen demand (COD). The portable device with 20 g PEI-g-OC is able to provide 300 B. V. (i.e. 15 L) of drinkable water for 3-5 days dairy drinking by one person. Since PEI-g-OC is degradable and does not leach any biocides, it is an environmentally sustainable option for disposable water purification devices.

J		Chong Wang; Wanglei Lin; Yanbo Wang; Linglin Fu							Suppression of hippo pathway by food allergen exacerbates intestinal epithelia instability and facilitates hypersensitivity.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Hippo signaling is a crucial pathway in innate immune responses, but the relationship between food allergy and Hippo pathway is unknown. The aim of this work is to investigate the regulation of food allergy by Hippo pathway and reveal the molecular mechanisms. Methods and results. Two food allergens tropomyosin and ovalbumin are used to challenge a mouse model and CMT93 intestinal epithelia cell model. The allergic responses and the activation of Hippo pathway are tested in these models. In the mouse model, both allergens trigged significant allergic responses, and Hippo pathway is suppressed after allergen challenge. In CMT93, both allergens upregulate the expression of allergic cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin, interleukin (IL)-25, and IL-33. In TAZ KD CMT93, the Hippo pathway is blocked, and the expression of allergenic cytokines are also suppressed. Conclusions. Both in vivo and in vitro data demonstrate that the two food allergens suppressed Hippo pathway by downregulating TAZ expression, resulting in intestinal epithelia instability, and finally leading to hypersensitivity reactions. These findings provide potential therapeutic targets and molecular markers for food allergy, and provide dietary guidelines for allergenic individuals. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	3			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202000593					FSTA:2021-06-Aj8572
J		Chong Xie; Pei Wang; Maomao Sun; Zhenxin Gu; Runqiang Yang							Nitric oxide mediates gamma-aminobutyric acid signaling to regulate phenolic compounds biosynthesis in soybean sprouts under NaCl stress.		Food Bioscience					Salt stress is an effective way to enhance the accumulation of phenolic compounds in soybean sprouts. In the present study, the effects of nitric oxide (NO) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) on the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in soybean sprouts under NaCl stress were investigated. Results showed that activities of three key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds increased by 27%-55% when the exogenous donor of NO was applied. As a result, the concentration of total phenolic compounds, phenolic acids and isoflavones in sprouts under NaCl stress increased by 26.64%, 10.91% and 19.14%, respectively. In addition, both N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and sodium tungstate treatment inhibited the synthesis of NO in soybean sprouts under NaCl stress, which lead to the decrease of phenolics content. Treatment of GABA can alleviate the inhibition of L-NAME on phenolics biosynthesis by enhancing the production of NO. On the other hand, NO treatment can also alleviate the inhibition of 3-mercaptopropionic acid, the inhibitor of GABA synthesis, on the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds. To conclude, both NO and GABA can enhance the biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in soybean sprouts and NO can mediate the promoting effect of GABA.

Fermentation of cereal, pseudo-cereal and legume materials with Propionibacterium freudenreichii and Levilactobacillus brevis for vitamin B12 fortification.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present study investigated the in situ production of vitamin B12 in eleven cereal, pseudo-cereal and legume materials by fermentation with Propionibacterium freudenreichii DSM 20271 and Levilactobacillus brevis (formerly Lactobacillus brevis) ATCC 14869. P. freudenreichii was used as the vitamin producer and L. brevis was selected to improve the consistency and microbial safety of the process. The study showed that more than 300 ng/g dw of vitamin B12 (daily requirement: 2.4 mug) were produced during fermentation in most of the studied brans and legumes. The highest vitamin B12 production was observed in the fermentation of the rice bran (ca. 742 ng/g dw), followed by the fermentation of buckwheat bran (ca. 631 ng/g dw). Furthermore, partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis suggested that the production of vitamin B12 was greatly influenced by the nutrient composition of the fermented raw materials. Meanwhile, L. brevis was found to effectively inhibit the growth of Enterobacteriaceae during fermentation. These results demonstrated that fermentation of cereal, pseudo-cereal and legume materials with P. freudenreichii and L. brevis is effective in fortifying plant-based food with vitamin B12.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT)-tannase composite was investigated as an immobilized biocatalyst on the basis of its facile preparation, low cost, and excellent aqueous dispersibility. Cross-linked tannase enzymes, obtained in the presence of glutaraldehyde, were composited with MWCNT via physical adsorption. Multiple techniques were applied to investigate, and corroborate the successful adsorption of cross-linked tannase onto the MWCNT structure. Green tea infusion extract post-treatment using the composite preparation showed elevated radical scavenging activities relative to the control. Green tea infusion extract exhibited a markedly reduced EC50 value on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals following its treatment with the enzyme composite, which represents 20%-34% enhancement in its free radical scavenging capacity. Stoichiometry and number of reduced DPPH were determined and compared. The antioxidative potential of a widely consumed, health-beneficial green tea is elevated by the treatment with MWCNT-tannase composite. Practical applications. Cross-linked tannase enzymes were composited with pristine multi-walled carbon nanotubes via simple physical adsorption. The composite presents key advantages such as low specific volume compared to other well-known immobilization media, inert, facile enzyme composition, and ease of recovery for repeated use. The work demonstrated carbon nanotube prosthetic utility in the biotransformation of food-based health commodity sought after for its nutritional benefits. The approach is of both industrial-and agricultural importance, and is a promising and viable strategy to obtain a natural, functional food supplement for the multi-billion dollar well-being and health-related industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13924					FSTA:2022-01-Hn0719

IDF and FA increased the hardness and decreased the specific volume of steamed bread, except for 0.3 g of FA. Compared to the control sample, the hardness of steamed bread with 0.3 g of FA decreased by 36%, and the specific volume increased by 10.91%. FA promoted gluten aggregation through a cross-linking reaction because the sodium dodecyl sulfate extractable protein (SDSEP) of gluten with 1.8 g of FA decreased by 61.32% compared to the control sample under non-reducing condition. The zeta-potential of gluten during the proofing and steaming stages decreased by 46.64% and 68.10% with the increase in IDF, which showed that IDF promoted gluten aggregation by reducing the electrostatic repulsion. Gluten aggregation caused by IDF and FA could be the main reason for steamed bread deterioration.

J		Chong-Chong Wang; Zhen Yang; Jun-Jie Xing; Xiao-Na Guo; Ke-Xue Zhu							Effects of insoluble dietary fiber and ferulic acid on the rheological properties of dough.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study sought to investigate the effects of insoluble dietary fiber (IDF), ferulic acid (FA), and a combination of the two (IDF + FA) on the rheological properties of dough. When the amount of IDF was increased from 2 g to 12 g, the water absorption rate of the dough increased by 14.33%. However, when FA within the dough was in the range of 61.6%-63.1%, the dough's water absorption rate was lower than that of the control sample, which might be related to FA inducing the breakdown of the dough. The dough that included IDF was associated with a higher stability time, a higher C2, and a lower development time due to the dilution effect of IDF, which weakened the gluten but increased the mechanical resistance of the dough. FA not only reduced the dough's development time and stability, but also reduced its C2 due to the crosslinking reaction with gluten. Moreover, IDF reduced the gelatinization properties of the starch and the stability of the hot-formed gel. In addition, it inhibited starch retrogradation in the dough. Due to the strong water absorption and filling effects of IDF, the elastic modulus (G′) and viscous modulus (G) of the dough increased, although the creep strain decreased. The effects of the IDF+ FA combination might be due to the crosslinking reaction of IDF-FA and IDF-FA-gluten, which reduced the plasticizing effect of the water, further increased the viscoelasticity and reduced the creep strain of the dough.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soybean oil emulsion gel is often used to replace part of fat, thereby the content of saturated fatty acids was reduced in food. This paper studied the effect of flax gum (FG) on the rheological properties, thermal properties, microstructure, and gel properties of soy protein isolate (SPI) acid-induced emulsion gels. The results showed that the apparent viscosity of SPI emulsion increased with the increase of FG addition. The mechanical properties, frequency dependence and deformation resistance of the SPI emulsion gel can be significantly improved by adding an appropriate amount of FG (0.6%). The chemical stability of the protein was significantly enhanced, the thermal stability of the emulsion gel was improved, and the water retention rate of the emulsion gel was increased by adding a certain amount of FG. The study also found that the pores between the protein network were increased and the fractal dimension of the gel system (2.862-2.775) was reduced by adding FG. When the FG concentration was 0.8%, the complexity of the gel system was minimal. In summary, FG was found to play an important role in improving the properties of Emulsion Gel, enhancing thermal stability and enhancing the strength of the gel network structure in the soy protein isolate-FG gel system.

Food Chemistry					Thinned peach is abundant in polyphenols, and has been shown to exhibit various bioactivities. In this study, we evaluated the underlying immunomodulatory activity of polyphenol extracts of thinned peach (PETP) via the NF-kappaB and Nrf2 signaling pathways in RAW264.7 macrophages. The results demonstrated that the PETP efficiently activated the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and Nrf2, as well as downstream cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma), SOD activity and ROS levels in RAW264.7 cells. Specifically, the PETP of natural drying and hot air drying exhibited less efficacy than that of freeze drying in NF-kappaB pathway. Interestingly, the PETP of hot air drying at 50 °C was more effective than freeze-dried PETP in activating Nrf2 nuclear translocation. Additionally, 50 g/mL PETP enhanced immune responses, whereas 800 g/mL PETP inhibited inflammatory development in macrophages. These findings indicated that different PETP affected the immunomodulation effects differently, which associated with the drying methods and incubation concentrations.

J		Chongting Guo; Jinfeng Bi; Xuan Li; Jian Lyu; Ye Xu; Jiaxing Hu							Investigation on the phenolic composition, related oxidation and antioxidant activity of thinned peach dried by different methods.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of five drying treatments on the polyphenol composition and antioxidant activity of thinned peach, as well as the enzymatic oxidation-related interactions of chlorogenic acid (CA), neochlorogenic acid (NCA) and catechin (CT) were studied. NCA, CA and CT were the dominant polyphenols in the thinned peach, and polyphenol oxidation was the main factor that affected the changes of polyphenol profiles in thinned peach treated by natural drying (ND) and hot air drying (HAD). Specifically, CT was more susceptible to oxidation than CA and NCA in polyphenol oxidase-catalysed oxidation. Furthermore, there was competitive inhibition between CA, NCA and CT in the polyphenol enzymatic oxidation process. In addition, the antioxidant activity of the thinned peach extracts was significantly affected by polyphenol oxidation and their concentrations, and the antioxidant activity of NCA, CA and CT were higher than that of the polyphenol derivatives formed after enzymatic oxidation. This work illustrated that freeze drying (FD) and HAD at 50 °C are suitable for making thinned peach, with retained polyphenol contents and antioxidant activity.

Food Microbiology					The study was designed to develop a sensitive one-step duplex reverse transcription droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (RT-ddPCR) to detect norovirus genogroup I and II (NoV GI and GII) in lettuce and strawberry. The specificity, sensitivity, repeatability and robustness of the assay was compared with RT-qPCR. The lowest concentration detected by RT-ddPCR for NoV GI and NoV GII were 4.68 and 8.47 copies/muL respectively, much lower than that of RT-qPCR with a number of 46.8 and 84.7 copies/muL, respectively. Lettuce and strawberry samples were artificially contaminated with NoV GI and GII suspensions, with inoculum size of 3.00 * 106 to 1.70 * 108 copies and 4.80 * 105 to 2.50 * 107 copies, respectively. Strawberry spiked with low inoculum size revealed positive results by RT-ddPCR, while recorded negative by RT-qPCR. Meanwhile, RT-ddPCR also showed a higher average recovery rate for NoV in lettuce and strawberry than RT-qPCR.The limit of detection (LoDs) of RT-ddPCR for NoVs in lettuce was 2.32 * 104 copies/25g (NoV GI) and 2.36 * 104 ciopies/25g (NoV GII), and that in strawberry was 2.56 * 104 copies/25g (NoV GI) and 2.64 * 104 ciopies/25g (NoV GII), which were 10 folds lower than that of RT-qPCR. The developed duplex RT-ddPCR assay exhibited stability and increased capacity to resist inhibitors in food samples with low concentration of NoV, making it a reliable method to avoid false negative result as opposed to RT-qPCR. In conclusion, one-step RT-ddPCR method developed in this study is pertinent in detecting foodborne virus such as NoV.

J		Chongzhen Sun; Yangwei Shan; Xin Tang; Duo Han; Xiyang Wu; Hui Wu; Marzieh Hosseininezhad							Effects of enzymatic hydrolysis on physicochemical property and antioxidant activity of mulberry (Morus atropurpurea Roxb.) leaf protein.		Food Science & Nutrition					To improve the antioxidant efficiency of mulberry leaf protein (MLP), alcalase, protamex, papain, flavourzyme, neutrase, and trypsin were used to hydrolyze MLP. The yield of soluble peptides, secondary structures, molecular weight distributions, and antioxidant activities of MLP hydrolysates (MLPHs) were investigated. Results showed that the native MLP was rich in the fraction above 6.5 kDa and was mainly composed of beta-sheets, while MLPHs were abundant in the fractions of 0.3-0.6 kDa and 0.6-6.5 kDa and were mainly composed of disordered coils and beta-folds. Limited hydrolysis of MLP could lead to better antioxidant activity than extensive hydrolysis. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the content of total sugar and total phenol in MLP increased significantly. MLP hydrolysates prepared with neutrase, alcalase, and protamex were preferable to other enzymes. Meanwhile, an enzyme to substrate level of 1% and a hydrolysis time of 2 hr were the optimum conditions to obtain higher antioxidant hydrolysates using neutrase. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Functional Foods					The molecular action underlying peptide intervention before and after colitis induction is different. To investigate the alleviated effects of mulberry leaf protein hydrolysates (MLPH) on colitis and its potential mechanism, MLPH was administered to colitis mice. Results showed that MLPH efficiently alleviated the colitis, and the preventive and therapeutic (P & T) intervention was more effective than the therapeutic intervention alone. MLPH significantly decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines, improved histological damage, and increased SCFA contents. MLPH also reversed microbiota dysbiosis. The dominant genera in MLPH intervention group were significantly positively correlated with colitis prevention parameters (p< 0.01). The DSS group was the opposite. In addition, the dominant genera of MLPH intervention group showed a co-occurrence relationship with each other. Overall, MLPH could alleviate colitis by integrated modulation of gut microbiota and inflammation response. MLPH may be a promising dietary approach for sustaining gut health to lower the risk of developing colitis.

Effect of chitosan and gum Arabic with natamycin on the aroma profile and bacterial community of Australian grown black Perigord truffles (Tuber melansoporum) during storage.		Food Microbiology					This study aimed to assess the effect of chitosan or gum Arabic edible coatings, with natamycin (200, 300, 400mg/L) on the aroma profiles of Western Australian grown truffles at five storage intervals: 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days using solid-phase microextraction (SPME)-followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The population structure of the bacterial community of both untreated and chitosan-natamycin (400mg/L) coated truffles were assessed using metagenomic sequencing analysis alongside GC-MS. The results demonstrated that all the coating treatments were able to have a positive impact in halting or delaying the changes of truffle aroma throughout the storage period, with chitosan-natamycin (400mg/L) coating having the best preservation results compared to the other coatings. Only 9 volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were found to have significant changes in chitosan-natamycin (400mg/L) coated truffles throughout the storage period compared to 11 VOCs in untreated controls. The result also demonstrated the gradual change of fresh truffle's bacteria communities over the storage period. Over 4 weeks of storage, the dominant bacterial classes of the truffles (alpha-Proteobacteria, Bacteroidia or Actinobacteria classes) were replaced by Bacteroidia, Actinobacteria, Deltaprotobacteria and gamma-Proteobacteria classes. The preliminary results from this study show that edible coatings can affect the VOC and bacterial communities of the truffles which may have implications for future research into truffle preservation techniques.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Black Perigord truffle (Tuber melanosporum) is one of the most expensive fungi in the world that appreciated by gourmets. Studies have indicated the impact of growing location and soil microorganisms on the aroma profile of truffle. The aroma profile of West Australian black Perigord truffle (Tuber melanosporum) has not been previously reported, which was studied over a 14day storage period. Sixty-four compounds were identified in all truffle samples. Significant changes (P>0.05) were observed in 11 key volatiles (carbon dioxide, acetaldehyde, 2-butanone, 3-methyl-1-butanal, toluene, 2-butenal, formic acid 2-methyl butyl ester, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 6-methyl-2-heptanol, 3-octanol and dimethyl sulfoxide) over time. Comparison of these results against published aroma profile of European grown black Perigord truffle identified number of significant similarities and differences were also detected. Dimethyl sulfoxide, a compound previously identified in European grown white truffle (Tuber magnatum), was detected. Principle component analysis (PCA) showed that the major changes in the truffle aroma profile took place in the first 7days of storage. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Foods					Black rice leaves (Oryza sativa L.) are a major part of rice straw left in open fields after rice harvest as agricultural waste. In this study, crude ethanolic extract (CEE) and various solvent fractions (hexane (Hex), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and aqueous fractions) of black rice leaves were investigated for their bioactive compound contents as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer activities. The results demonstrated that among all the fractions, the n-BuOH fraction presented the greatest contents of total phenolics and flavonoids, while anthocyanins were found to be abundant in the n-BuOH and aqueous fractions, which also exhibited powerful antioxidant abilities according to DPPH and ABTS radical-scavenging assays and a reducing power assay. Regarding anti-inflammatory activity, CEE and EtOAc reduced the production of NO and cytokine secretion (PGE2, IL-6, and IL-1beta) but displayed less effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced RAW 264.7 cells. They also significantly decreased iNOS and COX-2 protein expression. Additionally, the phenolics-rich ethyl acetate fraction showed the greatest activity against HepG2 liver carcinoma cells, inhibited cell growth, increased the Sub-G1 population, and induced apoptosis via mitochondrion-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, black rice leaves, a byproduct of rice, exhibited strong antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer capacities and might be useful for application in functional foods and the pharmaceutical industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of AOAC International					Effective sanitation of equipment is critical in an integrated food safety system. Existing sanitation verification methods have significant shortcomings that decrease their effectiveness and create an opportunity for novel approaches. This study is intended to validate abiotic bacterial surrogates (saniTracersTM) for the rapid verification of solid surface sanitation processes. AOAC validation studies included a pure analyte LOD, matrix studies, inhibition, selectivity, product consistency and stability, instrument variation, and robustness. Stainless steel coupons (4*4), pure or diluted analyte, and Chai qPCR systems were used for those studies. The saniTracers were quantified by qPCR. Average DeltaCt values for all matrixes at 50 and 250 ppm sodium hypochlorite sanitation show 3.23 and 11.95, respectively. SaniTracers behave similarly in the presence of all matrixes. SaniTracers were not inhibited at significant concentrations by any of the sanitizers used. No discrepant results were observed with the robustness study. Lot-to-lot/stability testing demonstrated no differences between the three lots of tests analyzed. SaniTracers demonstrated high repeatability and minimal interference from matrix, disinfectant, or microorganisms. The microbial selectivity study indicated a correlation between the removal of pathogens and change in Ct value for saniTracers, following the disinfection process. An average log (cfu) reduction of 4.00 was observed for the three pathogens evaluated, correlating to an average 10.65 Ct change in saniTracers, indicating a correlation in the removal of an average of 0.38 log (cfu) of pathogens per one saniTracer Ct change, following the disinfection process. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

Influence of drying processes on bioactive compounds profiles, hydroxymethylfurfural, color parameters, and antioxidant activities of Tunisian eggplant (Solanum melongena L.).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, different drying processes (hot-air convective drying, microwave drying, ultrasonically assisted convective drying, freeze-drying, and infrared drying) were applied to dry the eggplant slices. Therefore, the Newton (infrared drying), Page (hot-air convective drying, freeze-drying, and microwave drying), and modified Page (ultrasonically assisted convective drying) are the best models to describe the drying kinetics of eggplant slices. Furthermore, the effective moisture diffusivities (Deff) varied significantly from 1.16*10-10 (freeze-drying) to 3.31*10-8 m2/s (microwave drying) (p< 0.05). Besides, the highest and lowest activation energy values were observed in the samples treated with freeze-drying (38.80 kJ/mol) and ultrasonically assisted convective drying (23.87 kJ/mol), respectively. Moreover, the effect of the drying processes on the kinetic degradation and formation of bioactive compounds, HMF, enzymatic browning index, color parameters as well as on the antioxidant activity was investigated. Then, the Weibull model was proven be the best to better fit the polyphenols and flavonoids data. Novelty impact statement. Five drying processes were applied to dry Tunisian eggplant slices.

J		Choueiki, Z.; Geuens, M.; Vermeir, I.							Animals like us: leveraging the negativity bias in anthropomorphism to reduce beef consumption.		Foods					Our current work contributes to the literature of meat consumption reduction. Capitalizing on the inherent humanizing characteristic of anthropomorphism coupled with leveraging negativity bias, we created a novel approach to reduce meat-eating intention. Using on-pack product stickers, we compare an anthropomorphic message stressing the capacity to experience pain with two other anthropomorphic messages that have been used before in the literature (intelligence and pro-social behavior of animals). We find that an on-pack pain anthropomorphic sticker reduces purchase intentions of the meat product and intention to consume meat in general and is more effective than stickers displaying pro-social or intelligence messages. We also show that the pain message's negative impact on purchase intention is serially mediated by anticipatory guilt and attitude towards meat. In addition, we show that the differential effectiveness of the anthropomorphic messages can be explained by the negativity bias. That is, when the pro-social and intelligence messages were formulated in a negative way (as is pain), all three messages were equally effective at reducing intention to purchase meat and increase intention to reduce meat consumption. © 2021 by the authors.

The effect of temperature on the phenolic content and oxidative stability of o/w emulsions enriched with natural extracts from Satureja thymbra.		Food Chemistry					Sunflower oil-in-water emulsions were enriched with two Satureja thymbra extracts-obtained by ethyl acetate (EAcs) or ethanol (Es), rosmarinic acid (RA), or quercetin (Que), and the effect of storage temperature (5-40 °C) on the emulsions' phenolic content and oxidative stability was studied. HPLC analysis of the extracts indicated RA as the main component. The phenolic content of the emulsions decreased during storage, following first-order kinetics, with a temperature-dependent rate. RA was the main compound that decreased, Que followed a slower decrease and the rest flavonoids remained almost constant. The additives protected the emulsion against oxidation according to the order Es > Que > EAcs > RA. The protection factor ranged from 73 to 81% at 5 °C, but decreased to around 53% for Que and Es, 33% for EAcs, and 22% for RA at 40 °C. Emulsions enriched with extracts from S. thymbra retain their phenolic content and oxidative stability at refrigeration temperatures.

Food Chemistry					Optimal QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe) conditions with good accuracy, repeatability and precision were established to rapidly extract the European Union (EU) priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from various food matrices (Category: Poultry and Meat, Fish and seafood, Grains, Soy beans and products, Root vegetables and Coffee). The QuEChERS conditions combined with the established high performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection conditions were used to rapidly determine the PAHs in 19 popular cooked foods in Taiwan and their corresponding original materials. These conditions also meet the EU and Taiwan Food and Drug Administration specifications. Charcoal grilled, gas stove grilled and smoked foods had higher PAHs contents, while fried and electric oven-baked/baked foods had lower PAHs contents. In addition to the effects of cooking methods, the contamination of original materials by PAHs in the environment should also have an important impact on the contents of PAHs in these cooked foods.

Food Chemistry					The effects of treatment with melatonin on ripening of "Fuji" apples during storage at 1 °C for 56 d were investigated. The apples were harvested at the commercial ripening stage and treated with 1 mmol L -1 melatonin. Compared with the control, melatonin treated apples had significant reduced ethylene production (28 d-56 d) and weight loss (14 d-56 d) during storage (p < 0.05). Also, the melatonin treatment maintained better apple skin structure throughout storage. The reduced ethylene production was regulated by the decreased expressions of MdACO1, MdACS1, MdAP2.4 and MdERF109, based on RNA-Seq analysis, which was validated using qRT-PCR analysis. Moreover, the activity of 3 enzymes, including peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), were significantly increased in melatonin treated fruit (p < 0.05).

Antimicrobial combined action of Mentha pulegium, Ormenis mixta and Mentha piperita essential oils against S. aureus, E. coli and C. tropicalis: application of mixture design methodology.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Experimental design methodology (mixture design) coupled to microdilution assay were used to study the potential interactions between several active compounds from three Moroccan essential oils (EOs) (M. pulegium, O. mixta and M. piperita) against S. aureus E. coli and C. tropicalis, to increase their sensitivity and to predict optimal formulations. EOs extraction was firstly obtained by hydrodistillation, then, their chemical composition was determined by GC/MS and their antimicrobial activity was evaluated. The optimization of antimicrobial activity of essential oils mixtures by augmented simplex-centroid design allowed us to model and validate statistically as well as to establish a prediction profile of the studied phenomena. The optimization of mixtures antimicrobial activities has highlighted the synergistic effect between M. piperita and M. pulegium essential oils. The optimal mixture predicted against E. coli, S. aureus and C. tropicalis corresponded to 54%/46%; 56%/44% and 55%/45% of M. piperita and M. pulegium essential oils, respectively. This study shows that the combination of essential oils may be applicable in the fight against emerging microbial drug resistance or useful as natural food preservatives.

Brazilian consumers' attitudes towards so-called "cell-based meat".		Foods					The main goal of this online survey was to investigate the attitudes of Brazilians towards "cell-based meat", which has become the subject of great scientific and media enthusiasm. The answers of 4471 respondents concluded that 46.6% of them thought "cell-based meat" was promising and acceptable. More than 66% would be willing to try this novel product compared to 23% who expressed reluctance to do so. Nearly 40% of the total respondents did not want to eat "cell-based meat" regularly at all, whereas 29%, 43.2%, and 39.9% were willing to eat it regularly in restaurants, at home, and/or in ready-made meals, respectively. However, the majority of respondents (71%) were keen to pay much less for "cell-based meat" than conventionally produced meat (or even nothing at all), compared to 24.3% who were willing to pay the same price as conventional meat, whereas only 4.8% were willing to pay more. Approximately 51% of them considered that "cell-based meat" should not be called "meat" for marketing purposes. Job, monthly income, age, and gender were major factors impacting consumer acceptance. Meat professionals and consumers with higher incomes were less willing to eat "cell-based meat" regularly. Women (especially younger women) were the most concerned about the ethical and environmental issues related to meat production and were the most convinced that reducing meat consumption could be a good solution to the meat industry's problems. Respondents who did not accept "cell-based meat" and did not eat meat substitutes had a negative attitude to this novel food (they considered it absurd and/or disgusting) and did not believe that "cell-based meat" should be called "meat" for marketing purposes. In contrast, the people who thought that "cell-based meat" could be called "meat" perceived it in a rather positive way. These results are important for consumers of meat and meat substitutes and for companies aiming to enter the potential future Brazilian market of "cell-based meat". © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chrisfield, B. J.; Hopfer, H.; Elias, R. J.							Impact of copper-based fungicides on the antioxidant quality of ethanolic hop extracts.		Food Chemistry					Hops contain a variety of compounds possessing antioxidant capacity including phenolic and polyphenolic compounds as well as alpha- and beta- acids. These compounds may contribute to the oxidative stability of beer during brewing and storage. Hop plants may be treated with copper-based fungicides (CBFs) which have been shown to increase the total copper content of harvested hop cones; however, copper ions are well known to catalyze the generation of reactive oxygen species production in beer and may negatively impact its oxidative stability. Increased copper content in CBF-treated hops has been previously shown to have deleterious effects on the aroma quality of hops and beer. The impact of CBFs on the antioxidant content and quality of hops has not been previously investigated. In this study, ethanolic extracts of CBF-treated hops are evaluated for their metal content and antioxidant quality in order to determine whether excess copper from CBF treatment negatively impacts their antioxidant capacity.

Food Bioscience					Rice bran is rich in protein, lipid and other nutrients. The objective was to evaluate the effect of rice flour and rice bran fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in gluten free cookies formulation, as well to characterize them for their physicochemical and antioxidant properties, sensory and microbiological. The formulations were elaborated with different levels of rice bran fermented (25 g, 50 g and 100 g, or 7.08%, 14.16% and 28.33%, respectively) besides rice flour, control (without it) and other ingredients. The proximate composition, phenolic profile and antioxidant activity, sensory analysis and shelf life were determined in formulations. The use of fermented-rice bran show to be a potential substitute for wheat flour in cookie making. All formulations presented higher protein level, phenolic compounds and their antioxidant activity, and shelf life was 90 days. The cookies also presented good sensory attributes and acceptability by the consumer, highlighting the formulation of 25 g fermented-rice bran. The use of rice bran fermented by S. cerevisiae proved to be a potential alternative as an ingredient in the preparation of gluten-free cookies. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Factors influencing milk osteopontin concentration based on measurements from Danish Holstein cows.		Journal of Dairy Research					Our objective was to determine the content of the bioactive protein osteopontin (OPN) in bovine milk and identify factors influencing its concentration. OPN is expressed in many tissues and body fluids, with by far the highest concentrations in milk. OPN plays a role in immunological and developmental processes and it has been associated with several milk production traits and lactation persistency in cows. In the present study, we report the development of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for measurement of OPN in bovine milk. The method was used to determine the concentration of OPN in milk from 661 individual Danish Holstein cows. The median OPN level was determined to 21.9 mg/l with a pronounced level of individual variation ranging from 0.4 mg/l to 67.8 mg/l. Breeding for increased OPN in cow's milk is of significant interest, however, the heritability of OPN in milk was found to be relatively low, with an estimated value of 0.19 in the current dataset. The variation explained by the herd was also found to be low suggesting that OPN levels are not affected by farm management or feeding. Interestingly, the concentration of OPN was found to increase with days in milk and to decrease with parity. © The Author(s), 2021.

J		Christiaensen, L.; Rutledge, Z.; Taylor, J. E.							Viewpoint: the future of work in agri-food.		Food Policy					As countries develop, agriculture's role as domestic employer declines. But the broader agri-food system also expands, and the scope for agriculture-related job creation shifts beyond the farm. Historically, technological revolutions have shaped, and have been shaped by, these dynamics. Today, a digital revolution is taking hold. In this process of structural transformation, societies evolve from having a surplus to a shortage of domestic farm labor, typically met by foreign agricultural wage workers. Yet anti-immigration sentiments are flying high in migrant-destination countries, and agricultural trade may be similarly challenged. Robots in the fields and packing plants offer an alternative to a diminishing labor supply. COVID-19 will reinforce trends of digitization and anti-globalization (including in food trade), while slowing economic growth and structural transformation. In the world's poorest countries, particularly in Africa, labor productivity in agriculture remains at historically low levels. So, what role can the agri-food system play as a source of employment in the future? This viewpoint elaborates on these trends and reviews several policy options, including inclusive value chain development, better immigration policies, social insurance schemes, and ramp up in agricultural education and extension.

The relationship between ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering and viscosity measurements of casein micelles in skim milk concentrates.		Food Research International					Skim milk concentrates have important applications in the dairy industry, often as intermediate ingredients. Concentration of skim milk by reverse osmosis membrane filtration induces water removal, which reduces the free volume between the colloidal components, in particular the casein micelles. Thermal treatment before or after concentration impacts the morphology of casein micelles. These changes affect the flow behavior and viscosity, but the consequences for supermicellar structure have not been elucidated. In the present study, skim milk concentrates with different total solid contents from 8.7% (control) up to 22.8% (w/w), prepared by reverse osmosis membrane filtration of non-heated and pasteurized skim milk, were heat treated at 75 °C for 18 s, and compared with non-heated concentrates. The structure of the concentrates was studied using Ultra Small Angle X-ray Scattering (USAXS), and the viscosity of concentrates was measured. The USAXS intensity I (q) was fitted at small and intermediate q-regions (0.0005 < q< 0.003 A-1 and 0.0035 < q< 0.03 A-1, respectively) with a power law. The value of the power law exponent was used to assess the heat-and concentration-induced aggregation of the milk solids and correlate it with the apparent viscosity. The results showed that increased viscosity of skim milk concentrates, due to water removal and heat-load, can be explained by increased aggregation of the casein micelles into elongated aggregates and increased smoothening of the casein micelle surface.

Control of viscosity by addition of calcium chloride and glucono-delta-lactone to heat treated skim milk concentrates produced by reverse osmosis filtration.		International Dairy Journal					The viscosity of skim milk concentrates increases during storage as result of interactions between milk proteins, minerals and other solids. The present study demonstrates how these interactions can be controlled by addition of calcium or glucono-delta-lactone. Milk concentrates, produced from reverse osmosis with 28% total solids, were heat-treated at 75 or 110 °C for 18 s, followed by addition of CaCl2 (0,25 or 50 mm) and glucono-delta-lactone (0 or 80 mm), before storage at 5 °C for 20 days. Addition of CaCl2, glucono-delta-lactone or their combination were found to reduce the viscosity build-up during storage, but the extension depends on the intensity of heat-treatment and pH of the concentrates. The more pronounced effects were observed for concentrates heat-treated at 110 °C, which were also the more viscous concentrates. An increase of colloidal calcium reduce the partial specific volume of casein micelles leading to a less viscous milk matrix. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Keeping Lagocephalus sceleratus off the table: sources of variation in the quantity of TTX, TTX analogues, and risk of tetrodotoxication.		Toxins					The invasion of the tetrodotoxin (TTX)-bearing silver-cheeked toadfish and potential poisoning due to its consumption (tetrodotoxication) threatens public safety in the Mediterranean Sea. In this study, TTX and TTX analogues of Lagocephalus sceleratus (Gmelin, 1789) were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in fish collected off the island of Crete (Southern Mediterranean). We tested the synergistic effect of a suite of factors potentially affecting toxins' levels and tetrodotoxication risk using general and generalized linear models, respectively. The type of tissue, geographic origin (Cretan Sea, Libyan Sea), sex, and fish maturity stage were significant predictors of toxin concentrations. Mean TTX was higher in gonads and lower in muscles, higher in the Libyan Sea and in female fish, and lower in juvenile (virgin) fish. The concentration of TTX was also significantly and positively correlated with the concentration of several TTX analogues (4-epiTTX, 4,9-anhydroTTX, 11-deoxyTTX, 5,11/6,11-dideoxyTTX, 5,6,11-trideoxyTTX, 11-norTTX-6-ol). The analysis showed that fish originating from the Libyan Sea had significantly higher probability to cause tetrodotoxication in case of consumption. The variability explained by the models developed in this study was relatively low, indicating that toxin levels are hard to predict and the consumption of L. sceleratus should therefore be avoided. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessing the optimum level of supplementation with camelina seeds in ewes' diets to improve milk quality.		Foods					Camelina sativa seeds are rich in bioactive compounds such as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and antioxidants, thus, their supplementation in ewes' diets, may be an effective way to develop high nutritional dairy products. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of the dietary inclusion of Camelina sativa seeds in ewes' oxidative status and milk quality. Forty-eight dairy Chios ewes were divided into four homogenous groups and were fed individually. The concentrate of the control group (CON) had no inclusion of Camelina seeds, while the treatment groups (CSS6, CSS11, CSS16) were supplemented with 6%, 11%, and 16%, respectively. Including Camelina seeds in 6% and 11%, had no impact on milk performance, while in the CSS16, milk fat was significantly decreased compared to the CON. Supplementing Camelina seeds improved milk quality from a human health perspective by modifying the content of saturated fatty acid, the proportions of alpha-linolenic (C18:3 n-3), and C18:2 cis-9, trans-11 (CLA), and the omega6/omega3 ratio. Furthermore, the activity of catalase (CAT) was significantly increased in the CSS11 and CSS16, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity also significantly upsurged in the CSS16. Still, the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) were significantly increased in the CSS11 compared to the CON and CSS6, and in the CSS16 compared to the CSS6. In CSS16, protein carbonyls were significantly increased. Finally, in the CSS-fed ewes, milk oxidative stability was fortified, as suggested by the modifications in the activities of SOD, CAT, and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), in the antioxidant capacity, and the oxidative stress biomarkers. Consequently, the incorporation of 6% Camelina seeds in the concentrates of ewes improves milk's fatty acid profile and oxidative status. However, more research is required regarding the possible negative effects of the constant consumption of Camelina seeds by ewes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

IHS Markit; European Food Safety Authority				Mapping the coordination and cooperation mechanisms of risk communication on feed/food safety in the EU.		EFSA Journal					The mapping of the EU coordination and cooperation mechanisms of risk communication in the field of food safety (i.e. encompassing all matters pertaining to the feed and food chain) was conducted for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), following a mandate by the European Commission, to inform the General Plan for Risk Communication that the Commission will set out. This study focuses on communication activities in "peacetime" situations (i.e. non-crisis) on the published outputs of risk assessment and risk management. This is a specific part of the risk communication process defined in the General Food Law. Data were collected through an online survey of competent authority organisations involved in risk communication at national and regional levels in the EU-27 Member States and Norway; and interviews with selected organisations at Member State, EU and international levels. Based on these data, this report provides an overview of the current information flow of risk communication, in terms of whether and how organisations at all levels receive, produce, and disseminate risk communication material. The existing flows in each country are described and mapped in flow charts. Flows are also presented for each of the EU/international organisations involved in risk communication on food safety. A number of relevant networks are identified that actively engage in sharing/exchanges of risk communication material on food safety, including networks managed by EFSA. This project also highlighted certain challenges in current risk communication systems, and recommendations are made to address them. At national level, these are: an increase in resources dedicated to coordinating communication on EU food safety issues, to improve capacity to undertake this task; strengthen the cooperation and coordination between authorities involved in risk communication activities to ensure a more proactive approach. In addition, recommendations are provided to enhance further collaboration of communication activities at all levels (between Member States and with EFSA; between EU Agencies), so that the coordination of risk communication at EU level follows a partnership approach. © European Food Safety Authority, 2021.										2021	19	4			1831-4732				10.2903/j.efsa.2021.e190401					FSTA:2021-09-Cb2660

The effect of genotype and storage on compositional, sensorial and textural attributes of canned fruit from commercially important non-melting peach cultivars.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Peach (Prunus persica) fruit is widely consumed, both as fresh or as processed (mostly by canning) product. Despite its economic importance, a limited number of studies have dealt with quality assessment of clingstone peach cultivars after thermal processing. Thus, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the effect of canning process on compositional, sensorial and textural attributes of fruit from seven non-melting peach cultivars which exhibit on-tree ripening in succession, spanning from July till mid-September in the northern hemisphere. Descriptive quantitative analysis indicated discrete varietal differences, providing useful insights for the industry regarding the quality and marketing potential for canned products of each cultivar. Fruit packed in diluted-clarified grape juice concentrate, aiming towards a less caloric content product, demonstrated an inferior consumer perception regarding bitterness, astringency and off-taste. Storage of the canned fruit (6 versus 24 months) led to texture depletion modifications on a cultivar-dependent manner. "Ferlate" registered desirable textural properties, while "Mirel", besides the appealing orange-coloured fruit pieces, aligned with satisfactory sensorial properties, provide further marketing options for the peach canning industry. Both early ("Romea") and late-season ripening ("VLG") cultivars were proven amenable to canning with acceptable quality attributes, offering a sustainable solution towards extension of the non-melting peach harvesting season.

Multiple breeds and countries' predictions of mineral contents in milk from milk mid-infrared spectrometry.		Foods					Measuring the mineral composition of milk is of major interest in the dairy sector. This study aims to develop and validate robust multi-breed and multi-country models predicting the major minerals through milk mid-infrared spectrometry using partial least square regressions. A total of 1281 samples coming from five countries were analyzed to obtain spectra and in ICP-AES to measure the mineral reference contents. Models were built from records coming from four countries (n=1181) and validated using records from the fifth country, Austria (n=100). The importance of including local samples was tested by integrating 30 Austrian samples in the model while validating with the remaining 70 samples. The best performances were achieved using this second set of models, confirming the need to cover the spectral variability of a country before making a prediction. Validation root mean square errors were 54.56, 63.60, 7.30, 59.87, and 152.89 mg/kg for Na, Ca, Mg, P, and K, respectively. The built models were applied on the Walloon milk recording large-scale spectral database, including 3, 510, 077. The large-scale predictions on this dairy herd improvement database provide new insight regarding the minerals" variability in the population, as well as the effect of parity, stage of lactation, breeds, and seasons. © 2021 by the authors.

Rosemary extract and essential oil as drink ingredients: an evaluation of their chemical composition, genotoxicity, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties.		Foods					Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) is in high demand in the food and drink industries due to its distinct organoleptic properties. With the aim of evaluating the rosemary leaves as drink ingredients, both the essential oil and alcoholic (38%, v/v) extract were studied in terms of chemical composition, genotoxicity, antimicrobial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties. GC-MS analysis showed that the main volatile compounds in the essential oil were eucalyptol (40.1%), camphor (12.4%), and alpha-pinene (12.9%). LC-MS analysis revealed gallocatechin and rosmarinic acid as the main extract ingredients. Both the essential oil and the extract were not genotoxic (Ames test) against TA98 and TA100 at the dilutions of 5% and 90%, respectively; those dilutions were selected as the maximum possible ones in the drink industry. Their activity was investigated against Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, and Adenovirus 35. Both were effective against Adenovirus and A. niger, even the essential oil at 5% (v/v). The extract at dilutions of 25-90% had more pronounced activity against tested bacteria than the essential oil at the dilutions of 5-100%; the essential oil at the dilution of 5% inhibited S. aureus growth. The antioxidant activity was evaluated by the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging assay, the 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid decolorization assay, and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay. Both exhibited good antioxidant activity, but rosemary essential oil was far more effective than the extract. Our results demonstrate that rosemary essential oil and extract are safe and have beneficial biological properties. Therefore, they could serve as health-promoting ingredients in the drink industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Several compositional parameters (fatty acids, tocopherols, polar phenols and volatiles) in virgin olive oils from varieties located at the center of Tunisia, namely Baldi, Chemchali, Neb Jmel, Tounsi and Besbessi from Gafsa and Chemchali and Sehli cultivated in Sidi Bouzid, were studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the chemical composition of virgin olive oils (VOO) from Sidi Bouzid. Significant differences were found between varieties from Sidi Bouzid and Gafsa in monounsaturated saturated fatty acid levels, some volatile compounds and gamma-tocopherol amounts. Notably, Tounsi and Baldi VOOs showed the highest six carbon atoms alcohol contents, whereas Neb Jmel VOO revealed the highest aldehyde six carbon atoms content. Fatty acid composition, as well as tocopherol content, showed differences among different VOO. Principal component analysis and hierarchical component analysis on polar phenols, fatty acids, tocopherols and volatiles data evidenced a good discrimination among oils from the different investigated varieties. ©The Author(s) 2021.

J		Chu, H. S. S.; Boyer, R.; Williams, R.; O'Keefe, S. F.							Preliminary evaluation of inhibitory activity of medicinal mushroom extracts against pathogenic bacteria and spoilage yeasts.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A bacterial contamination in processed foods has been a continuing challenge for the food industry. Many chemical preservatives are showing signs of inefficiencies as microorganisms build resistance. Therefore, research into novel antimicrobial compounds is critical in improving food safety. The ethanolic extracts of medicinal mushrooms (MM; Agaricus blazei Murrill, Ganoderma lucidum, Grifola frondosa, Inonotus obliquus, Lentinula edodes, and Phellinus linteus) were tested for antimicrobial activities against the common foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes) and food spoilage yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Zygosaccharomyces bailii, and Zygosaccharomyces bailii /bisporus). Inhibitory activities were measured using a disk diffusion assay (DD). Additional analysis for L. monocytogenes and Z. bailii were carried out using Optical density measurements (OD). HPLC was used to fractionate MM extracts (6-8 fractions per MM). The results from DD and OD showed that most MMs displayed statistically significant inhibition compared to the ethanol control. Stronger inhibition was observed for yeasts than bacteria. Also, the antimicrobial activities were fraction dependent. Further work is required to identify the bioactive compounds.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Ginseng (the root of Panax ginseng Meyer) has been reported to have many biologic therapeutic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, and ginsenosides are considered as one of the factors responsible for these therapeutic effects. To improve their therapeutic action, probiotic bacteria are used to ferment and chemically transform ginsenosides in red ginseng (RG). In this study, we aimed to investigate the beneficial effects of RG fermented by probiotic bacteria (FRG) against ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic rhinitis in a mouse model. We induced the mouse model via OVA inhalation; experimental results revealed increased immunoglobulin E (IgE) and interleukin (IL)-4 levels, leading to Th2-type cytokine response. The mice with induced allergy were then orally administered RG and FRG over 2 weeks, as a result of which, IL-4 and IgE levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal fluid, and serum were found to be ameliorated more effectively by FRG than by RG, suggesting that FRG has better immune regulatory effects than RG. FRG also downregulated immune cell levels, such as those of eosinophils and basophils, and significantly decreased the thickness of OVA-induced respiratory epithelium compared to RG. Collectively, the results showed that FRG treatment alleviates inflammation, thereby extending a protective effect to mice with OVA-induced inflammatory allergic rhinitis.										2021	24	6	569	576	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.4854					FSTA:2022-01-Ge0315

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					This study aimed to find the best in vitro fermentation method by integrative analysis of the gut microbiota and metabolome. We selected five different media: brain heart infusion broth, Luria-Bertani broth, Mueller-Hinton broth, anaerobe basal broth, and anaerobic medium base (AMB). After in vitro fermentation, the gut microbiota and metabolites were analyzed at different culture times. The results showed that different culture media have different effects on the bacterial community structure and metabolites. The integrative analysis of gut microbiota and metabolism also proved that AMB medium is effective in keeping a stable bacterial community structure and producing less metabolites and short-chain fatty acids by simulating the nutrient-poor microenvironment in the human gut during in vitro fermentation. Thus, culturing with AMB medium for 48 h is the most suitable in vitro model for human gut microbiota fermentation, which provides an alternative approach for diet and health research.										2021	69	50	15414	15424	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04259					FSTA:2022-05-Aj7439

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					This study demonstrates the applications of Bacillus coagulans in alcohol elimination. Bacillus coagulans has recently drawn tremendous interest in the food industry and medicine considering its great environmental tolerance and beneficial effects on improving gastrointestinal diseases. However, few scientific reports connect its utilities with alcohol elimination. In this study, we introduced the unique strain B. coagulans TCI711 for such exploration. TCI711 contained alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) by mass spectrum and resisted gastric acid and bile acid. Also, taking TCI711 capsules for a week can significantly improve alcohol metabolism in humans (breath alcohol level indicated 0mg/kg in 2h after drinking 75mL of whisky). In brief, this exploratory research unveiled the potent applications of B. coagulans in alcohol elimination in humans. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	72	5	713	719	0963-7486				10.1080/09637486.2020.1858034					FSTA:2021-11-Ha10301

Foods					Red jujube fruits and bamboo shoots are rich in many nutrients and have the advantage of high yield in China. However, the storage of fresh fruits is difficult, and there are no fermented products using both as raw materials. In order to develop the two raw materials into novel products and improve their nutritional value, this study reports the production and characterization of a beverage via fermentation of red jujube fruits and bamboo shoots with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum. L. plantarum TUST-232 was selected as the starter from several different strains by comparing pH value and the number of viable cells, which reached 8.91 log CFU/mL in the beverage fermented for 14 h at 37 °C with 0.3% inoculation. After fermentation, the beverage showed improvement in the contents of several nutrients and antioxidant indices, with a decrease of 44.10% in sucrose content, along with increases of 11.09%, 12.30%, and 59.80% in total phenolic content, total antioxidant capacity, and superoxide anion scavenging ability, respectively. These results indicate that L. plantarum fermentation of red jujube fruits and bamboo shoots could be an effective way to develop a new beverage with high nutritional value, high antioxidant capacity, and high dietary fiber content. This research provided experimental support for the development of new fermentation products with the functions of improving health and body functions. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Research International					Royal jelly (RJ), a natural secretion of nurse bees, is a functional food with health-promoting properties. To investigate RJ quality changes with enhanced output and harvesting time, we compared metabolic profiles of RJ harvested at 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after larval grafting into queen cells from Italian bees (ITBs) and high RJ-producing bees (RJBs) selected from ITBs. A total of 77 high-abundance compounds were identified with reverse-phase liquid chromatography-and hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry. Metabolite abundance, water content, and antibacterial activity were found largely unchanged between both bee strains, indicating that a similar RJ quality was achieved. Notably, the observed 10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid content in RJBs (1.98%) and ITBs (2.41%) meet the standard for premium RJ in China. RJ harvested at 48 h and 72 h had similar metabolic profiles, indicating little influence of the two harvesting times on RJ quality. The harvesting at 24 h could lead to a higher RJ quality with higher abundance levels of many bioactive compounds and lower water content. Our data based mainly on RJ metabolic composition constitute evidence for mass production of high-quality RJ.

J		Chuan Qin; Yueqin Li; Yunzhen Zhang; Lianliang Liu; Zufang Wu; Peifang Weng							Insights into oat polyphenols constituent against advanced glycation end products mechanism by spectroscopy and molecular interaction.		Food Bioscience					In this study, the inhibitory effects of oat polyphenols constituent on advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation in the bovine serum albumin (BSA)-glucose and BSA-fructose models were explored. Spectroscopic techniques, SDS-PAGE and molecular docking were used to characterize the antiglycation capacity of oat polyphenols constituent. The results unveiled that apigenin and luteolin had the strongest inhibitory effect on AGEs. Spectroscopy results indicated that apigenin and luteolin inhibited the BSA glycation in a dose-dependent manner by attenuating the changes of conformational structure and microenvironment induced by glycation. Apigenin and luteolin also suppressed the cross-linking or aggregation of glycated BSA, which was reflected in the changed molecular weight and determined by SDS-PAGE. The prediction of molecular docking demonstrated that binding affinity of BSA-luteolin was greater than that of apigenin, which might be due to the additional hydroxyl group in the position of A ring of luteolin. In conclusion, luteolin had a stronger AGEs inhibitory activity than apigenin (P< 0.05). Oat polyphenols may be a good food source for inhibiting the formation of AGEs in vitro.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia in the aging population; however, no effective therapy has been established. It has been previously demonstrated that daily intake of hydroxytyrosol (HT), a polyphenol in olive oil, at a daily dietary level mildly improves cognition in AD mice. In the present study, HT acetate (HT-ac), which is a natural derivative of HT in olive oil that exhibits better bioactivity than HT improves cognition. Methods and Results. HT-ac to APP/PS1 is orally administered to transgenic mice and used Abeta-treated neuronal cultures to explore the neuroprotective effects of HT-ac in preventing AD progression. It is found that HT-ac remarkably improved the escape latency, escape distance, and the number of platform crossings of AD mice in the water maze test by ameliorating neuronal apoptosis and decreasing inflammatory cytokine levels. It is further demonstrated that HT-ac stimulated the transcription of ERbeta and enhanced neuronal viability and electrophysiological activity in primary neurons but that these beneficial effects of HT-ac are abolished upon ERbeta deficiency. Conclusions. This study suggests that as the bioactive component of olive oil, HT-ac is a promising neuroprotective nutrient that may be used to alleviate AD-related cognitive dysfunction. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	3			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202000797					FSTA:2021-06-Ne1280

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Diacylglycerol (DAG) has been drawing increased global attention due to its health benefits; however, there is a biggest challenge raised by 3-monochloropropyl esters (3-MCPDEs) and glycidyl esters (GEs) during its preparation and concentration. Herein, a model firstly was clarified and evaluated for the preparation of 48.9% DAG achieved by enzymatic glycerolysis of soybean oil in a solvent-free system though Response Surface Methodology. Subsequently, the resulted DAG was concentrated to 79.7%, involving 75.1% 1,3-diacylglycerol and 24.9% 1,2-diacylglycerol due to the steric effect and/or acyl migration, thought two-stage short path molecular distillation (SPD), and 3-MCPDEs and GEs were concomitantly evaluated during the concentration. Comparative investigation of various SPD parameters (e.g., temperature, scraping speed and feed rate), temperature was dominant and dependency in both 3-MCPDEs and GEs formation during the primary molecular distillation. However, it has a less effect on the formation of 3-MCPDEs and more effect on levels of GEs during the secondary molecular distillation process. Nonetheless, the DAG and chloride increases the probability of formation of both 3-MCPDEs and GEs. The results may promote the engineering production of DAG with high purity and quality.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) pulp oil (SPO) is enriched in natural bioactive components with high pharmacological activities. However, the presence of polysaccharides affects oil quality. Herein, the effects of different polysaccharide-adsorption treatments on the bioactive components and the in vitro antioxidant activities of SPO were investigated. The results demonstrated that the microwave-assisted activated clay (MAE-ACL) adsorption was more effective than the ultrasound-assisted activated clay adsorption for removing polysaccharides. Although the bioactive component levels and antioxidant activities of the SPO were reduced during the adsorption, the squalene content showed no significant difference. By performing principal component and correlation analyses that further evaluated the connection between the bioactive components and the free radical scavenging activities of SPO, MAE-ACL was determined to be the more suitable polysaccharide-adsorption treatment.

Journal of Food Science					At present, screening of active ingredients from natural products for pharmacological and clinical research is mostly time-consuming and costly. In this study, a molecular network (MN) guided high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet-fluorescence detector (HPLC-UV-FLD) method was carried out to profile the global antioxidant activity compounds, including the trace amount ingredients in Camellia nitidissima Chi (CNC). Firstly, HPLC-UV-FLD postcolumn derivatization system was utilized to screen the antioxidants. Then the MN of CNC was established via mass spectrometry (MS) data for getting the connection between ingredient structures. As a result, HPLC-UV-FLD indicated three antioxidant ingredients: gallic acid (126.3 mg/g), catechin (564.8 mg/g), and salicylic acid (24.3 mg/g). Combined with the MN, the actives' precise location and connection relationship were clarified based on the structural similarities. A new antioxidant ingredient, okicamelliaside, was suggested and evaluated at free radical scavenging and enzymatic protection. The novel method of activity and structural correlation analysis based on MN could provide a useful guide for screening trace active ingredients in natural products. Practical Application. Three main ingredients were screened out from Camellia nitidissima Chi by HPLC-UV-FLD postcolumn derivatization system. Integrated molecular network and HPLC-UV-FLD analysis, a new type of antioxidant okicamelliaside was selected. The novel method of activity and structural correlation analysis based on molecular network could provide a useful guide for screening trace active ingredients in natural products. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Chuanai Cao; Xin Li; Yongchao Yin; Baohua Kong; Fangda Sun; Qian Liu							Effects of sodium chloride on the physical and oxidative stability of filled hydrogel particles fabricated with phase separation behavior.		Foods					The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration (0-500 mM) on the physical and oxidative stabilities of filled hydrogel that were stabilized using heat-denatured whey protein concentrate and high methoxy pectin. Our results showed that with an increase in NaCl concentration, the particle sizes, zeta-potentials, and interfacial layer thickness of filled hydrogels significantly increased and the lightness and whiteness gradually decreased (p< 0.05). Moreover, rheological characterization revealed that the apparent viscosity and viscoelastic behavior gradually decreased at higher NaCl concentration, which was mainly ascribed to the influence of NaCl on the electrostatic repulsion between droplets, thereby adversely impacting the physical stability of filled hydrogels. Furthermore, the result of cryo-scanning electron microscopy also verified the abovementioned results. Notably, higher NaCl concentration significantly promoted the oxidation of lipids and proteins (p< 0.05), thereby decreasing the oxidative stabilities of filled hydrogels. Our results indicated that filled hydrogels prepared under different ionic strength conditions can provide the theoretical basis for their future application in emulsion-based foods. © 2021 by the authors.

Meat Science					The influence of different addition forms of kappa-carrageenan, including powder, pre-suspended in water, and pre-suspended in brine, on the textural and gel properties of frankfurters were investigated. Compared with the control group, each addition form of kappa-carrageenan led to a lower cooking loss, as well as higher emulsion stability with more trapped water within frankfurters (P< 0.05). Moreover, kappa-carrageenan powder or kappa-carrageenan water suspension addition could render higher hardness, adhesiveness, springiness, chewiness, fracturability, and resilience of frankfurters than control group (P< 0.05), which was verified by dynamic rheology analysis. However, kappa-carrageenan brine suspension addition had negative effects on the above characteristics. Microstructural images indicated that kappa-carrageenan could help form finer and denser protein matrices. However, the interaction modes between the meat protein matrix and each addition form of kappa-carrageenan were distinct. Additionally, the addition of kappa-carrageenan water suspension had the best effect on the improvement of the textural and gel properties of frankfurters with an enhanced overall acceptability.

J		Chuang, E.; Thomas, M.; Yaohua Feng							Young adult food safety knowledge gaps and perceptions of roommates' food handling practices: a survey of university students in Indiana.		Food Control					A lack of safe food handling knowledge and practices can contribute to a higher risk of foodborne illnesses from meals prepared at home. Young adults, an important consumer group, can be at an increased risk for foodborne illness due to their risky food behaviors. This study surveyed university students, as examples of young adults, to identify food safety knowledge, reveal knowledge gaps, and explore perception change resulting from living with roommates. The survey included questions about food safety knowledge, self-efficacy of safe food handling practices, and participants' perceptions of their roommates' safe food handling capabilities. A total of 2678 students completed the survey. Gender, age, previous food safety training, college major, and ethnicity have a significant impact on students' food safety knowledge. White (non-Hispanic) students had a higher knowledge score (7.68) than Asian (6.19) or Hispanic (6.57) students. Similarly, students in biology-focused majors had higher scores (7.78) than those not in biology-focused majors (7.11). Most students (65%) did not know that meat and poultry should not be washed under running water. Many students failed to practice food safety recommendations, such as using food thermometers, even if they knew it was the correct thing to do. Most students (57%) believed they did a better job of keeping the kitchen clean than their roommates (23%). As the number of roommates in the house increased, participants were 1.60 times more likely to believe that their kitchen would be in better condition if they did not have any roommates. Future food safety education programs should be developed to fill the knowledge gaps and address challenges facing young adults especially when living with roommates. Educators can create food safety materials for those who are entering university which will prepare them for ahead of time. Materials can also target current university students, those who are not in biology-focused majors, and those from a variety of ethnic backgrounds. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Global food security faces a number of challenges due to increasing population, climate change, and urbanization, while excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers has become a major challenge for sustainable, intensive agriculture. Assessing the impact of agronomic management practices on seed yield, grain quality, and soil fertility is a critical step in understanding nutrientuse efficiency. Result. The comprehensive evaluation index had good fitness to that of single attribute (i.e.seed yield, crop quality and soil fertility), indicating that the comprehensive evaluation index was reliable. Applying controlled-release urea (rice in wheat and oilseed rape field: 150kgNha-1, other crops: 120kgNha-1) plus common urea (30kgNha-1) incorporating straw from the previous season across the growing season for cereal and oilseed crops showed a slight improvement in seed productivity and Nuse efficiency among three cropping systems in the traditional evaluation method. Compared with local farm practice (applying common urea of 150kgNha-1), applying these practices in combination based on the outcome of the comprehensive evaluation index method decreased the seed yield by-1.27~29.8% but improved quality and soil fertility for the paddy-upland cropping system, respectively. Conclusion. Properly managing N application by applying partial and fully controlled release of urea with or without straw incorporation for a specific crop system has the potential to provide a better compromise among yield, grain quality, and soil fertility in southern China. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2218	2226	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10841					FSTA:2021-07-Ma3969

Journal of Food Biochemistry					The preventive and therapeutic mechanisms of CDBE on osteoporosis were studied by observing the serum bone-related biochemical indicators, bone trabecular micro-structure and intestinal flora in ovariectomized osteoporosis model mice, in order to provide a scientific theoretical basis for the further study on the effect of CDBE on osteoporosis, and the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis with clinical traditional Chinese medicines. The components in CDBE were detected by UHPLC-MS. A mouse osteoporosis model was established by the bilateral ovariectomy in female ICR mice. The biochemical indicators related to osteoporosis were detected, the right proximal tibia was scanned by Micro-CT, the intestinal microflora in the colon contents were examined, and the changes of microflora were taken as the main target to evaluate the effect of CDBE on the intestinal microflora in the model mice. A total of 16 compounds were obtained by the combined application of UHPLC-MS. CDBE could significantly increase the contents of E2, Ca2+, CT, HyP, OCN, FOXP3, P1NP and CTX-II, in the model mice. CDBE could significantly improve the trabecular micro-structure, Tb. N, Tb. Sp, SMI and Conn. D. CDBE could make the intestinal flora of osteoporosis model mice tend to healthy mice in species and quantity. CDBE can improve the symptoms of postmenopausal osteoporosis in mice, with a positive effect on the intestinal flora of postmenopausal mice. Its mechanism of regulating the symptoms of osteoporosis may be related to the regulation of bone-related biochemical indicators in the serum of mice. Practical applications.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Besides tropomyosin (TM) that is widely recognized as a major allergen in molluscs, a 99-kDa novel allergen (Rap v 2) was recently found in the sea snail Rapana venosa and identified as paramyosin (PM). However, the allergenic epitopes of PM in any molluscs have not been identified yet. In the present study, seven allergenic epitopes of Rap v 2 were identified by immunoinformatics tools, dot-blot inhibition assay, and basophil degranulation assay. Based on the analysis of PM and allergenic epitope amino acids, it was found that highly hydrophobic and positively charged amino acid residues play an important role in the formation of Rap v 2 epitopes. In addition, three potential critical amino acids that may account for TM and PM cross-reactivity in molluscs were found by sequence-and structure-based methods. These findings could be of major importance for improving the understanding of relevant paramyosin epitopes and the prevention and therapy of mollusc allergy.										2021	69	18	5381	5391	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00775					FSTA:2021-10-Re3533

Food Research International					Gut microbiota dysbiosis and oxidative stress may play important roles in the progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fermented foods contain probiotics and other bioactive components that may improve gastrointestinal health and provide other health benefits. Here, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus-fermented black barley on NAFLD rats. Adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomized into four groups: normal chow diet (NC), high-fat diet (HF), HF+ fermented black barley treatment (HB) and HF + Lactobacillus treatment (HL). The rats in the HB and HL groups were continuously administered fermented black barley or Lactobacillus, respectively, for 12 weeks (1 mL/100 g. BW, containing 1*108 CFU/mL Lactobacillus). Compared with the HF treatment, HB treatment effectively inhibited the increase in body weight, liver and abdominal fat indexes and hepatic lipids (p< 0.01), increased hepatic SOD activity (p< 0.05), decreased thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs) (p< 0.01) and improved liver function. Moreover, Lactobacillus-fermented black barley exhibited regulatory effect on high-fat diet-induced intestinal microbiota dysbiosis by increasing the relative microbiota abundance and diversity, increasing the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, decreasing the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, increasing the abundances of some intestinal probiotics (such as Akkermansia and Lactococcus), and influencing some of the fecal metabolites related to hormones and lipid metabolism. The supplementation of fermented cereal food might be a new effective and safe preventive dietary strategy against NAFLD.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present work, a simple and efficient method for distillation and simultaneous extraction of essential oils from white tea, called simultaneous nitrogen-blow distillation extraction (SNDE), was developed using nitrogen-blow extraction equipment. The effect of SNDE on compounds and characteristic of white tea extract were investigated in comparison with simultaneous distillation and extraction (SDE), and the extraction conditions of SNDE were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Volatile compounds of white teas were extracted using SNDE and SDE, and analyzed with gas-chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Quantitative descriptive analysis of white tea extract aroma showed that in SNDE, sweet, roasted and woody aroma were significantly declined compared with SDE; whereas grassy green and pekoe aroma were more similar to the sensory profile based on sensory evaluation method. Aroma metabolites analysis showed that alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, heterocyclics and alkanes exhibited significant variations. The present work demonstrated that SNDE is an effective tool for the extraction and analysis of white tea volatile, which could truly reflect the quality characteristics of sensory aroma.

In general, low temperature had a substantial effect on the grain protein and starch concentrations of wheat and the obvious effect was detected when low temperatures applied at the booting stage. The accumulation of protein and starch decreased with the decreasing temperature and low-temperature duration extension for both Yangmai16 and Xumai30. In addition, the dynamics of protein and starch accumulation under different low-temperature conditions could be described well by logistic functions. The characteristic parameters of maximum accumulation per grain (K), maximum accumulation rate (Rmax) and average accumulation rate (Rmean) in the logistic functions decreased with decreasing temperature and increasing low-temperature duration, and then the active accumulation duration (D) was shortened. Moreover, the sensitivity of the parameters to low temperatures was different. The most sensitive parameters of protein and starch accumulation were K and Rmax for both Yangmai16 and Xumai30, while the least sensitive parameter was D, which indicates that the decreases in protein and starch accumulation under low-temperature treatment were mainly attributed to the maximum protein and starch accumulation per grain and the maximum accumulation rate.

J		Chuanqi Wang; Feng Gao; Xin Guan; Xinxin Yao; Baoming Shi; Yinghua Zhang							Exposure to oxidized soybean oil induces mammary mitochondrial injury in lactating rats and alters the intestinal barrier function of progeny.		Food & Function					Similar to other food contaminants, dietary oxidized soybean oil (OSO) is also a toxic xenobiotic for animal and human nutrition. This research evaluated the effects of maternal OSO exposure during lactation on mammary mitochondrial injury and intestinal barrier of sucking progeny. Twenty-four female adult SD rats were fed a fresh soybean oil (FSO) homozygous diet (7%) or an OSO homozygous diet (7%) during lactation. On day 21 of lactation, upregulated mRNA expression of Sirt3 and PRDX3 and downregulated mRNA expression of Mfn2 were observed in mammary tissues in the OSO group compared to the control group (P< 0.05). Maternal OSO consumption increased the FasL transcriptional level in the mammary glands of rat dams (P< 0.05), while the mRNA expression of Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase3, and Fas was not different from that in the control group (P> 0.05). OSO enhanced the Nrf2 transcriptional level and decreased the expression of Keap1 and PPARalpha in mammary tissues (P< 0.05). In addition, the contents of CAT, MDA, SOD were not affected by dietary OSO (P> 0.05), while the concentration of H2O2 was significantly decreased in the OSO-treated mammary glands of rat dams (P< 0.05). Maternal OSO exposure during lactation did not affect the organ coefficients of pups (P> 0.05). However, maternal OSO consumption influenced the intestinal tight junction protein expression of progeny (P< 0.05). In summary, the present study demonstrated that dietary OSO may aggravate mammary injury and mitochondria dysfunction, but the OSO-induced damage was self-alleviating via the promotion of Sirt3 and PRDX3 expression and further scavenging of oxidative products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	8	3705	3719	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00423a					FSTA:2021-09-Ne2156
J		Chuanqi Wang; Yang Liu; Huiting Wang; Feng Gao; Xin Guan; Baoming Shi							Maternal exposure to oxidized soybean oil impairs placental development by modulating nutrient transporters in a rat model.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Introduction. As an exogenous food contaminant, dietary oxidized lipid impairs growth and development, and triggers chronic diseases in humans or animals. This study explores the effects of soybean oil with different oxidative degree on the placental injury of gestational rats. Methods and Results. Thirty-two female adult rats are randomly assigned to four groups. The control group is fed the purified diet with fresh soybean oil (FSO), and the treatment groups are fed purified diets with lipid content replaced by oxidized soybean oil (OSO) at 200, 400, and 800 mEqO2 kg-1 from conception until delivery. On day 20 of gestation, OSO decreased placental and embryonic weights as the oxidative degree increased linearly and quadratically. The expression of Bax showed a linear increase, and Bcl-2 decreased as the oxidative degree increased. The expression of Fosl1 and Esx1 is linearly and quadratically decreased in OSO-treated groups than FSO group. OSO decreased the level of IL-10 but increased expression of IL-1beta in placenta and plasma. OSO remarkably upregulates levels of Fatp1 and Glut1 and decreases expression of Snat2 and Glut3. Conclusion. OSO aggravates placental injury by modulating nutrient transporters and apoptosis-related genes, impedes placental growth and development, and ultimately leads to the decrease of fetal weight. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	18			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100301					FSTA:2022-01-Ne0147
J		Chuanqi Xie; Won Suk Lee							Detection of citrus black spot symptoms using spectral reflectance.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Citrus black spot (CBS) disease can usually result in fruit blemish and yield loss on all citrus. Spectral reflectance was utilized to detect CBS symptoms in this study. Hyperspectral images of both healthy and diseased citrus were collected in the spectral region of 396-1010 nm. After raw image calibration, spectral reflectance of diseased (early hard spot, advanced hard spot, cracked spot, early virulent, and virulent) and healthy samples were extracted and used as independent variables for classification. Effective wavelengths were selected using regression coefficients based on partial least squares analysis. K-nearest neighbor models were established to classify the symptoms in each group (early hard spot vs. advanced hard spot, early virulent vs. virulent, hard spot vs. cracked spot, hard spot vs. virulent, cracked spot vs. virulent, diseased vs. healthy, and early stage vs. advanced stage). In diseased vs. healthy group, the models yielded the correct classification accuracies of 99.4% (using full wavelengths) and 100.0% (using selected wavelengths) for diseased samples. The correct classification accuracies were 92.5% (using full wavelengths) and 93.8% (using selected wavelengths) for early stage samples (early disease). Besides, the selected wavelengths were 549, 668, 706, and 790 nm for diseased vs. healthy group, and 675, 711, and 835 nm for early stage vs. advanced stage group. The overall results demonstrated that spectral reflectance information has the potential to classify different symptoms of CBS.

J		Chuanqi Yu; Fan Lin; Haoji Guo; Guoquan Liu; Xianda He; Xiaobo Wen							Dietary fucoidan extracted from macroalgae Saccharina japonica alleviate the hepatic lipid accumulation of black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii).		Food & Function					The use of an artificial diet often leads to the increase of risk factors for the development of liver diseases, such as hepatic lipid accumulation (HLA) in commercially cultured fish species. Our previous study showed that dietary Saccharina japonica could effectively alleviate HLA in black seabream (Acanthopagrus schlegelii), which may be linked predominantly to S. japonica fucoidan. Thus, a 56d nutritional trial was designed to investigate the effects of dietary fucoidan (CTRL, 0 g kg-1; ASJ1, 0.75 g kg-1; ASJ2, 3.00 g kg-1) on growth performance, fillets nutritional values, and HLA of black seabream. Results showed that dietary fucoidan significantly improved the growth and the contents of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3PUFA) in fillets of black seabream. Moreover, dietary fucoidan improved HLA-related parameters, including reducing serum and liver lipid contents and the activity of aminotransferase. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed that dietary fucoidan reduced the area of hepatic lipid droplets in black seabream (P< 0.05). In addition, the transcriptomic analysis of differentially expressed gene (DEG) showed that all DEG in fatty acid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis were down-regulated, and all DEG in the regulation of autophagy were up-regulated in the ASJ1 group compared with CTRL group. Moreover, the metabolomic analysis of differentially expressed metabolite (DEM) found that lipid metabolism was the main type of KEGG pathway altered by fucoidan supplementation. Furthermore, the combined transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis found that dietary fucoidan mainly modified the lipid metabolic pathway of primary bile acid biosynthesis, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and arachidonic acid metabolism in the liver. In general, dietary fucoidan effectively alleviated HLA of black seabream, and the underlying mechanism may be ascribed to promoting the autophagy and inhibiting the synthesis of lipids and bile acids. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	24	12724	12733	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03490a					FSTA:2022-04-Rc1328
J		Chuanqin Hu; Ren Li; Jiahui Wang; Yingli Liu; Jing Wang; Baoguo Sun							Untargeted metabolite profiling of liver in mice exposed to 2-methylfuran.		Journal of Food Science					Furan, a significant food contaminant, was found in many cooked foods. In most cooked foods, furan has been found to be coexisted with some alkylated derivatives such as 2-methylfuran. 2-methylfuran was found to be potent hepatotoxins. Little toxicological data is available for 2-methylfuran. The objective of this study was to investigate metabolite changes in the liver samples from mice fed with 2-methylfuran by untargeted metabolomic approach. Metabolomic analysis was conducted by using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-four metabolites were identified as differential metabolites. The important metabolic pathway was linoleic acid metabolism, glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism, methane metabolism, ascorbate, and aldarate metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, cysteine, and methionine metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, and pyruvate metabolism. These newly identified pathways provide evidence for investigating toxic mechanism of 2-methylfuran. Practical Application. Furan in foods has caused public health concern for its hepatotoxicity and hepatic carcinogenicity in rodents. The metabolomics method was constructed to find more biomarkers to study underlying hepatotoxic mechanisms of 2-methylfuran. It will offer important information for official limits of 2-methylfuran in foods. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	1	242	250	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15549					FSTA:2021-05-Cf1449
J		Chuantao Peng; Zhihong Sun; Yaru Sun; Teng Ma; Weicheng Li; Heping Zhang							Characterization and association of bacterial communities and nonvolatile components in spontaneously fermented cow milk at different geographical distances.		Journal of Dairy Science					In the ecosystem of spontaneously fermented cow milk, the characteristics and relationship of bacterial communities and nonvolatile components at different scales of geographical distances (provincial, county, and village levels) are unclear. Here, 25 sampling sites from Xin Jiang and Tibet, 2 provinces of China, were selected based on the distribution of spontaneously fermented cow milk and used for metagenomic and metabolomic analysis. At the provincial geographical distance, the same predominant species, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus, were detected in Xin Jiang and Tibet. Further, the richness of the bacterial composition of samples from Tibet was higher than those from Xin Jiang; specifically, at the species level, 28 species were identified in Tibet samples but only 7 species in Xin Jiang samples. At the provincial geographical level, we detected significant differences in bacterial structure, shown in principal coordinate analysis plots, and significant differences (Simpson index) in bacterial diversity were also detected. However, at the county and village levels, no significant differences were detected in bacterial communities and diversity, but a difference in bacterial compositions was detectable. This indicates that bacterial communities and diversity of spontaneously fermented milk dissimilarity significantly increased with geographic distance. For the nonvolatile component profiles, the partial least squares discriminant analysis plot (R2Y > 0.5 and Q2> 0.5 for the goodness-of-fit and predictive ability parameter, respectively) showed that samples from different geographical distances (provincial, county, and village) were all separated, which indicated that all the discriminations in nonvolatile components profiles were from different geographical distances. Investigating relationships between lactic acid bacteria and discriminatory nonvolatile components at the county level showed that 9 species were positively correlated with 16 discriminatory nonvolatile components, all species with low abundance rather than the predominant species L. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus and Strep. thermophilus, which indicates the importance of the selection of autochthonous nonpredominant bacteria.

Journal of Food Science					Additional moisture in preparing red koji, Monascus-fermented rice, is a characteristic production process. To determine how additional moisture affects red koji preparation as per quality, we compared the growth of Monascus purpureus, enzyme and pigment production, and related gene expressions using our findings. We considered two kinds of red koji: one prepared with additional moisture at the middle part of the preparation and the other prepared without additional moisture. Our results showed that additional moisture did not promote the growth of M. purpureus, but it was significantly increased the pigment (red and yellow) and tended to increase the alpha-amylase level and saccharification power. Although adding a high amount of moisture (approximately 60% moisture content) promoted pigment production, it slightly repressed enzyme production. In contrast, adding approximately 50% moisture content promoted enzyme production. These findings showed that the additional moisture can affect the quality of red koji on the purpose. The expression of 10 pigment biosynthetic gene clusters and two glycohydrolase genes in red koji after adding moisture was analyzed through real-time qPCR. Eight genes were upregulated within 1 hr after adding water, with mppR2 being the first upregulated gene within 30 min. The expression of genes as per pigment production quickly responded to additional moisture during solid-state fermentation. Moreover, acetyl-CoA, which is a starting substrate for pigment content in red koji was increased within 3 hr after adding water. This study first described the relationship between additional moisture and expression of pigment biosynthetic genes by Monascus spp. during red koji preparation. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	3	969	976	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15610					FSTA:2021-07-Ge3549
J		Chuanwu Han; Meng Ma; Tianbao Yang; Man Li; Qingjie Sun							Heat mediated physicochemical and structural changes of wheat gluten in the presence of salt and alkali.		Food Hydrocolloids					To understand the heat mediated cross-linking mechanism of gluten in the presence of salt and alkali, the effects of heating on the physicochemical and structural changes of gluten protein was comparatively investigated in this study. Our results showed that the G′ value of gluten was mediated by heating, while alkali delayed the transition temperature by approximately 20 °C. Salt increased the extensibility of gluten. However, alkali improved gluten strength and toughness. Fluorescence spectroscopy, surface hydrophobicity, and AFM images demonstrated that hydrophobic interactions and aggregations of protein molecular chains were enhanced by both salt and alkali, and heating further promoted these interactions. In addition, alkali reduced the aggregation temperature of large glutenin polymers from 95 to 75 °C according to SE-HPLC profiles. RP-HPLC patterns confirmed that alpha- and gamma-gliadin subunits were more susceptible to heat and polymerized after heating at 95 °C with alkali. QCM-D results showed that alkali promoted protein-protein interactions in gluten, which was positively correlated with temperature. This study consummates the understanding of heating mediated cross-linking mechanisms of gluten with salt and alkali and provides a more comprehensive theoretical basis for the control of gluten properties and quality of wheat products.

Food Chemistry					Brazilin (Bra), hematoxylin (Hto) and hematein (Hte) are structurally similar polyphenols having rich biological activities, but their antioxidant ability has not been well studied. Here, their protective ability against human serum albumin (HSA) oxidative degradation were investigated using 2,2′-Azobis (2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride (AAPH), NaClO and Fenton like reactions methods. The results indicated that polyphenols inhibited the oxidative injuries of HSA in the order: Hto > Bra > Hte. Additionally, the biological effects of polyphenols were mostly influenced by their binding to protein. Therefore, the structure-affinity relationships of polyphenols binding to HSA were also explored. Fluorescence experiments indicated that polyphenols bound to HSA through static quenching mechanism. Furthermore, some conformational changes of HSA could be observed in the presence of polyphenols. Altogether, molecular structure of polyphenols played a significant role in their protective effect against HSA oxidative damage and binding ability, which provided fundamental insights into their application as health care foods.

Food Chemistry					A facile in-tube solid phase microextraction (in-tube SPME) procedure was developed to enrich ractopamine before HPLC-UV analysis. This was achieved by employing amide groups modified polysaccharide-silica hybrid monolith as an efficient sorbent. The monolith was synthesized by a simple reaction with agarose oxide and tetramethoxylisane, followed by the modification of amide groups via subsequent ring opening, "thiol-ene" click and dehydration reactions. Under the optimized extraction conditions, the enrichment factors for ractopamine, dopamine, clenbuterol, para-methylphenol and phenol were determined to be 50.5, 32.2, 4.8, 2.1 and 1.8, respectively. The monolithic column has ideal selectivity for ractopamine. Coupled with HPLC-UV, this method demonstrated a linearity within 2.0-800 ng/g for ractopamine with spiking in pork muscles (R2=0.9958). The LOD was 0.64 ng/g (S/N=3) and recoveries ranged from 85.2 to 108.1% (n=3). This approach provides a feasible way for analysis of trace ractopamine in biological samples.

J		Chujun Liu; Yawen Guo; Bo Wang; Lan Chen; Kaizhou Xie; Chenggen Yang							Establishment and validation of a GC-MS/MS method for the quantification of penicillin g residues in poultry eggs.		Foods					A simple and sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) method was established for the quantitative screening of penicillin G residues in chicken and duck eggs (whole egg, yolk and albumen). The analyte was separated on a TG-1MS capillary column (30.0m * 0.25mm i. D., 0.25mum) with an external calibration method and electron impact (EI) ionization. Samples were pretreated using an accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) procedure followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE) on HLB cartridges (60mg/3mL). The derivative, which was safer and easier to store than penicillin G, was obtained by reacting trimethylsilyl diazomethane (TMSD) with penicillin G. The method was validated by the following parameters: linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ). The matrix-matched calibration curves had good linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9994) within the concentration range of LOQ-200.0 g/kg for penicillin G in the sample matrices. In the same concentration range, the accuracy, in terms of recovery, was 80.31-94.50%; the relative standard deviation (RSD), intra-day RSD and inter-day RSD ranged from 1.24 to 3.44%, 2.13 to 4.82% and 2.74 to 6.13%, respectively. The LODs and LOQs of penicillin G in the matrices were in the ranges of 1.70-3.20 and 6.10-8.50mug/kg, respectively. The applicability of the GC-MS/MS method was demonstrated by the determination of poultry eggs obtained from local markets with no penicillin G residues. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Research International					In our previous work, dynamic high-pressure microfluidization (DHPM) treatment was shown to promote the interaction between chitosan (CS) and potato protein isolate (PPI), but the modification mechanism of DHPM treatment (6 k-12 k psi) on PPI and its complex with CS remains to be elucidated. Here, moderate DHPM treatment (≤9k psi) was found to decrease the particle size, increase the surface charge, and improve the solubility of PPI and its emulsifying and foaming properties. The PPI functional properties were further improved by CS addition followed by DHPM treatment. The ultraviolet and fluorescence spectral results showed that DHPM treatment could destroy the PPI molecular structure, while CS addition could provide a protective mechanism against PPI damage, which was also proved by the surface hydrophobicity. The circular dichroism spectral analysis exhibited that DHPM treatment could convert different types of secondary structures by disrupting the PPI intermolecular hydrogen bonds, while CS addition could promote the formation of hydrogen bonds in the system, which was also demonstrated by infrared spectroscopy. The sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results exhibited that DHPM treatment (≤12 k psi) was not sufficient to reduce the PPI molecular mass, while DHPM treatment (6 k-12 k psi) could destroy the structure of CS/PPI complex. The thermodynamic analysis showed that the PPI thermodynamic stability could be improved by DHPM treatment, but decreased by CS addition plus DHPM treatment. These results showed that DHPM treatment has a good potential to modify the PPI and CS/PPI complex.

J		Chun Li; Xiaoqian Chen; Zhao Jin; Zixuan Gu; Jiajia Rao; Bingcan Chen							Physicochemical property changes and aroma differences of fermented yellow pea flours: role of Lactobacilli and fermentation time.		Food & Function					The aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical properties and aroma differences of yellow pea flours fermented by five lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains including two Lactiplantibacillus, two Lactobacillus, and one Lacticaseibacillus with different fermentation time. The cell population and the pH of pea flour slurry, as well as the proximate chemical composition, amino acids, thermal and pasting properties, surface morphology, and aromatic differences of fermented flours were characterized. The cell population of all strains except for Lactobacillus helveticus was observed to reach above 107 CFU mL-1 after 24 h of fermentation. The fermentation with Lactobacilli resulted in the increase of amino acids and ash contents, and the reduction of fat content. Rapid viscosity analysis indicated that short time (18 h) fermentation with L. helveticus drastically improved the pasting properties of the flours by facilitating starch granule expansion. The aromatic compounds of the fermented yellow pea flours were highly reliant on the strains and fermentation time. The untargeted metabolomics analysis with the aid of multivariate data analysis can discriminate the aroma differences among the fermented yellow pea flours. L. acidophilus fermentation led to the production of three aromatic compounds which may contribute to an improved aromatic profile. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	15	6950	6963	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00608h					FSTA:2021-12-Jp16066

Food Chemistry					Ultrasonic degradation has become a fascinating strategy for preparing modified pectin, contributing to the improvement of pectin's functional characteristics. In this study, the impacts of structural and conformational characteristics of original and ultrasound-treated citrus pectins on their functional properties were examined. The results showed that compared with ultrasound-treated pectins, untreated pectin presented higher rheological and gelling properties primarily attributed to its larger weight-average molecular weight (Mw), degree of methoxylation, amount of neutral sugar side chains, and z-average radius of gyration, as well as the more extended flexible-chain conformation. However, the ultrasound-treated pectins had better emulsifying properties than untreated pectin in an oil-in-water emulsion system. These properties, visually suggested by morphology analysis, including enhanced emulsifying capacity, emulsifying stability, reduced mean droplet size and negatively charged zeta potential. Moreover, the Mw and chain conformation of untreated and ultrasound-treated pectins played more decisive roles in their functional properties than the others.

Journal of Functional Foods					The aim was to investigate whether Grifola frondosa fraction (Mw>5000D) (GF5000) could restore the gut microbiota dysbiosis to improves insulin resistance in diabetic rats. Oral glucose tolerance test and serum biochemical parameter were assessed of the hypoglycemic activity of GF5000 (112.5 and 675mg/kg/d, i.g.) in diabetic rats for 48 d. The mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory markers in epididymal white adipose tissue were determined by qPCR and western blotting. In rats intestinal tissue, sequencing of the V3-4 region of 16S rRNA genes were analyzed. GF5000 significantly lowered fasting serum glucose (P< 0.05), the area under the curve (P< 0.01), insulin resistance index (P< 0.01) and serum lipids profile (P< 0.05) in diabetic rats.

J		Chun Yue Wei; Dan Zhu; Nystrom, L.							Improving wholegrain product quality by selecting lipid-stable wheat varieties.		Food Chemistry					Lipid oxidation is one of the major quality issues of wholegrain wheat flour and products, despite their rich endogenous antioxidants. Diverse wheat germplasm resources are available for industrial production and breeding selection. Therefore, to improve the stability qualities of wholegrain, it is important to study lipid stability of wheat varieties, together with their endogenous antioxidant contents. In this study, 65 wheat varieties were evaluated for their oxidative stabilities under accelerated conditions. Primary and secondary oxidation products, radical scavenging activities, and tocol contents were analyzed to obtain a comprehensive understanding of lipid oxidation in wholegrain flour. The results showed significant diversity of lipid stability in the wheat varieties, with a 30-fold difference in hexanal content after 19 weeks of storage. Varieties, such as "Velocity" and "Arina", with high stability and high antioxidant contents, are potentially better suited for stable wholegrain products. The findings will benefit consumers with better quality wholegrain products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	345				0308-8146				10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.128683					FSTA:2021-06-Mj3504

Food Chemistry					Zijuan tea is a representative anthocyanin-rich tea cultivar in China. In this study, Zijuan tea was used to produce a novel kombucha beverage (ZTK). The physicochemical, sensory properties, and antioxidant activity of ZTK were compared with that of black tea kombucha (BTK) and green tea kombucha (GTK). Results indicated that after fermentation, the color of ZTK changed from yellowish-brown to salmon-pink, because its anthocyanins (4.5 mg/L) appeared red in acidic conditions. Meanwhile no significant changes of color were observed in BTK and GTK. The dynamic changes of pH, biomass, and concentrations of sugars, amino acids, and main organic acids were similar in three kombucha beverages, except catechins showing different trends.

J		Chun-Hsiang Chan; Ri-Gui Wu; Yi-Yuan Shao							The effects of ultrasonic treatment on physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility of semigelatinized high amylose maize starch.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study aimed to observe and quantify the high-and low-temperature ultrasonication impact of semigelatinized high amylose maize starch on physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility. High-and low-temperature ultrasonication did not increase the degree of gelatinization, but generated cracks and pores on the starch granule surface and enhanced the short-range ordered molecular structure and apparent amylose content (AAC). Compared with incubation treatments, high-temperature ultrasonication gradually increased the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS), whereas low-temperature ultrasonication only decreased RS. Principal component analysis (PCA) and multivariate linear regression results showed that SDS and RS were significantly affected by the long-range ordered molecular structure, a molecular weight distribution of amylopectin, enthalpy change and AAC, whereas the short-range ordered molecular structure further dominated RS. Our results improved the understanding of physicochemical property changes in low-and high-temperature ultrasonication on semigelatinized high amylose maize starch and differentiated the significant principal components of SDS and RS formation.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Crispness is an important textural attribute of puffed snacks. Impregnation pretreatment is used to regulate the texture of puffed products by changing the cell structure and mechanical properties. In this study, the influence of citric acid and sucrose pretreatment on the cell structure, cell wall components, and mechanical properties of peach slices before puffing drying (heat-pressed slices) was evaluated to understand how citric acid and sucrose pretreatment affects the pore structures and texture characteristics of peach chips with improved crispness. Cell wall degradation, cell structure morphology and mechanical properties before puffing drying interacts to govern the pore morphology and texture characteristics of peach chips. Micrographs of heat-pressed slices showed swollen structures for Cit (citric acid) treated samples and compacted structures for Cit + Suc (citric acid and sucrose) and Cit + Suc + Sdp (citric acid, sucrose and sodium dihydrogen phosphate) treated samples. An increased elastic modulus and decreased viscosity index were observed in all Cit-, Cit + Suc- and Cit + Suc + Sdp-treated samples. After puffing drying, Cit prompted the generation of large pores with low hardness, and Suc and Sdp enhanced the emergence of uniform and small pores with increased hardness. Therefore, crispness was attained by regulating crumbly texture through Cit and regulating hard texture through Suc and Sdp.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This paper investigated the formation of a novel complex coacervate between gliadin (G) and sodium alginate (SA) as well as its relationship with the encapsulation and controlled release properties by loading curcumin (Cur). G-SA coacervates (GSAC) were fabricated using the anti-solvent method to form gliadin nanoparticles (GNPs) and then electrostatic deposition with SA to form coacervates. Based on the turbidimetric analysis and zeta-potential results, coacervates were formed at a wide range of pH (1.0-7.0) through electrostatic interaction in the gliadin-SA system. The gliadin-SA interaction was spontaneous exothermic process shown by the isothermal titration calorimetry. The spherical particles of curcumin-loading G-SA coacervates (GSAC-Cur) with well-homogeneity and great-dispersion as well as particle aggregation were observed on SEM. At coacervated pH s, GSAC-Cur showed particle size from 433.55 to 1496.50 nm, PDI around 0.28, zeta-potential from -1.9 to -50.9 mV and encapsulation efficiency from 61.29% to 81.01%. Controlled release profiles confirmed that G-SA coacervates reduced the released speed of curcumin in the release process. In summary, we concluded that the properties of GSAC-Cur corresponding to the embedding and controlled release could be better by forming coacervates via pH-induced.

Food Chemistry					In order to reveal the color formation mechanism of blood-red edible bird's nests (EBNs) and develop a quick and specific strategy to distinguish the artificial fake one, multiple methods of UPLC-TOF/MS, UV, NMR, FT-IR and 2D IR were used to detect the chemical markers of the reddening reaction, the results showed that the reddening substances were C9H10N2O5 and C9H9NO6, which were verified as products of a phenol-keto tautomerism evolved from l-tyrosine. Moreover, natural and artificial red EBNs with varying degrees of chemical fumigation also can be successfully distinguished using the chemical markers, and the protein variation in SDS-PAGE gel could also support the distinction. This work established a systematic method of chemical identification for both natural and artificial blood-red EBNs, and provided a new identification strategy for food safety control that can promote the development of a healthier market of EBNs.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Zanthoxylum ailanthoides is a traditional spice crop in Taiwan with unique smells and tastes that differ between prickly (young) and nonprickly (mature) leaves. Different volatile terpenes between prickly young and nonprickly mature leaves were identified and considered to be one of the sources of their aromas. A transcriptome database was established to explore the biosynthesis of these compounds, and candidate terpene synthase genes were identified. The functions of these synthases were investigated using recombinant protein reactions in both purification and coexpression assays. ZaTPS1, ZaTPS2, and ZaTPS3 are germacrene D synthases, with different amino acid sequences. The main products of ZaTPS4 are trans-alpha-bergamotene and (E)-beta-farnesene, whereas ZaTPS5 forms multiple products, and ZaTPS6 produces beta-caryophyllene. ZaTPS7 forms monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene and sesquiterpene (E, E)-alpha-farnesene. Reverse transcription PCR of ZaTPS gene expression in young and mature leaves revealed that ZaTPS1 was responsible for the mellow aroma in mature leaves. The expression of ZaTPS6 suggested that it plays a role in the background aromas of both types of leaves. Our findings deepened the understanding of the volatile compounds of Z. ailanthoides and revealed the source of its unique aromas by clarifying the biosynthesis of these compounds.										2021	69	42	12494	12504	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04232					FSTA:2022-04-Te1375
J		Chun-yan Peng; Hua-dong Zhu; Lu Zhang; Xiao-feng Li; Wen-na Zhou; Zong-cai Tu							Urolithin A alleviates advanced glycation end-product formation by altering protein structures, trapping methylglyoxal and forming complexes.		Food & Function					Urolithin A (UroA) is a first-in-class natural compound derived from the gut microbiota-derived metabolites of ellagitannins. This research for the first time evaluates the mechanisms of UroA inhibiting advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation by fluorescence spectroscopy, molecular docking, liquid chromatography (LC) and LC-Oribitrap tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that UroA exhibited a good suppression effect on the formation of AGEs in human serum albumin (HSA)-fructose and HSA-methylglyoxal (MGO) systems. Further mechanism analysis revealed that UroA alleviated AGE formation by changing the conformational structure of HSA, trapping reactive MGO to form mono-MGO-UroA complexes, promoting the exposure of chromophores to a more hydrophobic micro-environment, and forming stable UroA-HSA complexes. UroA bound with HSA in an equimolar manner, the binding was an exothermic spontaneous process, subdomain IIIA was the preferred binding pocket, and hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions and van der Waals forces were the major interaction forces. The number of glycation sites detected in glycated HSA was reduced by 1 and 2, respectively, when 181.82 and 363.64 muM UroA was added. These could provide an insight into the mechanism of UroA inhibiting HSA glycation, and highlight its value as a promising glycation inhibitor in the prevention of diabetic complications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	23	11849	11861	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02631c					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4621

Food & Function					Rosa davurica Pall. (RDP) fruits are popularly consumed as beverages and healthy food in China because of their various beneficial activities. In particular, flavonoids are one of the major active ingredients of RDP fruits with predominant pharmacological effects. However, the anti-obesity activities of flavonoids from RDP fruits and their regulation effect on the gut microbiota have not been determined. In the present study, the flavonoid-rich extracts (RDPF) were isolated from RDP fruits and their anti-obesity effects were investigated using a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mouse model. The results showed that RDPF intervention significantly inhibited the body weight, liver weight, kidney weight and epididymal adipose tissue weight of HFD-fed mice without affecting the calorie intake. Plasma lipid levels were also significantly lowered by RDPF treatment. Histological examination showed that RDPF supplementation partially recovered HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in the liver. RDPF also prevented oxidative injury of the liver, as evidenced by the altered superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBPalpha), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1C (SREBP-1C), fatty acid synthase (FAS), acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPARalpha) and CAT mRNA in the livers of mice were also regulated by RDPF administration. 16S rRNA gene sequence data further indicated that RDPF addition increased the microbial diversity and reshaped the community composition. Intriguingly, RDPF intervention did not exhibit inhibitory tendency toward the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes, but markedly decreased the relative abundance of Erysipelotrichaceae. This study provided novel insights into the application of RDPF in the food industry. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	10097	10106	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01373d					FSTA:2022-02-Jg1625
J		ChunFang Song; Xiaotong Ma; Jiaoling Wang; Tianhang Ding; Weidong Song							Effects of ultrasound and blanching pretreatments on mass transfer and qualities of hot-air drying of perilla (Perilla frutescens L.) leaves.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The work investigated the influences of blanching (B) and ultrasonic-assisted blanching (UB) as pretreatment on mass transfer, drying kinetics, color, contents of nutrient, and aroma compounds of hot-air-dried perilla leaves. The samples were pretreated at two temperatures (70 °C and 80 °C) and two durations of pretreatment (1 min and 3 min). Principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to distinguish sample characteristics of different pretreatments. The results showed that the condition of UB pretreatment had a higher drying rate compared to B pretreatment. The effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) of pretreatment for UB is higher than B. The UB pretreatment method yielded the lower DeltaE value and higher preserved content of chlorophyll, flavonoid, and rosemary acid at the pretreatment temperature of 70 °C. Moreover, GC-MS results showed a lower perilla ketone relative content under the same conditions. According to the results, the quality of the dried perilla leaves after performing low-temperature UB pretreatment (70 °C) was improved relatively. Practical applications. Perilla leaves are rich in antioxidant substances and have extensive culinary usage given their characteristic aroma and flavor. Convective drying is known to have some adverse effects on agricultural products. However, Ultrasonic pretreatment, as a modern food processing technology, can shorten the drying time and preserve the color, aroma, and nutrient content of food. The purpose of this study was to investigate the quality of dried perilla leaves with B and UB pretreatments, and to compare the differences in drying characteristics, color, nutrient content, and aroma compounds by different pretreatments. The pretreatment and dehydration parameters should be considered with respect to further utilization of dried perilla leaves. Nonetheless, sonication is worth to be taken into account due to the significant effects of energy expenditures, inhibiting browning of perilla leaves without damaging the quality of final product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15947					FSTA:2022-04-Jq4662

Food Chemistry					This study was the first to evaluate changes in isoflavone, amino acid, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), antioxidant effect, and digestive enzyme inhibition during fermentation of soy-milk to soy-yogurt with L. brevis and L. Plantarum. Total average isoflavones were reduced (1318.2 971.1 mug/g) with an increase of aglycones (60.2 804.9 mug/g, genistein > daidzein > glycitein) in soy powder yogurts (SPYs). Amino acids increased considerably, as did ornithine (average 4.1 551.0 mg/g), and CLA showed high variations from not-detected (ND) to 0.5,0.9 mg/g (cis-9, trans-11) and ND to 0.3,0.2 mg/g (trans-10, cis-12). Digestive enzyme inhibitions (alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and pancreatic lipase) displayed high activities (average 50.6 67.2,5.2 46.4,10.6 51.4%). Moreover, the antioxidant abilities against radicals were elevated as follows: ABTS > DPPH > hydroxyl (average 63.5 86.5,50.2 70.3,39.3 55.2%). Specifically, SPY using mixed strains exhibited the greatest enzymatic inhibition and antioxidant capacities.

Journal of Functional Foods					Nostoc commune has abundant bioactive compounds, which are valuable in medical, cosmeceutical, and nutraceutical fields. Currently, the demand for native bioactive compounds in the cosmetic industry is greater than ever, especially with regard to algae extracts. In this study, we evaluated the biochemical compounds, safety, and effect on wound-healing and anti-allergic properties of Nostoc commune polysaccharide-rich extract (NCPE) in an in vitro study. The results showed that an extract with 221.6925.56 mg g-1 polysaccharide mainly consists of glucose (73.2%) with abundant bioactive compounds (total phenolic, total flavonoids, and sulfates) and some elements (K, Sr, Mn, Ba, and Ni). Cytotoxicity and heavy metal assays revealed that the extract was safe and available. Cell culture experiments showed that the polysaccharide effectively inhibits IL-6, and beta-hexosaminidase, but promotes collagen I secretion. These findings suggest that the extract may be a useful resource in the development of wound-healing and anti-allergic cosmetics.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Glutamate (Glu) and aspartate (Asp) are the most abundant amino acids in various sources of protein waste, recognized as a sustainable resource. In this study, Escherichia coli was engineered to produce succinic acid (SA) from Glu and Asp. Succinate dehydrogenase involved in the tricarboxylic acid was inactivated in the Glu-utilizing strain. To grow on Asp, this mutant strain was subjected to metabolic evolution. One resulting strain capable of metabolizing Asp was further evolved to improve the growth of Glu and Asp. After the deletion of arcA, the resulting strain was employed for the aerobic production of SA. The shake-flask culture was conducted with the minimal medium containing 10 g/L Glu and 10 g/L Asp. Finally, it resulted in the SA production, with a titer, the molar yield, and productivity reaching 72.8 mM (i.e., 8.6 g/L), 0.54 (ca. 75.4% of the theoretical yield), and 0.66 g/L/h, respectively.

Food Analytical Methods					The objective of this study was to establish and validate an UHPLC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) in either free or bound form in milk powder. The target analytes in free form in milk powder were extracted by 1% trichloroacetic acid, while target analytes in bound form were hydrolyzed by hydrochloric acid to cleave the protein amide bond and consequently dissociated. After extraction and purification, Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and Nepsilon-(1-carboxyethyl) lysine (CEL) were quantified by internal standard method and pyrraline (Pyr) was by external standard method. Results. Revealed that three target analytes displayed excellent linearity in their corresponding concentration ranges. Limits of quantifications (LOQs) were in the range of 20-95 mug/kg. The average recoveries of three target analytes spiked at three concentration levels were in the ranges of 81.8-107.2% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 3.5-8.1%. Finally, the described method was proved to be suitable for the quantification of these AGEs in milk powder products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	7	1472	1481	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-01986-6					FSTA:2021-10-Pn5258

Postharvest Biology and Technology					This study attempted to provide evidence for the inhibitory efficiency of beta-aminobutyric acid (BABA) treatments on postharvest decay development, soluble sugar accumulation, and sensory profiles in peach fruit and to analyze the possible transcriptional regulation involved. Specifically, 100 mmol L-1 BABA directly induced resistance as manifested by suppression of postharvest decay progression in peaches, and this suppression was accompanied by the consistently upregulated expression of the WRKY transcription factor PpWRKY40 and a battery of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes, such as PpNPR1s, PpPR1s, PpPR2s and PpPR5s, throughout the storage period. However, treatment with 10 mmol L-1 BABA ignited priming resistance in peaches that underwent hostile conditions of high pressure during the late monitoring period. The peaches elicited by 10 mmol L-1 BABA had higher expression levels of PpSSs, PpSPSs and PpSPPs as well as lower expression levels of PpNIs and PpAIs than those treated with 100 mmol L-1 BABA, thus resulting in increases in soluble sugar content and the sweetness score during storage. On the other hand, the direct interaction between persistently highly expressed PpWRKY40 and the regulatory protein PpNPR1 was detected in vivo and in vitro by Y2H and pull-down assays; in addition, Y1H and DLR assays demonstrated that PpWRKY40 bound to the W-box motif in the promoter of sucrose-metabolizing enzyme genes, including PpSS1 and PpSPS3, and activated their transcription. Hence, we deduced that the dual regulation of key genes associated with systemic acquired resistance (SAR) and sucrose metabolism by PpWRKY40 might be conducive to the balance of fitness and defense in BABA-primed resistance by maintaining soluble sugar accumulation at an intermediate level and activating resistance against stress in harvested peaches.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Chiral diniconazole is a widely used triazole fungicide, while its enantioselective behaviors in fruits have not been reported. In this article, the absolute configuration was confirmed. A fast supercritical fluid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (SFC-MS/MS) method was developed for the chiral separation and enantioselective study of diniconazole in four kinds of fruits. The residual concentrations gradually decreased with time in four kinds of fruits after applying diniconazole. The dissipation half-lives of R-diniconazole and S-diniconazole were in the range of 5.3-7.9 and 2.5-7.1 days respectively, and S-diniconazole was degraded preferentially. The residue concentrations were lower than the EU's MRL (0.01 mg/kg) on the 40th (harvest time), 30th, and 10th day in pear, jujube, and apple, respectively. But, in peach, residue concentrations were still higher than the MRL after 60 days and the ratio of R/S was 2.2. These results could be helpful for the reasonable use and risk assessment of chiral diniconazole.										2021	69	51	15512	15520	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03852					FSTA:2022-05-Jb5759

Food Chemistry					Construction of nanoscale delivery systems from natural food biopolymer complexes have attracted increasing interests in the fields of food industries. In this study, novel carboxymethyl konjac glucomannan/chitosan (CMKGM/CS) nanogels with and without 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)/N-hydroxysuccinimide) (EDC/NHS)-initiated crosslinking were prepared. The physicochemical and structural properties of the CMKGM/CS nanogels and their potential to be a delivery vehicle for curcumin were investigated. Compared to original uncrosslinked nanogels, crosslinking did not alter particle size and morphology but decreased zeta potential of nanogels. Fourier transform infrared spectrum confirmed that the amide linkage was formed between CMKGM and CS, which obviously enhanced the stability of crosslinked nanogels under gastrointestinal conditions. Furthermore, the crosslinked nanogels not only had higher encapsulation efficiency of curcumin but also better sustained release behavior under simulated gastrointestinal conditions. These findings suggested that the crosslinked CMKGM/CS nanogels might be a promising delivery system for nutrients.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Lipolytic enzymes are essential biocatalysts in food processing as well as pharmaceutical and pesticide industries, catalyzing the cleavage of ester bonds in a variety of acyl chain substrates. Here, we report the crystal structure of an esterase from the deep-sea hydrothermal vent of the East Pacific Rise (EprEst). The X-ray structure of EprEst in complex with the ligand, acetate, has been determined at 2.03 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals a unique spatial arrangement and orientation of the helix cap domain and alpha/beta hydrolase domain, which form a substrate pocket with preference for short-chain acyl groups. Molecular docking analysis further demonstrated that the active site pocket could accommodate p-nitrophenyl (pNP) carboxyl ligands of varying lengths (≤6 C atoms), with pNP-butyrate ester predicted to have the highest binding affinity. Additionally, the semirational design was conducted to improve the thermostability of EprEst by enzyme engineering based on the established structure and multiple sequence alignment. A mutation, K114P, introduced in the hinge region of the esterase, which displayed increased thermostability and enzyme activity. Collectively, the structural and functional data obtained herein could be used as basis for further protein engineering to ultimately expand the scope of industrial applications of marine-derived lipolytic enzymes.										2021	69	3	1079	1090	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06338					FSTA:2021-06-Be0779

Food Chemistry					There is increasing interest in the development of low-oil emulsion gels, but little is known about fabrication of low-oil emulsion gels by adjusting oil phase. Here, we reported a facile strategy to produce an ultrastable (at least 6 months) low-oil (25% oil) emulsion gels by solidifying the oil phase. The formation and stabilization mechanisms were explored. Beeswax (BW) encased liquid oil within the crystal network, forming solidified droplets. These solidified droplets promoted droplet-droplet interaction and tended to form network, further promoting gelling. Both linear and nonlinear rheology strongly supported the fact that BW enhanced the interaction of solidified droplets and strengthened the gel structure. Finally, we utilized low-oil emulsion gels as a delivery system of curcumin. The storage stabilities of curcumin at 4 and 20 °C were improved with 1, 3 and 5 wt% BW concentrations. This strategy greatly enriches emulsion gel formulations and their applications in foods.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The chemical quality and biochemical properties of green tea processed from different tea shoot maturity has largely remained unexplored thus far. Total phenolic content, and total flavonoid content decreased during tea shoot maturation. Three in-vitro bioactivities, namely alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory and antioxidant activity showed a similar changing trend. A significant correlation between TPC and TFC, and these bioactivities was found. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that green tea processed from different tea shoot maturity had obvious differences. Variable importance analysis and S-plot gave 32 characteristic metabolites responsible for the discrimination of different green teas. Orthogonal partial least square analysis was used calculate the correlation coefficient between each characteristic metabolite and the values of three in-vitro bioactivities.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Apart from geographical difference and processing method, the maturity of fresh tea shoot is an important factor that determines tea quality. However, the quality development and chemical variation of green tea with tea shoot maturity remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic consequences of tea shoot maturity on the taste and aroma quality of green tea by metabolite profiling. In terms of taste quality, a concentration-dependent decrease with tea shoot age was observed in gallic acid and caffeine. The levels of catechin, epicatechin, and epigallocatechin increased with tea shoot maturity, whereas those of epicatechin gallate, epigallocatechin gallate, and total catechins decreased. Furthermore, the maximum contents of most amino acids were recorded in green tea processed from one bud with two leaves. In terms of aroma quality, volatile profiles of green tea were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry combined with chemometrics. A total of 32 differential volatile organic compounds showing significant differences were identified and divided into Groups I and II, which contribute undesirable flavor and sweet flowery aroma to tea, respectively. The relative abundance of Group I increased with tea shoot maturity whereas that of Group II decreased. These findings can be used in guiding the production of green tea.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Carotenoids are a group of tetraterpene pigments widely used in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. Torulene, torularhodin, and beta-carotene, three principal carotenoids synthesized by Rhodotorula glutinis ZHK, possess strong health-promoting properties such as antioxidant, provitamin A, and antitumor. Here, the effect of different salt conditions on carotenoids production of R. glutinis ZHK was investigated. The results showed that the total carotenoids were significantly enhanced in 0.5 M (3.91 mg/L) and 0.75 M (5.41 mg/L) NaCl treatments than that in 1.0 M (0.35 mg/L) and control (1.42 mg/L) after 120 h of cultivation. Of which, the increase in torulene and torularhodin production acts as the main contributor to the enhancement of total carotenoids. Transcriptome profiling revealed that salt stress efficiently promotes the gene expression of crtI, which could explain the molecular mechanisms of the enhanced torulene and torularhodin production under salt stress. Further experiments indicated that torulene and torularhodin play an important role in quenching excrescent reactive oxygen species induced by salt stress. Together, the present study reports an effective strategy for simultaneously improving torulene and torularhodin production in R. glutinis ZHK.										2021	69	38	11523	11533	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04028					FSTA:2022-02-Bi0180
J		Chunjun Yan; Zheng Zhou							Walnut pellicle phenolics greatly influence the extraction and structural properties of walnut protein isolates.		Food Research International					This study investigated the effects of walnut phenolics and extraction methods on the composition and structural properties of walnut protein isolates (WPIs). Fluorescence quenching experiments showed that walnut phenolics could bind to walnut globulins, albumins, and glutelins with apparent affinity constants of 5.49*104 M-1, 1.71*104 M-1, and 3.10*104 M-1, respectively. However, the UV turbidity and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements indicated that phenolics could lead to the severe precipitation of globulins and albumins but not glutelins. The removal of pellicles could significantly increase the yield rate of salt-soluble globulins to approximately 72.8%. Furthermore, salt-and alkaline-extraction methods could produce comparable WPIs yields when using pellicle-free walnut kernels. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and size-exclusive chromatography indicated that the major protein compositions of the salt-and alkaline-extracted WPIs from pellicle-free walnut kernels were similar, while alkaline-extracted WPIs from kernels with pellicles exhibited phenolic-induced protein aggregation. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicated that WPIs produced from kernels with pellicles contained more alpha-helix and less beta-sheet structures than WPIs produced from pellicle-free kernels. These results confirm that walnut pellicle phenolics and the extraction methods could greatly influence the composition and structural properties of WPIs.

J		Chunjun Yan; Zheng Zhou							Solubility and emulsifying properties of phosphorylated walnut protein isolate extracted by sodium trimetaphosphate.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Low solubility and poor emulsifying properties of walnut protein isolate (WPI) greatly influences its applications in the food industry. In the current work, WPI was extracted and phosphorylated from defatted walnut flour by sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) at various pH values (7.0, 9.0, and 11.0). The measured phosphorus content of STMP-extracted WPI was approximately 7-10-fold higher than that of the alkaline-extracted WPI (A-WPI). The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) further confirmed the successful phosphorylation of extracted WPI. Conformational studies using FTIR and circular dichroism (CD) indicated that phosphorylated WPI (P-WPI) contained higher alpha-helical and lower beta-sheet contents than the A-WPI. Phosphorylation of WPIs altered the surface hydrophobicity and surface charges of the proteins, resulting in a significant improvement in the solubility of P-WPI. In addition, the emulsifying properties of P-WPI were significantly enhanced, which was exhibited by a 2.5-4-fold increase in the emulsifying activity index (EAI) and a maximum 6-fold increase in the emulsifying stability index (ESI). The emulsions stabilized by P-WPI manifested relatively smaller sizes and larger surface charges. This study demonstrated that phosphorylation modification can effectively modulate the surface hydrophobicity and charges of WPI to greatly improve its solubility and emulsifying ability.

J		Chunlei Ni; Bailiang Li; Yangyue Ding; Yue Wu; Qiuye Wang; Jiarong Wang; Jianjun Cheng							Anti-cancer properties of coix seed oil against HT-29 colon cells through regulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.		Foods					This study aims to observe the effects of coix seed oil (CSO) on HT-29 cells and investigate its possible regulation mechanism of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Fatty acid analysis showed that coix seed oil mainly contains oleic acid (50.54%), linoleic acid (33.76%), palmitic acid (11.74%), and stearic acid (2.45%). Fourier transform infrared results found that the fatty acid functional groups present in the oil matched well with the vegetable oil band. The results from CCK-8 assays showed that CSO dose-dependently and time-dependently inhibited the viability of HT-29 cells in vitro. CSO inhibited cell viability, with IC50 values of 5.30 mg/mL for HT-29 obtained after 24 h treatment. Morphological changes were observed by apoptotic body/cell nucleus DNA (Hoechst 33258) staining using inverted and fluorescence microscopy. Moreover, flow cytometry analysis was used to evaluate the cell cycle and cell apoptosis. It showed that CSO induced cell apoptosis and cycle arrest in the G2 phase. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting revealed that CSO induced cell apoptosis by downregulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. Additionally, CSO can cause apoptosis in cancer cells by activating caspase-3, up-regulating Bax, and down-regulating Bcl-2. In conclusion, the results revealed that CSO induced G2 arrest and apoptosis of HT-29 cells by regulating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Control					Photosensitization is a novel, non-thermal and effective technology to inactivate microorganisms. The inhibitory effect and its mechanism of curcumin-based photosensitization on plant pathogen B. cinerea are investigated in this study. Significant changes have been observed upon photosensitization, which include a reduction of 96.2% in spore germination when spores were mixed with 0.5 mM curcumin and exposed for 5 min, a complete control on lesion enlargement of gray mold in apple fruit after 10 min. Morphological changes, losses of membrane integrity and variations of cell wall polysaccharide deposition in treated B. cinerea cells were observed. Furthermore, after photosensitization, a series of apoptotic characteristics, such as the accumulation of ROS and Ca2+, the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and nuclear fragmentation were observed. Collectively, these data provided evidence that curcumin-based photosensitization is an effective method to control the plant pathogen B. cinerea.

J. de; Vos, P. de							Human milk oligosaccharides and non-digestible carbohydrates prevent adhesion of specific pathogens via modulating glycosylation or inflammatory genes in intestinal epithelial cells.		Food & Function					Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) and non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) are known to inhibit the adhesion of pathogens to the gut epithelium, but the mechanisms involved are not well understood. Here, the effects of 2′-FL, 3-FL, DP3-DP10, DP10-DP60 and DP30-DP60 inulins and DM7, DM55 and DM69 pectins were studied on pathogen adhesion to Caco-2 cells. As the growth phase influences virulence, E. coli ET8, E. coli LMG5862, E. coli O119, E. coli WA321, and S. enterica subsp. enterica LMG07233 from both log and stationary phases were tested. Specificity for enteric pathogens was tested by including the lung pathogen K. pneumoniae LMG20218. Expression of the cell membrane glycosylation genes of galectin and glycocalyx and inflammatory genes was studied in the presence and absence of 2′-FL or NDCs. Inhibition of pathogen adhesion was observed for 2′-FL, inulins, and pectins. Pre-incubation with 2′-FL downregulated ICAM1, and pectins modified the glycosylation genes. In contrast, K. pneumoniae LMG20218 downregulated the inflammatory genes, but these were restored by pre-incubation with pectins, which reduced the adhesion of K. pneumoniae LMG20218. In addition, DM69 pectin significantly upregulated the inflammatory genes. 2′-FL and pectins but not inulins inhibited pathogen adhesion to the gut epithelial Caco-2 cells through changing the cell membrane glycosylation and inflammatory genes, but the effects were molecule-, pathogen-, and growth phase-dependent. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	17	8100	8119	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00872b					FSTA:2021-12-Pa6810
J		Chunli Kong; Akkerman, R.; Klostermann, C. E.; Beukema, M.; Oerlemans, M. M. P.; Schols, H. A.; Vos, P. de							Distinct fermentation of human milk oligosaccharides 3-FL and LNT2 and GOS/inulin by infant gut microbiota and impact on adhesion of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 to gut epithelial cells.		Food & Function					Human milk oligosaccharides (hMOs) are unique bioactive components in human milk. 3-Fucosyllactose (3-FL) is an abundantly present hMO that can be produced in sufficient amounts to allow application in infant formula. Lacto-N-triaose II (LNT2) can be obtained by acid hydrolysis of lacto-N-neotetraose (LNnT). Both 3-FL and LNT2 have been shown to have health benefits, but their impact on infant microbiota composition and microbial metabolic products such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) is unknown. To gain more insight in fermentability, we performed in vitro fermentation studies of 3-FL and LNT2 using pooled fecal microbiota from 12-week-old infants. The commonly investigated galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS)/inulin (9:1) served as control. Compared to GOS/inulin, we observed a delayed utilization of 3-FL, which was utilized at 60.3% after 36 h of fermentation, and induced the gradual production of acetic acid and lactic acid. 3-FL specifically enriched bacteria of Bacteroides and Enterococcus genus. LNT2 was fermented much faster. After 14 h of fermentation, 90.1% was already utilized, and production of acetic acid, succinic acid, lactic acid and butyric acid was observed. LNT2 specifically increased the abundance of Collinsella, as well as Bifidobacterium. The GOS present in the GOS/inulin mixture was completely fermented after 14 h, while for inulin, only low DP was rapidly utilized after 14 h. To determine whether the fermentation might lead to enhanced colonization of commensal bacteria to gut epithelial cells, we investigated adhesion of the commensal Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 to Caco-2 cells. The fermentation digesta of LNT2 collected after 14 h, 24 h, and 36 h, and GOS/inulin after 24 h of fermentation significantly increased the adhesion of L. plantarum WCFS1 to Caco-2 cells, while 3-FL had no such effect. Our findings illustrate that fermentation of hMOs is very structure-dependent and different from the commonly applied GOS/inulin, which might lead to differential potencies to stimulate adhesion of commensal cells to gut epithelium and consequent microbial colonization. This knowledge might contribute to the design of tailored infant formulas containing specific hMO molecules to meet the need of infants during the transition from breastfeeding to formula. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	24	12513	12525	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02563e					FSTA:2022-04-Pn1550
J		Chunli Lei; Engeseth, N. J.							Comparison of growth characteristics, functional qualities, and texture of hydroponically grown and soil-grown lettuce.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Hydroponics has become one of the most popular approaches in today′s agricultural production. Yet it is questionable whether hydroponics produce vegetables with comparable quality to soil-grown vegetables. In this study, hydroponically and soil-grown lettuce were compared for morphology, texture, antioxidant capacity, and functional quality. Giant Caesar lettuce was grown in laboratory-constructed hydroponic or soil systems for 35 days. Above-ground plant size, biomass, and leaf size of hydroponic lettuce were not significantly different from soil-grown lettuce. Hydroponic lettuce had significantly (p< 0.05) longer roots, higher moisture and lower ash. No significant difference in ascorbic acid, chlorophyll, beta-carotenes, and total phenolics was found in freeze-dried lettuce. However, all compounds analyzed were significantly higher in soil-grown lettuce based on fresh weight. Antioxidant capacity of soil-grown lettuce was significantly higher on both dry- (15.32%) and wet-basis (41.20%). Hydroponic lettuce had softer leaves and firmer midribs; potentially linked to increased lignin (24.18%) in plant cell walls. This represents the first comprehensive side-by-side growth study demonstrating that lettuce grown hydroponically is not the same quality as that grown in soil.

J		Chunli Song; Xiaohong Sun; Jiaqi Yang; Jian Ren; Bongkosh Vardhanabhuti; Xiaolan Liu; Yu Fu							TGase-induced glycosylated soy protein products with limited enzymatic hydrolysis showed enhanced foaming property.		European Food Research and Technology					In this study, the impacts of transglutaminase (TGase)-induced glycosylation and limited enzymatic hydrolysis on the foaming property of soy protein isolates (SPI) and the possible underlying mechanisms were investigated. SPI were first glycosylated with oligochitosan by TGase to produce glycosylated samples (GSPI). GSPI were further hydrolyzed using Protamex with controlled degree of hydrolysis (DH of 1%, 2% and 4%). As compared to native SPI, the foaming stability of GSPI sample was increased from 24.3%3.1% to 40.4%7.6%, and the hydrolyzed GSPI showed enhanced foaming property. GSPI-1% DH showed the best foaming capacity and foam stability, increasing about 2.12 folds and 2.33 folds, respectively. Hydrodynamic-size of dominant distribution peak in GSPI and its hydrolysates (1% DH) were about 3090 and 531 nm, respectively, which were bigger than that of SPI (about 220 nm). The presence of oligochitosan in GSPI decreased surface hydrophobicity, and the subsequent hydrolysis generated an opposite effect. GSPI and its hydrolysates had more flexible tertiary conformations as revealed by intrinsic fluorescence study. Overall, high values of negative zeta potential and apparent viscosity of samples might be responsible for the improved foaming property. This study suggested that TGase-induced glycosylation and limited enzymatic hydrolysis are promising techniques for enhancing the foaming property of SPI, which would broaden the applications of SPI in food industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	10	2557	2563	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03815-w					FSTA:2022-01-Gg0261
J		Chunli Wang; Yi Xia; Linghang Qu; Yanju Liu; Xianqiong Liu; Kang Xu							Cardamonin inhibits osteogenic differentiation of human valve interstitial cells and ameliorates aortic valve calcification via interfering in the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 inflammasome pathway.		Food & Function					Cardamonin (CDM) is a natural chalcone with strong anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation-induced osteogenic changes in valve interstitial cells (VICs) play crucial roles in the development of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD), a degenerative disease characterized by degeneration, thickening, fibrosis, and calcification of the heart valve tissues. To investigate the anti-osteogenic differentiation role of CDM in human valve interstitial cells (hVICs), which consequently reverses the calcification of the aortic valve, human VICs were exposed to osteogenic induction medium (OM) with CDM for further cell viability, osteogenic gene and protein expression analyses, and anti-calcification testing. MRNA sequencing was utilized to analyze the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and related signaling pathways as potential molecular targets involved in CDM's anti-calcification activity. Human aortic valve leaflet ex vivo calcific cultures were used to investigate the CDM inhibition of osteogenic differentiation of hVICs at the tissue level. ApoE-/- mice fed with a high-fat (HF) diet were used to evaluate the effect of CDM on aortic valve calcification. No significant CDM cytotoxicity was seen in the hVICs at 10 muM. The addition of CDM to OM prevented calcified nodule accumulation, and a decrease in the gene/protein expression levels of BMP2, RUNX2, SPP1, TNF-alpha, and COL1A2 was observed. Venn diagram analysis of the DEGs identified 666 common DEGs and highlighted the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway (ko04621) as an anti-calcification target of CDM. CDM also repressed the activation of p-AKT, p-ERK1/2, and p-IkappaBalpha, and prevented the OM-induced nuclear transcription of NF-kappaB p65. In the in vitro and ex vivo calcific conditional culture experiments, CDM exhibited anti-inflammatory and anti-calcification effects by suppressing the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and downregulating IL-1beta expression. In vivo, CDM ameliorated aortic valve calcification by interfering with NLRP3 expression. Our study demonstrated that CDM inhibited the phenotypical calcific transformation of hVICs by mediating the inactivation of the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, it is considered to be a promising natural compound for use in preventing the progression of heart valve calcification disease. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	23	11808	11818	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00813g					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4614

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The investigation aimed at determining the impact of sequential simulated digestion on the physicochemical properties and digestive enzymes inhibitory effects of the polysaccharides fraction (MLP-2) of Morus alba L. Leaves as well as its in vitro fermentation behaviours. After artificial salivary, gastric and intestinal digestions, the chemical components and microstructure of MLP-2 were altered with significantly (P< 0.05) decreased molecular weight. The alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of MLP-2 were significantly (P< 0.05) improved throughout simulated digestion. MLP-2I, the intestinal digested fraction of MLP-2, could significantly (P< 0.05) decrease the pH value of fermented culture and increase the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) concentrations, especially acetic, propionic and butyric acids. In conclusion, MLP-2 could be gradually degraded under simulated digestion with altered physicochemical properties and enhanced alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effects, and further utilised by human gut microbiota to decrease pH value and promote SCFA production. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	5	2098	2108	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14759					FSTA:2021-08-Jf11116
J		Chunlin Hu; Jing Xie							The effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on the microstructure and quality of Trachurus murphyi.		Foods					Temperature fluctuation in frozen food storage and distribution is the perpetual and core issue faced by the frozen food industry. Ice recrystallisation induced by temperature fluctuations under cold storage causes microstructural changes in fish products and irreversible damages to cells and tissues, which lower the frozen fish quality in the food chain. This study is intended to explore how repeated freezing-thawing affected the microstructure and quality of Trachurus murphyi during its frozen storage. The results showed the consistency between the increase in ice crystal diameter, volume, and porosity in frozen fish and the increase in centrifugal loss (from 22.4% to 25.69%), cooking loss (from 22.32% to 25.19%), conductivity (from 15.28 Ms/cm to 15.70 Ms/cm), TVB-N (from 16.32 mg N/100 g to 19.94 mg N/100 g), K-value (from 3.73% to 7.07%), and amino acid composition. The muscle structure change observed by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) showed that the content of alpha-helix reduced from 59.05% to 51.83%, while the beta-sheet fraction grew from 15.44% to 17.11%, beta-turns increased from 5.45% to 7.58%, and random coil from 20.06% to 23.49%. Moreover, muscular structure exhibited varying degrees of deterioration with increasing cycles of freezing and thawing as shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We studied the muscular morphology, which included the measurement of porosities (%) of pore that increased (from 1.4% to 4.3%) and pore distribution, by X-ray computed tomography (uCT). The cycles of the freeze-thaw resulted in structural changes, which seemed to be closely associated with ultimate quality of frozen fish products. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Chunlin Hu; Jing Xie							The effect of multiple freeze-thaw cycles on protein oxidation and quality of Trachurus murphyi.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, we investigated the changes in protein oxidation and quality of Trachurus murphyi due to repeated freezing and thawing (F-T) during refrigerated storage using physicochemical and texture profile analysis. The results showed that protein oxidation occurred through the formation of carbonyl groups and reduction in sulfhydryl content and Ca2+-ATPase activity. The oxidative modifications in myofibrillar protein gels were evaluated using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis that observed along with a decrease in the intensity of the 75, 48, and 35 kDa bands. Color, water migration, and texture profile were used to evaluate the quality of T. murphyi. As shown by the Atomic force microscopy analysis (AFM) results, the length of myofibrils in the sample increased with freeze-thawing from 1.08 m at the second cycle of the freezing and thawing (F-T 2) to 1.54 m at the eighth cycle of the freezing and thawing (F-T 8), whereas the height of myofibrils decreased from 111.8 to 74.87 nm. Raman spectroscopy further revealed that the alpha-helix content was reduced, along with the contents of beta-turns, beta-sheets, and random coils of myofibrillar protein with increasing freeze-thaw cycles. These results indicated that multiple freezing-thawing decreased T. murphyi quality during refrigerated storage. Practical applications. The study was performed to investigate the effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the protein oxidation and quality of T. murphyi. We provided the method of the evaluation for the oxidation and the quality of freeze and thaw fish, and a theoretical basis for freezing and thawing fish products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15998					FSTA:2022-04-Rc1374
J		Chunling Zhang; Zhiyi Zhao; Gaoji Yang; Yiqi Shi; Yuyu Zhang; Chao Shi; Xiaodong Xia							Effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water on natural Enterobacteriaceae reduction and seed germination in the production of alfalfa sprouts.		Food Microbiology					Microbial contamination of sprouts commonly occurs because of the pathogens present on and in the seeds and the optimal conditions for bacteria growth provided during the germination and sprouting processes. This study examined the decontamination effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW), a "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) disinfectant, in the production process of alfalfa sprouts. SAEW with various available chlorine concentrations (ACC, 25, 35, 45 mg/L) and different pH levels (5.0, 5.7 and 6.4) was used to soak seeds for different length of time (0.5 and 6 h), after which the variations in natural Enterobacteriaceae, water absorption and seed germination (germination rate, weight and length of sprouts) were determined. The results showed that when the seeds were soaked with SAEW, albeit with different ACC (25, 35 and 45 mg/L) and pH levels (5.0, 5.7 and 6.4), a significant reduction of Enterobacteriaceae and no negative effect on sprout quality was observed. The water absorption and germination rates were also not significantly adversely affected by SAEW soaking. These findings suggest that SAEW could be used to decontaminate natural Enterobacteriaceae in the production of alfalfa sprouts, with no negative side effects on the alfalfa seeds.

J		Chunmei Du; Suyu Quan; Xuemei Nan; Yiguang Zhao; Fangquan Shi; Qingyao Luo; Benhai Xiong							Effects of oral milk extracellular vesicles on the gut microbiome and serum metabolome in mice.		Food & Function					Milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) are rich in abundant bioactive macromolecules, such as glycoconjugates, proteins, lipids and nucleic acids, and these vesicles might transmit signals to human consumers. However, it remains to be determined whether milk EVs import new pathogens to humans or are beneficial for human health. Here, C57BL/6 female and male mice were randomly divided into 4 EV dose levels (0,1.5*109 p g-1, 1.0*1010 p g-1 and 1.5*1010 p g-1). Based on the alterations in body weight, the control group (0 p g-1, PBS) and the middle treatment group (1.0*1010 p g-1) were chosen for further analysis of the effects of EVs on the gut microbiota and blood metabolites in mice, by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics, respectively. We found that milk EVs increased the abundance of "beneficial" microbes such as Akkermansia, Muribaculum and Turicibacter, while decreased the level of "harmful" bacteria Desulfovibrio. Serum metabolites showed that EVs mainly changed the lipid and amino acid metabolism, and especially increased several serum anti-inflammatory factors, which might be beneficial for inflammation and other metabolic diseases. The results of KEGG analysis suggested that the enriched pathways were the intestinal immune network for IgA production, retinol metabolism, and d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism. Taken together, the positive effect of milk EVs on serum nutrient metabolism without promoting "harmful" bacterial colonization in female and male mice may indicate that they are safe bioactive molecules, and some of the changes they induce may provide protection against certain diseases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	21	10938	10949	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02255e					FSTA:2022-03-Pe0843
J		Chunmei Li; Jie Zhou; Ning Yue; Yanli Wang; Jing Wang; Fen Jin							Dissipation and dietary risk assessment of tristyrylphenol ethoxylate homologues in cucumber after field application.		Food Chemistry					The potential for tristyrylphenol ethoxylates (TSPEOs) residues to contaminate crops or be released into the environment is of increasing concern, as they are toxic to living organisms. This study determined the dissipation of TSPEO homologues in cucumber under field conditions. TSPEO n (n=6-29) dissipated more rapidly in cucumber than in soil samples, with half-lives of 1.80-4.30 d and 3.73-6.52 d, respectively. Short-chain TSPEO n (n=6-11) persisted for longer than other oligomers in soil. Concentrations of the final residues (SigmaTSPEOs) in cucumber and soil were 24.3-1349 mug/kg and 47.3-1337 mug/kg, respectively. TSP15EO or TSP16EO was the dominant oligomer, with concentrations of 2.30-150 mug/kg. The risk assessment showed that the acute and chronic dietary exposure risks of SigmaTSPEOs in cucumber were 0.03-0.57% and 0.05-0.39%, respectively, suggesting little or no health risk to Chinese consumers.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Free radical accumulation in the body will cause oxidative stress damages including the renal damage. Schisandrae Sphenantherae Fructus (Schisandra), a traditional Chinese Herbal medicine, has been used throughout the world. Anwulignan, a monomer extracted from Schisandra , has been shown in our previous studies to possess antioxidant and protective effects on the liver, brain and spleen damages in the aging mice. However, its effect on the renal damage caused by aging is not clear. This study showed that anwulignan could significantly increase the kidney index, the creatinine clearance, the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase; reduce the urinary protein concentration, the serum urea nitrogen and creatinine content, the content of malondialdehyde and 8-hydroxylated deoxyguanosine in the renal tissue; and improve the renal tissue damage. Moreover, anwulignan increased the production of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 proteins and decreased the production level of Keap1 protein in the renal tissue in the d-galactose induced aging mice. These results suggest that anwulignan significantly alleviates the renal damage by its antioxidant effect through regulating the production of Nrf2/ARE pathway-related proteins in the renal tissue in the d-galactose induced aging mice. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	8	1097	1105	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00951-7					FSTA:2021-12-Aj17384

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Fructus Gardeniae (FG) is medicine food widely used for the treatment and prevention of various diseases. However, in recent years, research has suggested that high doses of FG can cause hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. To assess this potential toxicity in more depth, this study investigated the effects of decocted FG and two of its bioactive constituents (geniposide and genipin) on liver and kidney function in rats. Rats were intragastrically administered FG (330 mg/kg body weight), geniposide (50 mg/kg body weight), or genipin (50 mg/kg body weight) for 12 weeks. Changes in body weight, liver and kidney indices, biochemical indices, and inflammatory factors were monitored. In addition, pathological sections were assessed and the expression of caspase-3, NF-kappaBp65, COX-2, and iNOS was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. It was found that the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, creatinine, and urea nitrogen increased following administration of FG, geniposide, and genipin. Furthermore, the activities of superoxide dismutase and reduced glutathione decreased following treatment, while malondialdehyde levels increased. Pathological and immunohistochemical evaluations further confirmed that FG and its constituents may cause damage to the liver and kidneys. The mechanism study revealed that the protein level of inflammatory pathway increased and further promoted apoptosis, suggesting that it should not be taken orally for extended periods of time. Practical applications. Chinese medicine and food safety have always been public health concerns. Fructus Gardeniae (FG) is a plant with a dual-purpose as it is used as both a medicine and food. Medicinally, it has the effects of heat-clearing and detoxification. However, its adverse effects and related mechanisms are not clear, and this has potential safety implications. In this study, rats were treated with FG for 12 weeks and found that the long-term administration of FG or high dosing can lead to damage to liver and kidney function. Therefore, close attention must be paid to the dosage of FG in order to achieve a therapeutic effect and avoid adverse reactions. Thus, this study lays a foundation for the safety evaluation and clinical application of FG. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13752					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14622

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To enhance the quality or, in other words, increase the variety of horseradish sauce, two-step fermentation using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae is proposed for the production of the sauce. Total phenolics, acids and amino acid nitrogen contents were determined and used to assess the fermentation efficiency, while antioxidant activities, profiles of amino acids and volatile flavor compounds was used to indicate the quality of the sauce. Molecular structure determination as well as electronic tongue and sensory analyses were also conducted. Adding S. cerevisiae after 48 h of LAB fermentation resulted in higher fermentation efficiency. The sauce was noted to be fermented more fully, with increased content of amino acids by 23.10% compared with unfermented samples; its DPPH radical scavenging ability and reducing power increased by 26.26% and 33.33%, respectively. The contents of alcohols, esters and acids increased in the sauce. The electronic tongue and sensory evaluation showed that the sauce had good sensory quality.

Food & Function					This study investigated lipid metabolism regulation by anthocyanins from Aronia melanocarpa (AAM) in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and high fat diet (HFD) mice. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography/ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis identified the constituents of AAM, which decreased lipid content and inflammation in 3T3-L1 cells without cytotoxicity. Meanwhile, taking normal diet and orlistat mice as references, AAM supplementation improved blood lipid levels and adipocyte degeneration, promoted beneficial gut microbial growth, and maintained lipid metabolism in HFD mice. Furthermore, AAM activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway, accompanied by the regulation of adipogenic transcription factors and their target genes in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, our data demonstrated that AAM exhibits anti-adipogenic activities that were partially mediated by the AMPK pathway and gut microbiota regulation. This study provides new insight into the regulation of lipid metabolism by AAM and suggests that AAM has potential therapeutic effects on hyperlipidemia. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	14	6254	6270	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00907a					FSTA:2021-11-Jg15131

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The mechanism of nanoselenium (nano-Se) improving the resistance induced by plant components to aphids is unclear. In this study, foliar sprayed nano-Se (5.0 mg/L) could significantly reduce the Sitobion avenae number (36%) compared with that in the control. Foliar application of nano-Se enhanced the antioxidant capacity by reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) and increasing GSH-Px, CAT, GSH, Pro, and VE concentrations in wheat seedlings. The phenylpropane pathway was activated by nano-Se biofortification, which increased apigenin and caffeic acid concentrations. The high-level expression of the related genes (TaBx1A, TaBx3A, TaBx4A, TaASMT2, and TaCOMT) induced the promotion of melatonin (88.6%) and 2,4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA) (64.3%). Different ratios of the secondary metabolites to nano-Se were taken to examine the effects on resistance of wheat to S. avenae. The results revealed that the combination of nano-Se and melatonin could achieve the best overall performance by reducing the S. avenae number by 52.2%. The study suggests that the coordinated applications of nano-Se and melatonin could more effectively improve the wheat resistance to aphids via the promotion of volatile organic compound synthesis and modulation in phenylpropane and indole metabolism pathways.										2021	69	47	14103	14114	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05617					FSTA:2022-04-Mj1885

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Experimental and simulated approaches combining an ohmic heating (OH) process and an external heating system for the pasteurization of liquid egg whites, yolks, and whole eggs were evaluated in this study. 3D computer simulation models were developed for each approach using COMSOL Multiphysics 5.6 to visualize the temperature and distribution of degrees of pasteurization at several cross sections. From both the hot and cold spots of the samples, the temperature, thermal protein non-denaturation ratio (X), and pasteurization profiles were estimated. Color changes were also evaluated using a computer vision system (CVS). The heating conditions were optimized according to a high constant X value, a low total color difference value (DeltaE< 3), and certain pasteurization standards for each sample. OH treatment combined with concurrent external heating approaches reduced the process time and prevented local overheating. These results are of potential value for the design of ohmic pasteurization systems for liquid eggs.

J		Chunsen Wu; Guiying Ji; Fan Gao; Jian-Ya Qian; Liang Zhang; Qian Li; Chen Zhang							Effect of heat-moisture treatment on the structural and physicochemical characteristics of sand rice (Agriophyllum squarrosum) starch.		Food Science & Nutrition					A small granule starch from sand rice (Agriophyllum squarrosum) was subjected to heat-moisture treatment (HMT) at different moisture contents (MCs, 15%-30%). With MC ≤ 20%, a higher MC resulted in increases in the starch orders (i.e., short-range and crystalline structure) with unchanged granule morphology. Nonetheless, a further elevated MC (>20%) gradually destroyed the granule morphology and starch orders. Also, HMT gradually vanished the lamellar structure as MC increased during HMT. These structural evolutions in HMT-modified starch resulted in greater thermal stability, higher pasting temperature, lower pasting viscosity and weakened digestibility. Particularly, HMT applied directly in sand rice starch at 20% MC obtained the highest amount of SDS and RS (23.6%), which was 2.2-fold higher than that of native starch. Therefore, the small granule sand rice starch can be modulated by HMT through controlled MC to expand their application range in food production. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Research International					Amine-negative lactic acid bacteria can prevent excess biogenic amines from accumulating in sausage. In this study, the amine-negative Pediococcus pentosaceus 30-7 and 30-15 with good fermentation properties and biogenic amine removal ability were isolated for tilapia sausage production. P. pentosaceus 30-7 improved the physical characteristics such as gel strength and hardness in tilapia sausage, while P. pentosaceus 30-15 significantly enhanced the contents of umami and sweet free amino acids. The microbial metabolic network revealed that the dominant microbial community in the fermentation process including Pediococcus and Lactococcus contributed to the physicochemical formation of sausage. The significant decrease of biogenic amine contents after addition of P. pentosaceus strains mainly resulted from their ability to remove biogenic amines and to inhibit the growth of amine-producing Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Streptococcus. This study provides an effective method for directionally improving the physicochemical properties and safety in fermented tilapia sausage.

J		Chunsheng Liu; Weizhi Ji; Hongzhen Jiang; Yaohua Shi; Li He; Zhifeng Gu; Shuntao Zhu							Comparison of biochemical composition and non-volatile taste active compounds in raw, high hydrostatic pressure-treated and steamed oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis.		Food Chemistry					In this study, the effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and steam on biochemical composition and non-volatile taste active compounds of oysters Crassostrea hongkongensis were investigated. The moisture content in steamed oysters significantly decreased when compared to raw samples, subsequently their crude protein, crude lipid, glycogen and ash contents (% wet weight) were all increased (P < 0.05). In addition, though the moisture content in HHP oysters decreased, no significant differences were observed in proximate compositions compared to raw oysters, except crude protein. There were no significant differences in saturated fatty acids (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) profiles between raw and HHP oysters, however, C20:3n6 content in HHP oysters was significantly higher than that in raw samples (P< 0.05). The PUFA profile of steamed oysters, mostly contributed by n-3 PUFA, was significantly higher than that of both raw and HHP samples (P< 0.05). Major free amino acids (FAA) (taste activity value, TAV > 1) in oysters with three treatments were alanine, glycine, glutamic acid and histidine, and their contents were significantly higher in raw and HHP groups than that in steamed group. The 5′-inosine monophosphate (IMP) and 5′-guanosine monophosphate (GMP) in HHP and steamed oysters decreased compared to raw samples, while AMP content in steam oysters were significantly increased (P< 0.05). The equivalent umami concentration (EUC) of oysters of raw, HHP and steamed groups were 8.80,3.66 and 1.44 g MSG/100 g, respectively, with significant differences observed among different treatments (P< 0.05). Succinic acid was the major organic acid in raw and HHP oysters, while lactic acid was the major organic acid in steamed groups. Further, Na+, K+, PO43- and Cl- were the main inorganic ions (TAV > 1), and their contents were significantly higher in raw and HHP groups than that in steamed group (P< 0.05). This study demonstrated that HHP treatment slightly influenced the changes in the biochemical composition and non-volatile taste active compounds to raw oysters, compared to steamed process.

Food Bioscience					Catechins are important to evaluate the quality of black tea. In this study, a quantitative prediction model was established based on the measurement of electrical properties and a chemometrics method to detect the catechin content in fermented black tea. The effects of different preprocessing, variable screening methods, and nonlinear algorithms on the model were studied. Results show that the electrical parameters most sensitive to catechin content are equivalent parallel capacitance, loss factor, and reactance mainly at low frequencies (0.05-0.1 kHz). Normalization processing (Zscore), variable combinations' population analysis and the iterative retained information variable algorithm (VCPA-IRIV), and the nonlinear intelligent algorithm random forest (RF) can all effectively improve the performance of a catechin prediction model. In the VCPA-IRIV-RF model, the number of introduced variables was reduced from 162 to 9 with a compression ratio of 94.5%; the root mean square error of prediction and the root mean square error of validation of this model were only 0.269 and 0.214, respectively. The predictive correlation coefficient, correlation coefficient of calibration, and residual predictive deviation increased to 0.988, 0.994, and 5.47, respectively, indicating the good performance of the model. The rapid and nondestructive determination of catechin content in black tea fermentation using a method to detect the electrical properties seems to be practical.

Journal of Food Safety					The aim of this study was to develop a portable electronic nose (e-nose) system for the rapid and convenient detection of saponin in submerged fermentation of Tremella aurantialba (T. aurantialba) in situ. The system was built using hardware and software systems. The hardware system consisted of a gas path module and a circuit module, and the software framework provided a friendly human-computer interface and multivariate computational tools. Subsequently, the e-nose system was used to detect off-gas in fermentation tanks every 12hr in situ. Saponin content was simultaneously determined by the traditional measurement method. On the basis of odor data from the e-nose, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to establish a quantitative model for the prediction of saponin content. For the PLSR model, the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) was 0.2247 and the correlation coefficients of prediction (Rp) were 96.76% in the prediction set. These results showed that the feasibility of the device designed to detect the fermentation degree of the process and proved to be a valuable tool for real-time and in-situ detection of the fermentation process of T. aurantialba. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	4			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12902					FSTA:2021-12-Jq16247
J		Chunxia Su; Meeren, P. van der; Meulenaer, B. de							Development of a GC-FID method for the quantitative determination of polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) in foods.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) is a powerful lipophilic emulsifier used in low-fat spreads and chocolate. It should be used at the lowest level at which the desired technological effect is achieved, not exceeding the specified maxima according to Annexe II to Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. A gas chromatography-flame ionisation detection (GC-FID) method was developed for quantification of PGPR. This method is based on estimating the content of ricinoleic acid using 12-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid as an internal standard, from which the PGPR concentration was deduced. The method involved saponification, methylation, a two-step solid phase extraction (SPE) separation of the fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs), silylation, and GC-FID analysis. The limits of detection and quantification of ricinoleic acid were 2.2 and 6.7 mug/mL, respectively, at 0.1 L injection volume. Considering the average content of ricinoleic acid in PGPR (i.e. 86.63 2.0 wt%) and the amount of food product that is used in the proposed protocol (i.e. 20 mg), this resulted in a LOD and LOQ of 0.76 and 2.32 mug PGPR per mg of food product, respectively. The developed method was validated by determining PGPR recovery from a high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) solution, from chocolate spiked with a commercially available PGPR, and from commercially available low fat spreads with a known PGPR content. The actual recovery was more than 95% for all matrices, indicating the accuracy of the developed analytical technique. Moreover, the method proved to be very reproducible, with RSD < 4% for concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5 wt%. The results showed that our proposed GC-FID method enables the reliable and quantitative determination of the PGPR concentration in commercial food products with various fat contents. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	11	1853	1866	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1951850					FSTA:2022-03-Ka0125

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. As an edible and medicinal herb in Chinese folk medicine, Cyclocarya paliurus (Batal.) Iljinskaja leaves are traditionally widely used in the treatment of metabolic disorders. The vegetable Momordica charantia L. has been consumed worldwide for thousands of years as a traditional drug due to its activities against obesity and diabetes. In view of the therapeutic value of Momordica saponins (MSs) and C. paliurus polysaccharides (CPPs), an independently developed MSs-and CPPs-containing beverage (MC) was evaluated for its efficacy in controlling oxidative stress and obesity in Caenorhabditis elegans. Results. First, we found that MC could promote the nuclear localization of DAF-16 and the translation of SOD-3. Further exploring its antioxidant properties, the oxidative stress by-products reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, and nonesterified fatty acids were significantly inhibited in C. elegans. Moreover, damage due to diseases related to oxidative stress (age pigments and neurodegenerative diseases) was alleviated. Furthermore, fat accumulation was significantly reduced in normal and high-fat models. Finally, the lipid-lowering effects of MC might involve reductions in the size and number of lipid droplets without impairing basic physiological functions in C. elegans. Conclusion. These results provide promising data indicating MC as an innovative health beverage for the pharmacological management of oxidative stress and obesity. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	8	3366	3375	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10966					FSTA:2021-09-Jq11967

Journal of Food Process Engineering					The main purpose of this work was to use the sodium alginate gel (NaAlg) to explore the influencing factors of 3D food printing of large-particle heterogeneous food materials. For edible rose petals, the main factors limiting the application of roses to 3D printing are the material's non-shear thinning characteristics, the roses being much larger in size than the nozzle diameter, and the poor stability of anthocyanins. NaAlg gel as a model system to help roses to realize 3D printing was applied. The edible rose petals needed to be color-protected due to the high moisture content of alginate. The results showed that 1% wt. /vol. Chitosan treatment had the best color protection effect. In addition, the effect of sizes (<0.2,0.2-0.5,0.5-1.2 cm) and amount of rose petal pieces (1,3, and 6% wt. /wt.) on 3D printing behavior of heterogeneous materials were investigated. Results. Indicated that rose petals with a plane diameter of less than 0.5 cm and an addition of less than 6% wt. /wt. Can be successfully printed to exquisite shaped rich rose-fragrance products. Practical Applications. 3D printing of roses combining with sodium alginate could produce a new type of snack food. The application of roses provides the basis for the development of heterogeneous systems for 3D food printing. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13583					FSTA:2021-04-Aj6682

Moreover, the relationship between protein and the noodles made from wheat and germinated barley flour was evaluated. It was found that germination affected the protein properties, and the protein properties were correlated with the properties of noodles. The content of beta-sheet in protein was first increased and then decreased with germination time increased, and the protein had larger emulsification and foaming properties. Besides, the protein isolated from hot air-dried germinated barley had higher gelatinisation enthalpy and secondary structure content. Furthermore, the wheat and germinated barley mixed noodles had increased elasticity and cohesiveness and reduced viscosity and water absorption. The hardness of noodles showed was positively correlated with water absorption capacity, and the extensibility of cooked noodles was positively correlated with the foaming capacity of proteins. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	11	5589	5600	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15107					FSTA:2022-03-Mq1136

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Oxidized phlorotannin can be used as a protein crosslinking agent to produce high-quality fish gel products. Phlorotannin can be easily induced to form quinone compounds in an oxidizing environment, while o-quinone has been proven to be a reactive, electrophilic intermediate that easily reacts with proteins to form rigid molecular crosslinking networks. The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic effects of ultraviolet A (UVA) irradiation (1 h, 15 Wm-2) and various concentrations of Laminaria japonica phlorotannin extracts (PTE) on the gel properties of grass carp myofibrillar protein (MP). Results. UVA treatment and PTE could synergistically improve the MP gel properties more than PTE alone (P< 0.05). At 625 mmolkg-1 MP PTE alone, the gel strength and cooking yield reached 3.10 0.16 gcm and 47.45 0.35%, respectively, while with the same level of PTE plus UVA they became 4.26 0.19 gcm and 53.89 1.54%, respectively. The three-dimensional network structure of the gel (with PTE + UVA) showed higher connectivity and tightness than that of the control group (no treatment). Conclusions. The synergistic effects of PTE and UVA could effectively induce crosslinking of grass carp MP, which could lead to an improvement of MP gel quality. These findings would provide a new technical approach to produce high-quality protein gel products in the fish processing industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	7	2659	2667	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10890					FSTA:2021-08-Rc2769

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Whey protein-based nanocomplexes were fabricated to improve the stability and bioavailability of marine carotenoid-fucoxanthin (FX) by using whey protein isolate (WPI) as the core and Ca2+ crosslinked flaxseed gum (FG) as the shell. The results of multi-spectroscopic methods indicated that the incorporation of FX and FG changed the structural characteristics of WPI. FX could quench the intrinsic fluorescence of WPI by a static mechanism, indicating that they could spontaneously form a nanocomplex through non-covalent interactions. FX-WPI-FG-Ca nanocomplex with a nano scale (~350 nm) was found to perform the best with the highest encapsulation efficiency (EE, 96.19 0.33%) and loading capacity (LC, 2.47 0.04%) and improved FX stability against ultraviolet B (UVB), heat, NaCl and pH. In addition, the nanocomplex was shown to effectively deliver FX into PC12, and cytotoxicity increased with the concentration. The encapsulated-FX perturbed lipid metabolism, causing ROS accumulation, mitochondrial damage and regulated apoptosis. In conclusion, the nanocomplexes assembled from WPI and FG may be effective encapsulation systems for FX, which could potentially become a new dietary supplement for cancer patients.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					To investigate the effect of cooking temperature (55, 65, 75, 85 and 95 °C) on texture and flavour binding of braised sauce porcine skin (BSPS), sensory acceptance, microstructure and flavour-binding capacity were investigated during the processing of BSPS. Samples cooked at 85 and 95 °C showed better texture and aroma scores. Hardness and chewiness of BSPS were obviously improved at 85 and 95 °C than control group. Collagen structure was significantly destroyed over 85 °C. The porcine skin collagen heated at 85 and 95 °C showed relatively higher flavour-binding capacity than other samples. The improvement of texture of BSPS was mainly attributed to the degradation of collagen. Higher aroma scores of BSPS were related to intense binding abilities with aroma compounds at 85 and 95 °C.

C.; Baoshan Xing							Food-grade titanium dioxide particles decreased the bioaccessibility of vitamin D3 in the simulated human gastrointestinal tract.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Food-grade titanium dioxide (E171) particles, as a "whiteness" additive, are often co-ingested with lipid-rich foods. Therefore, we explored the impact of E171 on lipid digestion and vitamin D3 (VD3) bioaccessibility encapsulated within oil-in-water emulsions in a simulated human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) model. VD3 bioaccessibility significantly decreased from 80 to 74% when raising E171 from 0 to 0.5 wt%. The extent of lipid digestion was reduced by E171 addition in a dose-dependent manner. VD3 bioaccessibility was positively correlated with the final amount of free fatty acids (FFAs) produced by lipid digestion (R2=0.95), suggesting that the reduction in VD3 bioaccessibility was due to the inhibition of lipid digestion by E171. Further experiments showed that E171 interacted with lipase and calcium ions, thereby interfering with lipid digestion. The findings of this study enhance our understanding toward the potential impact of E171 on the nutritional attributes of foods for human digestion health.										2021	69	9	2855	2863	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06644					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10821

Food Chemistry					In this study, heavy metals including Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Cd in 55 Thai local rice (4 varieties) were measured using ICP-MS. Health risks were estimated from various Thai population groups, classified according to ages and genders. The potential impact on Thai population who consumed Thai local rice contained heavy metals was assessed by means of probabilistic approach. The hazard quotient (HQ) for non-carcinogenic risks from heavy metal exposure was below the threshold limit of 1 for all rice varieties except Mn in Pka Am Pun rice and As in Pka Am Pun rice, Jek Chuey Sao Hai rice, and Leb Nok rice. Only the hazard index (HI) for consumption of Khaowong Kalasin sticky rice was below 1. The maximum cancer probabilities over the lifetime consumption of Thai local rice were in the range of 5 in 10,000 to 3 in 1000 chances in developing cancer.

J		Chunying Meng; Kuiwu Wang; Xiaojun Zhang; Xinyue Zhu							Purification and structure analysis of zinc-binding protein from Mizuhopecten yessoensis.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Zn-binding protein was obtained after purification from scallops (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) using gel permeation and ion-exchange chromatography. Amino acid determination showed that the cysteine of the zinc-binding protein accounted for one-third of the total amino acids, which is a typical feature of metallothionein (MT). The spectra of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) were analyzed to predict the secondary structure information of zinc-binding protein: the alpha-helix was 46.55%, the beta-sheets was 27.07%, the random coil was 16.48%, and the beta-turns was 9.89%. Using a commercial kit to measure its antioxidant activity in vitro, the result showed that it had good scavenging ability to 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), hydroxyl radical (.OH), and reducing the ability to ferrous iron ions. With the process provided by this study, zinc-binding protein can be prepared in large quantities, which is the basis for its future commercialization. Practical applications. According to the extraction and purification process established in this study, a large amount of zinc-bound MT from the viscera of scallops can be obtained. And the zinc-bound MT had good antioxidant activity. In addition, the yield of each purification step has been calculated. The zinc-bound MTs from scallop" viscera can be prepared in large quantities by directly using the process in this manuscript or by equal magnification of this process. In the future, large-scale production can be considered to increase the economic value of scallops" viscera. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13756					FSTA:2021-10-Re3538

Food & Function					The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of lycopene supplementation on lipid metabolism in rats and their offspring. The experiment was conducted on 60 female rats divided into four groups: normal diet, normal diet with 200 mg kg-1 lycopene, high-fat diet, and high-fat diet with 200 mg kg-1 lycopene. The plasma levels of TG, LDL-C, AST and ALT in female rats fed a high-fat diet were significantly increased (P< 0.05). Lycopene supplementation reduced the plasma TG, LEP and AST levels (P< 0.05). In addition, the activity of ACC and mRNA expression of SREBP1c, FAS, PPARgamma, CPT1, HMGCR, ACC, PLIN1 and FATP1 in the liver were also increased after feeding a high-fat diet (P< 0.05), whereas the expression of HSL was decreased (P< 0.05). Lycopene increased the activity of HSL and the expression of ATGL in the liver (P< 0.05), and the activity of ACC and mRNA expression of HMGCR and ACC were decreased (P< 0.05). For the offspring, maternal feeding of a high-fat diet reduced the plasma HDL-C levels (P< 0.05), but lycopene supplementation reduced the plasma TC levels (P< 0.05). Maternal high-fat diet also decreased the activity of HSL and the expression of CD36, PLIN1 and FATP1 in the liver while increasing the expression of PPARgamma (P< 0.05). Maternal lycopene supplementation decreased the activities of ACC and FAS in the liver and decreased the expression of PPARgamma, ACC and PLIN1 (P< 0.05). Maternal feeding of a high-fat diet increased the level of oxidative stress in the liver, the level of blood lipids in plasma and the rate of lipid production in the liver of rats and their offspring. Maternal lycopene supplementation can reduce the level of oxidative stress in rats and their offspring, reduce the level of blood lipids in plasma, and also reduce the rate of lipid production in the liver of rats and offspring. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	19	8960	8975	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01039e					FSTA:2022-01-Aj1216

Gaertn. polysaccharide induced by calcium hydroxide: a novel potential pectin source.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, a novel gelling polysaccharide with a yield of ~6.7% (dry basis) was obtained from Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. seeds, and subsequent structural analysis suggested that Nicandra physalodes (Linn.) Gaertn. polysaccharide (NPGP) was composed of galacturonic acid (87.8%), rhamnose (3.7%), glucose (3.6%), arabinose (1.8%), galactose (1.8%), and a small amount of xylose (1.3%). The weight average molar weight (Mw) and number average molecular weight (Mn) of NPGP were determined as ~ 79.6 kDa and ~23 kDa, respectively. Also, it was found that NPGP had a low methoxylation degree (DM) of ~28%. These results indicate that NPGP can be grouped into the family of low methoxyl pectins (LMP). Subsequently, we further investigated the gelling properties of NPGP, and found that NPGP exhibited varying sensitivities to different types of calcium sources, with Ca (OH)2 being especially effective in inducing NPGP gelation. At a fixed NPGP concentration (0.5%, w/v), an increased amount of Ca (OH)2 addition induced a stronger gel, with the greatest gel hardness being observed at 0.06% (w/v) of Ca (OH)2 concentration. However, further Ca (OH)2 addition decreased the gel hardness. Furthermore, it was also observed that NPGP gels had relatively good heating stability but poor freeze-thawing stability, which could be greatly enhanced by incorporating appropriate amounts of sucrose. Overall, these findings highlight the potential commercial value of developing NPGP as a novel pectin resource.

J		Church, H.; Nagao-Sato, S.; Overcash, F.; Reicks, M.							Associations between seafood intake frequency and diet and health indicators among U.S. adults: NHANES 2011-2016.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Seafood provides nutritional benefits, but is not commonly consumed by most Americans. Regression analyses were used to examine associations between self-reported seafood intake frequency, diet quality and health indicators among U.S. Adults (20-65 years) based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2011-2016) (n = 11,478). A low percentage (14%) consumed seafood ≥8 times/month. The proportion consuming seafood ≥8 times/month was higher among foreign-born compared to U.S.-born adults and those with more education and higher incomes. Individuals consuming seafood intake ≥8 times/month had higher Healthy Eating Index-2015 scores, greater intakes of protein, cholesterol and alcohol, certain vitamins and minerals, most monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, fruits, vegetables and total meat, and lower intakes of carbohydrates, total sugars, saturated fatty acids, dairy, refined grains, and solid fats and added sugars than those consuming seafood <8 times/month. Body mass index, waist circumference, diastolic blood pressure and sedentary time were lower, while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total blood mercury, and blood cadmium and lead were higher among those consuming seafood ≥8 times vs. < 8 times/month. Findings indicate that seafood intake frequency ≥8 times/month was consistent with a healthy diet and lifestyle, yet concerns were noted regarding blood levels of heavy metals.

J		Chuying Chen; Xuan Peng; Jinyin Chen; Zengyu Gan; Chunpeng Wan							Mitigating effects of chitosan coating on postharvest senescence and energy depletion of harvested pummelo fruit response to granulation stress.		Food Chemistry					The effect of chitosan coating exposure on juice sac granulation and energy metabolism in harvested pummelo fruit was investigated. Pummelo fruits were exposed to 1.5% chitosan coating, and then stored at 202 °C for about 150 days. Postharvest chitosan coating treatment apparently alleviated the development of juice sac granulation as well as the increases in weight loss, pulp firmness, cell membrane permeability and cellulose content. The levels of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and energy charge (EC) in the chitosan-coated fruit showed significantly higher levels than those of the respective controls. Meanwhile, the enzymses actively engaged in energy metabolism such as H+-ATPase, Ca2+-ATPase, Mg2+-ATPase, cytochrome C oxidase (CCO), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) were markedly maintained by chitosan coating. Besides, notably high contents of acetyl-CoA, cis-aconitate, succinate, fumarate and oxaloacetate were observed in the chitosan-coated fruit. The results highlighted that chitosan coating could delay postharvest senescence of pummelo fruit by reducing the rate of energy depletion while maintaining higher levels of key metabolites taking part in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle at room temperature storage.

J		Chuying Chen; Zhengpeng Nie; Chunpeng Wan; Zengyu Gan; Jinyin Chen							Suppression on postharvest juice sac granulation and cell wall modification by chitosan treatment in harvested pummelo (Citrus grandis L. Osbeck) stored at room temperature.		Food Chemistry					Deposition of both lignin and cellulose accompanied by juice sac granulation is widespread in harvested citrus fruit. Hence, measures to suppress postharvest granulation of "Majiayou" pummelo is of great importance. The fruit was treated with 1.5% chitosan and then stored at room temperature (202 °C) for 150 d. As compared to the control fruits, chitosan coating significantly suppressed granulation index and maintained good quality. Chitosan coating inhibited lignification by suppressing the activities and expression levels of lignin synthesis-related enzymes (PAL, CAD and POD). By contrast, chitosan treatment enhanced the activities and expression levels of cell wall degrading enzymes, including PME, PG, Cx, XTH and beta-Gal, which might contribute to the decrease in cellulose. In a nutshell, chitosan coating can effectively suppress juice sac granulation and fruit senescence of pummelo fruits, and play a crucial role in maintaining the cell wall modification.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Protein degradation is an integral process of leaf senescence, and this catabolism is strongly associated with proteases in diverse plant species. However, the characterization of proteases as well as their upstream regulators during postharvest senescence, especially in economically important leafy vegetables such as Chinese flowering cabbage, remains to be determined. In this study, temporal and spatial gene expression patterns of eight proteases showed that three of them, namely, BrAPM1, BrASPG2 and BrSAG12, were most up-regulated during postharvest leaf senescence. Their expressions were also significantly induced by senescence-accelerating phytohormones abscisic acid (ABA) and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but were inhibited by senescence-delaying hormones gibberellin (GA3) and cytokinin (6-BA). Importantly, using yeast one-hybrid screening, we identified a Dof (DNA-binding with one finger) transcription factor, BrDof2.4, as the putative binding protein of BrAPM1, BrASPG2 and BrSAG12 promoters. Nucleus-localized BrDof2.4 was senescence-, ABA-and MeJA-repressible, but was GA3-and 6-BA-inducible. Furthermore, gel mobility shift and transient dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that BrDof2.4 suppressed the transcription of BrAPM1, BrASPG2 and BrSAG12, through binding to their promoters. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that BrDof2.4 acts as a potential repressor of postharvest leaf senescence in Chinese flowering cabbage by the direct suppression of protease expression. Our work contributes towards improving the technology for increasing the shelf-life and commercial value of this important leafy vegetable.

High iron bioaccessibility from co-microencapsulated iron/ascorbic acid using chelating polypeptides from brewers' spent grain protein as wall material.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Iron fortification is an important and difficult task since most of the bioavailable iron sources are reactive against food matrix. Microencapsulation technology can prevent iron interaction with food matrix. Co-microencapsulation of iron and ascorbic acid was carried out by spray-drying using a protein concentrate obtained from brewers′ spent grain (BSG-PC) and locust bean gum as chelating wall materials. Microcapsules were formulated using a 22 factorial design. The effect of BSG-PC/wall material (8.6 and 17.2 g protein 100 g-1) and ascorbic acid/iron molar ratio (0.9:1 and 1.8:1) on iron encapsulation yield (FeE), ascorbic acid encapsulation (AAE), iron chelated by wall material (FeC), iron bioaccessibility (FeB), particle size, zeta potential, and surface hydrophobicity of the microcapsules were assessed. Higher level of BSG-PC increased FeB at low ascorbic acid/iron molar ratio due to the high iron-chelating activity of BSG proteins (IC50: 7.91.2 mg mL-1). At low levels of BSG-PC, FeB was promoted by ascorbic acid in a dose response way. A multiple response maximization of FeE, AAE, FeB, and FeC was performed and validated. Optimal microcapsule formula resulted with 29% of FeB after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The optimization procedure allowed obtaining a fortifier with the higher iron bioaccessibility and iron content. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Anti-inflammatory activities of Italian Chestnut and Eucalyptus honeys on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages.		Journal of Functional Foods					The aim of this study was to evaluate for the first time the anti-inflammatory effects of chestnut (Castanea sativa) and Eucalyptus (Eucalyptus occidentalis) honeys collected in Italy on murine RAW 264.7 macrophages stressed with the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Pre-treatment with the two honeys markedly decreased apoptosis and stimulated wound healing in macrophages stressed with LPS, where they also reduced the intracellular levels of ROS and nitrite. Additionally, treatment with LPS decreased the levels of glutathione and suppressed the antioxidant enzyme activities, which were significantly (p< 0.05) increased in the presence of the two honeys, through the modulation of Nrf2 expression; in LPS-stressed macrophages, Chestnut or Eucalyptus honeys protected against inflammation by regulating the main inflammatory biomarkers, including TNF-alpha, IL-10 and iNOS, through the decrease of NF-kappaB expression. Finally, they improved mitochondrial respiration and the main related parameters. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

NMR-based Lavado cocoa chemical characterization and comparison with fermented cocoa varieties: insights on cocoa's anti-amyloidogenic activity.		Food Chemistry					The metabolic profile of Lavado cocoa was characterized for the first time by NMR spectroscopy, then compared with the profiles of fermented and processed varieties, Natural and commercial cocoa. The significant difference in the contents of theobromine and flavanols prompted us to examine the cocoa varieties to seek correlations between these metabolite concentrations and the anti-amyloidogenic activity reported for cocoa in the literature. We combined NMR spectroscopy, preparative reversed-phase (RP) chromatography, atomic force microscopy, in vitro biochemical and cell assays, to investigate and compare the anti-amyloidogenic properties of extracts and fractions enriched in different metabolite classes.

A juicy orange makes for a tastier juice: the neglected role of visual material perception in packaging design.		Food Quality and Preference					Food appearance sets intentions and expectations. When designing packaged food much attention is devoted to packaging elements like color and shape, but less to the characteristics of the images used. To our awareness, no study has yet investigated how the appearance of the food shown on the package affects consumers' preferences. Often, orange juice packages depict an orange. Juiciness being one of the most important parameters to assess oranges' quality, we hypothesized that an orange with a juicier appearance on the package would improve the overall evaluation of the juice. Using image cues found to trigger juiciness perception of oranges depicted in 17th century paintings, we designed four orange juice packages by manipulating the highlights on the pulp (present vs. Absent) and the state of the orange (unpeeled vs. Peeled). In an online experiment, 400 participants, each assigned to one condition, rated expected naturalness, healthiness, quality, sweetness and tastiness of the juice, package attractiveness and willingness to buy. Finally, they rated juiciness of the orange for all four images. A one-way ANOVA showed a significant effect of the highlights on juiciness. A MANOVA showed that the presence of highlights, both in isolation and in interaction with the peeled side, also significantly increased expected quality and tastiness of the juice. The present study shows the importance of material perception and food texture appearance in the imagery of food packaging. We suggest that knowledge from vision science on image features and material perception should be integrated into the process of packaging design.

J		Ciccoritti, R.; Taddei, F.; Gazza, L.; Nocente, F.							Influence of kernel thermal pre-treatments on 5-n-alkylresorcinols, polyphenols and antioxidant activity of durum and einkorn wheat.		European Food Research and Technology					Nowadays by-products and waste originated from agro-food processes are considered a source of bioactive molecules. The recovery of the greatest amount of these compounds using advantageous processes is important from an economic perspective. In this work, three different thermal pre-treatments, i.e. hydrothermal, hot air-drying (at three different temperatures) and freeze drying, were applied on intact kernels of durum and einkorn wheat to investigate their effects on the recovery and on the homologue chains composition of alkylresorcinols (AR), on total soluble phenolic (TSP) compounds and on total antioxidant capacity (TAC). The results of this preliminary study showed that thermal processing generally improved AR extractability and caused changes in AR homologue composition, whereas a decrease in TSP content was observed in both wheat species. TAC was not affected by the treatments, suggesting that other antioxidant compounds besides TSP contribute to the total antioxidant capacity of wheat. These findings indicate that just modulating the physical parameters of the thermal pre-processes, it could be possible to promote the recovery of specific bioactive compounds most involved in the biological activities. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Cicek, S. S.; Esposito, T.; Girreser, U.							Prediction of the sweetening effect of Siraitia grosvenorii (luo han guo) fruits by two-dimensional quantitative NMR.		Food Chemistry					During the last decade, dried fruits of Siraitia grosvenorii (luo han guo), also known as monk fruit, have become popular food ingredients. Luo han guo extracts, which are promoted as non-caloric natural sweeteners, are now incorporated into dietary supplements, soft drinks, and energy shakes. The compounds responsible for the sweetening effect are glycosylated cucurbitane-type triterpenoids, the so-called mogrosides. However, of the more than 40 known mogroside compounds, only 11-alpha-hydroxy-mogrosides exhibit a sweetening effect, whereas the other triterpenoids are non-or bitter-tasting. We have used two-dimensional quantitative NMR to determine selectively the content of 11-alpha-hydroxy-mogrosides in these dried fruits and thus to predict their sweetening potential. Homonuclear (H, H COSY) and heteronuclear (HSQC) methods were developed, validated, and compared. Both techniques were found suitable for the quality control of luo han guo fruits and extracts, the COSY experiment being advantageous with regard to accuracy, precision, and limit of quantification.

J		Cichonska, P.; Pudlo, E.; Wojtczak, A.; Ziarno, M.							Effect of the addition of whole and milled flaxseed on the quality characteristics of yogurt.		Foods					The present study aimed to analyze the effect of the addition of whole and milled flaxseed on the quality characteristics of yogurt. In the first stage of the research, the optimal dose of flaxseed was determined. In the second stage of the research, it was assessed whether the selected qualities of yogurt were affected by the form of flaxseed (whole or milled) and the time of addition (before or after fermentation). The yogurts obtained were stored at 5°C for 21 days, and the changes in active acidity, apparent viscosity, syneresis, and the number of yogurt bacteria were determined. The results of the second stage of the study were subjected to two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) (p< 0.05). The study showed that the addition of milled flaxseed to yogurts in the amount of 1% was optimal. Time and form of flaxseed supplementation significantly influenced the changes in active acidity, apparent viscosity, and syneresis in the tested yogurts. The addition of flaxseed did not significantly change the content of yogurt bacteria. The results indicate that to achieve increased apparent viscosity and reduced syneresis, it is more advantageous to use milled flaxseed rather than whole flaxseed. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Due to the particularity of origin area, the yield and price of Tibetan chicken are different from those in the plain areas, which leads to chickens from the plains being disguised as Tibetan chickens. In present study, Tibetan chicken and chicken from other four provinces in plain areas were distinguished by stable isotopes and chemometric methods. The cross-validation rate was 97.6%. Secondly, correlation between mean delta13C, delta15N, delta2H and delta18O values in chicken samples and environmental parameters was investigated. These indicators are closely related to geographical environment. delta13C and delta15N values were positively correlated with longitude (R = 0.955) and altitude (R = 0.796), respectively. delta18O and delta2H values were negatively correlated with latitude (R = 0.903) and altitude (R = 0.938), respectively. At last, we used stable isotopes to trace Tibetan chicken from the different area of Tibet. When four stable isotope ratios were combined, we can distinguish them.

J		Cieciura-Wloch, W.; Borowski, S.; Otlewska, A.							Biohydrogen production from fruit and vegetable waste, sugar beet pulp and corn silage via dark fermentation.		International Sugar Journal					Dark fermentative hydrogen production was investigated using sugar beet pulp (SBP), fruit and vegetable waste (FWV) and corn silage (CS). The highest hydrogen yield of 52 cm3/gVS was achieved for FVW treated at an organic loading rate (OLR) of 17 gVS/m3.d. The hydrogen production from hydrolyzed SBP varied from 17 to 37 cm3/gVS, however the dark fermentation (DF) process was unstable due to the large amounts of lactic acid secreted by lactic acid bacteria. Moreover, in the final stage of the digester operation with SBP, a noticeable methane production of 5 cm3/ gVS was observed. The production of hydrogen from com silage was relatively low (24-27 cm3/gVS) due to operating problems and small sugar content of 7.69 g/l in this substrate. Microbiological analyses revealed the prevalence of lactic acid producing bacteria dominated by Lactobacillaceae, Coriobacteriaceaeand Bifidobacteriaceaeat a family level, which constituted as much as 40-60% of all detected microbes. The main hydrogen-producing bacteria were affiliated with the families Mogibacteriaceaeand Ruminococcaceae. However, the most important finding was the activity of methanogens, which could grow at pH below 6 and produce methane thus lowering hydrogen yield, which was particularly visible in SBP experiments.										2021	123	1466	135	136	0020-8841				10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.085					FSTA:2021-07-Bi1157

Acrylamide and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in thermally treated non-wheat flours and respective breads.		Food Chemistry					This is the first report about the influence of dry and wet heat treatment on acrylamide content in flours and, subsequently, in breads. It was shown that during production of some breads acrylamide content decreases. Dry heating of non-wheat flour resulted in acrylamide in flours of sorghum (160 g/kg); millet (447 g/kg); barley (516 g/kg); triticale (868 g/kg); rye (1833 g/kg); oat (1951 g/kg). Hydrothermal heating had a negligible impact on acrylamide formation. In breads made from flour blends consisted of 70% of dry thermally and 30% of hydrothermally treated flours of millet, sorghum, oat, and rye, respectively, acrylamide was detected in the range from 105 to 312 g/kg. 5-hydroxymethylfurfural probably contributing to acrylamide formation in bread was detected in the range from 2.0 mg/kg to 44.3 mg/kg in dry heated flours; in hydrothermally treated flours was below LOQ (1.7 mg/kg); in breads was between 3.3 and 8.0 mg/kg.

The concentration-modified physicochemical surface properties of sodium carbonate-soluble pectin from pears (Pyrus communis L.).		Food Hydrocolloids					Cross-linking and gelation are important abilities affecting pectin functionality. Pectin concentration, pH and the composition of the dispersing medium play a crucial role in gel formation. The self-assembly of pectin in solution occurs simultaneously with changes in its physicochemical properties. However, this process has not been described in detail to date. Therefore, the effect of pectin concentration on such properties as its surface electrical charge (Q), hydrogen ions binding (betaH+) and total counterions binding (betatotal) during intermolecular interactions in different media was studied. Low-methoxyl diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) extracted from pear fruits by using sodium carbonate was examined. Investigations were performed on a wide range of its content (1.84.10-4-1.84.100% w/v) in water and salt (NaCl and CaCl2) solutions with the ionic strength of 30 mM at 20 °C. Back Dynamic Light Scattering, Laser Doppler Electrophoresis, potentiometry and Atomic Force Microscopy methods were used. The DASP dissociation constant was calculated and used for determination of other physicochemical parameters. The relationship between changes in the physical and physicochemical properties of DASP during gelation was shown. An increase in the relative mean hydrodynamic diameter with DASP concentration was connected with the self-assembling (CaCl2) and cross-linking (water, NaCl) processes leading to gel formation. Simultaneously, the Q value decreased, betaH+, betatotal and the contribution of betaH+ to betatotal increased up to the obtained constant values at the gel state. Thus, the physicochemical properties of pectin may be indicators of the particular stages of macromolecules interactions occurring during gelation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cieslewicz, J.; Koziara, Z.; Cwiklinska, W.; Bartoszek, A.							The toolbox of methods for multidirectional characterization of dietary nucleic acids; verification for raw and processed food products.		Food Analytical Methods					Currently, the nutritional value of food is associated mainly with components such as proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids. However, another important macromolecules present in many foods are dietary nucleic acids (dietNA), i.e., DNA as well as both coding and non-coding RNAs. In the context of food chemistry and nutrition, dietNA are nowadays vastly neglected. In consequence, there are no dedicated methodologies to characterize dietNA. In this study, using raw or processed meat and plant products as model foodstuffs, we developed a toolbox of methods borrowed from other fields (histology, toxicology, molecular biology) that enable the initial characterization of dietNA as a necessary step on the way to systematic evaluation of their nutritional role. The proposed set of methods embraces (i) paraffin embedding of food samples and their staining to visualize the distribution and variety of dietNA in situ; (ii) comet assay to assess integrity of nuclear DNA with possible detection of DNA damage; (iii) dietNA isolation with and without RNAse digestion to determine the content of both DNA and RNA; (iv) electrophoretic separation of isolates to profile dietNA fragments. Such a combined methodological approach revealed clear differences between dietNA derived from raw and processed food products. We believe that the presented set of methods will encourage the broader research on dietNA to understand their role as a nutritionally relevant food component. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Food & Function					Gastrectomy is the main treatment for gastric cancer (GC) at present. Surgery improves the survival rate of patients, but the complications seriously affect the recovery and lack effective treatment measures. In the present study, probiotic compounds (4 strains; Lactobacillus plantarum MH-301 (CGMCC NO. 18618), L. rhamnosus LGG-18 (CGMCC NO. 14007), L. acidophilus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. Lactis LPL-RH (CGMCC NO. 4599)), through clinical and animal model verification, were studied to try to find the auxiliary treatment measures after gastrectomy, and explore its potential mechanism. Clinical research results showed that probiotic compounds treatment could significantly lower postoperative inflammation, enhance immunity, resume gut microbiota composition and promote postoperative recovery. The results in rat models indicated that gastrostomy led to the aggravation of inflammation, the impairment of immunity and intestinal barrier, and the disorder of gut microbiota in vivo. Furthermore, probiotic compounds' administration could downregulate the inflammatory and permeability signaling pathways in the intestinal tissue, reduce the levels of proinflammatory factors, maintain the intestinal mucosal barrier and immune function, and recover the disorder of gut microbiota after gastrectomy in rats. Therefore, we conclude that probiotic compounds can restore gut microbiota homeostasis, reduce inflammation, maintain intestinal mucosal barrier and immunity, finally promote recovery after gastrectomy, and is expected to improve the prognosis of patients. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	14	6294	6308	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01375k					FSTA:2021-11-Ad16162
J		Cijian Zhang; Guohou Sun; Jian Li; Lijuan Wang							A green strategy for maintaining intelligent response and improving antioxidant properties of kappa-carrageenan-based film via cork bark extractive addition.		Food Hydrocolloids					A multifunctional intelligent film was acquired by casting and drying a mixed solution of kappa-carrageenan and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with Prunus maackii pomace extract (EPM) as the natural pH indicator and cork bark extract (CBE) as the antibacterial agent. The film morphology and structure were evaluated by scanning electron microscopy. With the increasing CBE content from 0% to 1.2%, tensile strength of the films decreased from 10.67 to 9.37 MPa and elongation at break increased from 43.86% to 63.89%. The barrier performance and thermal stability of the films after CBE addition still met the food packaging standards. When more than 0.4% (w/w) CBE was added, the films could effectively shield ultraviolet rays. Besides, CBE addition to the films endowed excellent antioxidant properties and resistance to food-borne pathogens, ensured pH sensitivity, and extended the service life of the intelligent film. The films maintained good responsiveness in monitoring pork freshness, and the chromaticity difference was more obvious. Thus, the present study developed a multi-functional smart film with antioxidant, antibacterial, and pH-indicating functions.

J		Cikun Liu; Lixin Fan; Yunyi Yang; Qixing Jiang; Yanshun Xu; Wenshui Xia							Characterization of surimi particles stabilized novel pickering emulsions: effect of particles concentration, pH and NaCl levels.		Food Hydrocolloids					Pickering emulsions stabilized by biocompatible and edible particles have received increasing attentions recently. The surimi particles were firstly prepared and then the physical characteristics of soybean oil-based emulsions stabilized by surimi particles were investigated. The visual observation of emulsions indicated the emulsified phase volume increased with increasing concentrations (0-4 wt%) of surimi particles. The stability index of sample with 4.0 wt% particles at 0.5 or 0.6 oil fraction (0.5-4.0% or 0.6-4.0%) reached 99.1% and 100% after 14 days storage, respectively. The confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) and cryo-scanning electron microscope (cryo-SEM) observations showed that surimi particles were anchored onto the surface of oil droplets and aggregated to form gel-like network. The droplet size of samples with varied surimi particles at 0.5 oil fraction were found in the range of 76.09-90.38 mum. Additionally, 3.5 wt% surimi particles stabilized samples at 0.5 oil fraction (0.5-3.5%) under a series of pH (3, 5, 7, 9, 11) and NaCl conditions (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 M) showed similar droplet sizes but dissimilar zeta potential. The rheological results suggested the shear thinning and elastic behaviors of emulsions. Increasing either fish protein particles concentration or salt levels could decrease the T23 relaxation time of emulsions. In conclusion, surimi particles can function efficiently as edible Pickering particles to stabilize emulsions.

J		Cikun Liu; Wenxie Li; Mingyan Zhou; Shumin Yi; Beibei Ye; Hongbo Mi; Jianrong Li; Jinxiang Wang; Xuepeng Li							Effect of oxidation modification induced by peroxyl radicals on the physicochemical and gel characteristics of grass carp myofibrillar protein.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Protein oxidation of fish products during storage and processing is of interest recently. In this study, the effect of peroxyl radicals generated from 2,2′-azobis (2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) on the physicochemical and gel properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) from grass carp was investigated. After incubation with AAPH (0.04, 0.2, 1, 5, 25mM), the carbonyl and dityrosine content, and surface hydrophobicity index of MP were higher than that of the non-oxidation control. Conversely, this treatment decreased the free ammonia, total and free sulfhydryl content of MP progressively. The transformation from alpha-helix to beta-sheet and beta-turn in MP treated with AAPH was found. The fluorescence quenching of tryptophan occurred in the 5 and 25mM AAPH groups. When the AAPH concentration reached to 25mM, the protein solubility decreased to 58%, compared to the control group. Meanwhile, this AAPH treatment damaged the elastic feature of MP and also decreased the water holding capacity, gel strength and texture of gel, which were closely depended on the oxidation degree. The poor and rough microstructure provided solid and visible evidence for the loss of gel properties in oxidation treatment groups. In short, these results gave a deeper understanding for the changes of physicochemical and gel properties of fish MP subjected to oxidation environment. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5572	5583	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01123-1					FSTA:2022-07-Rc2935

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study investigates the effects of ozone water rinsing on the myofibrillar protein (MP) oxidation, color, and aroma characteristics of grass carp surimi. The results showed that the incubation of surimi with increased concentrations of ozone water led to a gradual generation of MP carbonyl derivatives and a loss of sulfhydryl. Additionally, the surface hydrophobicity of the MP increased, accompanied by a loss in tryptophan residues. The cross-linking via disulfide linkages and aggregates of the MP was formed after ozone water rinsing. The surimi treated with 3,5, 7 and 10 mg/L ozone water had higher L* and whiteness values than that of the control group. After rinsing with ozone water, the relative contents of main volatile compounds including hexanal, heptanal, and 1-octen-3-ol declined significantly. The results demonstrated that rinsing with ozone water can improve the sensory quality of grass carp surimi, and also lead to MP oxidation. Novelty impact statement. Rising surimi with ozone water is an effective method to improve the color property of freshwater fish surimi. The work provides detailed information about the effects of ozone water on protein oxidation, whiteness, and volatile compounds of grass carp surimi. This not only contributes to perform a reasonable assessment for scientists to the use of ozone water in surimi production, but also give a reference for the production of high-quality surimi. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15811					FSTA:2022-01-Rc0244

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The water-holding capacity (WHC) in surimi gel is a key factor that influences the quality and economic value of surimi-based products. This study investigated the effect of ozone water rinsing (1, 3, 5, 7, and 10 mg/L) on the WHC, gel microstructure, capillary pressure and protein-water interactions of grass carp surimi gel. Ozonation had entrapped water molecules within the gel matrix. The treatments improved gel strength and produced a homogenous microstructure of gels with smaller pore size. The contact angles in 1-10 mg/L ozone water treatments were significantly lower than that of the non-ozonated control. The gels of the 5 and 7 mg/L ozone water treatments had significantly higher capillary pressure and lower oxygen-deuterium peak area responses after hydrogen-deuterium exchange than that of other treatments and control. The ozone water-rinsed surimi gel had better WHC due to the oxidation modifications that promoted the cross-linking of myofibrillar proteins and the formation of a more hydrophilic gel network, which allowed the gel to immobilize more water molecules.

J		Cilingir, S.; Goksu, A.; Sabanci, S.							Production of pectin from lemon peel powder using ohmic heating-assisted extraction process.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The ohmic heating process is known as homogeneous, efficient, and rapid heating. In the present study, it was aimed to analyze the extraction of pectin from lemon peel using ohmic heating, to evaluate the specific pectin production coefficient (SPPC, mg/kJ) and compared it with traditional pectin production (TPP). The extraction process was carried out at 3 different temperatures (70-90 °C), 3 different solid: liquid ratios (1:30, 1:40, 1:50 g/ml), 3 different extraction holding times (0-30 min), and a constant pH (pH 2 that adjusted with citric acid). From the results, extraction conditions affected the pectin yield. As the temperature and extraction holding time increased, the pectin yields increased. In general, the 30-min pectin yields of the ohmic heating-assisted extraction (OHAE) process were similar to the pectin yields obtained from the TPP under the same conditions. Performance evaluation of pectin production was made for 90 °C, and energy efficiency was found to be over 69% for 3 different solid to liquid ratios. It has been stated that as an alternative to the TPP method, the OHAE process can be applied. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Cimbalo, A.; Alonso-Garrido, M.; Font, G.; Frangiamone, M.; Manyes, L.							Transcriptional changes after enniatins A, A1, B and B1 ingestion in rat stomach, liver, kidney and lower intestine.		Foods					Enniatins (ENs) are depsipeptide mycotoxins produced by Fusarium fungi. They are known for their capacity to modulate cell membrane permeability and disruption of ionic gradients, affecting cell homeostasis and initiating oxidative stress mechanisms. The effect of the acute toxicity of ENs A, A1, B and B1 at two different concentrations after 8 h of exposure was analysed in Wistar rats by a transcriptional approach. The following key mitochondrial and nuclear codified genes related to the electron transport chain were considered for gene expression analysis in stomach, liver, kidney and lower intestine by quantitative Real-Time PCR: mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MT-ND1), mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase 1 (MT-COX1), succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit A and ATP synthase F1 subunit alpha, respectively. Moreover, the expression of markers involved in oxidative stresssuperoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 1 (Gpx1), heme oxygenase 1, apoptosis B-cell lymphoma 2, Bcl2 Associated protein X (Bax), tumor suppressor protein (p53), inhibition of apoptosis nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells, immune system interleukin 1beta and intestinal tight junction Occludin merely in lower intestine tissues have been investigated. For mitochondrial genes, the main differences were observed for MT-ND1 and MT-COX1, showing its deficiency in all selected organs. With regard to the intestinal barriers cellular response to oxidative stress, the activity of the antioxidant gene SOD1 was decreased in a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, the catalytic enzyme GPx1 was also downregulated though merely at medium dose employed. On the contrary, the pro-apoptotic Bax and p53 regulators were activated after ENs exposure, reporting a significant increase in their expression. Furthermore, the alteration of intestinal permeability was assessed by the abnormal activity of the tight junction protein occludin. In summary, ENs may generate mitochondrial disorders and induce oxidative stress in intestinal barrier function. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cimini, A.; Moresi, M.							Circular economy in the brewing chain.		Italian Journal of Food Science					The main aim of this review was to check for the applicability of the concept of circular economy to brewing chain. By analyzing the beer brewing process, it was possible to identify the main brewery wastes formed and packaging materials used as well as their range of composition and yields. In order to reduce the contribution of packaging material to the carbon footprint of beer, it would be necessary to replace one-way containers used nowadays with lighter, reusable, or recycled ones. Even if the contribution of beer consumption phase was taken into account, there was no definitive solution about the less environmentally impacting beer packaging format. The direct management of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging for liquid foodstuffs could make available 100% recycled PET flakes to be reconverted into food-grade bottles with minimum downcycling to other non-food usage. The countless potential uses of brewery wastes in nutritional and biotechnological fields were tested in laboratory by disregarding any cost-benefit or market analysis. This was mainly because the estimated market price of dried brewer's spent grain (BSG) resulted to be about 450% higher than that of conventional lignocellulose residues. All the alternative uses hailed in the literature appeared to be more useful for publishing articles than for defining any economically feasible reusing procedure for all brewery wastes. Owing to their high moisture content, such wastes are so perishable as to prevent their safe usage in the human food chain. Currently, their use as-is in animal feeding is the disposal method not only economically feasible but also able to reduce the greenhouse gas load of beer packed in glass bottles (GB) by about one-third of that associated with packaging materials. Not by chance, it is practiced by most industrial and craft breweries.			Moresi, Mauro/0000-0002-4706-0129							2021	33	3	47	69	1120-1770				10.15586/ijfs.v33i3.2123					FSTA:2022-10-Hc9131
J		Cimini, A.; Cibelli, M.; Taddei, A. R.; Moresi, M.							Effect of cooking temperature on cooked pasta quality and sustainability.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Everyday pasta cooking has a large environmental impact. The aims of this work were to assess the effect of cooking temperatures (TC) that were lower than the water boiling point (TBW) on the main chemico-physical quality parameters of two pasta shapes (i.e., ziti and spaghetti) cooked at the conventional and minimum water-to-pasta ratios, as well as their optimum cooking time (OCT), cooking energy consumption, and carbon footprint, by using a novel eco-sustainable pasta cooker. Results. Once the effect of TC on OCT had been modeled in accordance with the Bigelow model, it was possible to estimate that the energy saved to heat the cooking water from ambient temperature to a lower temperature than TBW was smaller than the extra energy needed to complete the pasta cooking phase. After several cooking trials, the water uptake, cooking loss, textural properties, and thickness of the central nerve (as observed with a scanning electronic microscope) of cooked pasta were found to be independent of TC in the range of 85-98 °C. Conclusions. By using smaller amounts of water (~3 Lkg-1) and cooking at 85 °C with the eco-sustainable pasta cooker, the energy consumption reduced from the default value of 2.8 kWh kg-1 to ~0.45 kWh kg-1 and GHG emissions to about one sixth of those resulting from the use of the average European home appliances. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

The aim of this study was to produce a probiotic dairy dessert (Keskul) at an optimal RJ dose which is no adverse effect on physicochemical, rheological, sensory properties and functionality of the product. Initially, the growth parameters of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subspp. lactis in presence of RJ (0.001-10.0 mg/mL) were evaluated with Gompertz model. Then, the experimental (100 mg/mL) and estimated (56 mg/mL) Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of tested probiotic bacteria were determined according to predictive microbiology approach. Among probiotics, L. plantarum was found distinctively proper for producing dairy dessert with RJ. In this study, a new dairy dessert was developed consisting of RJ and L. plantarum. The control, including probiotic (D1), probiotic and RJ (1 mg/mL) (D2), probiotic and RJ (5 mg/mL) (D3) were analyzed during shelf life of dessert. The combination of L. plantarum with RJ (1 mg/mL) provided probiotic properties (>6 log CFU/g) and limited the mold count. Thus, the dairy dessert developed in this study may be a good alternative to innovative functional food using RJ with acceptable sensorial attributes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cinar, O.; Duman, O.; Tunc, S.							Optimization and validation of a new HPLC method for the determination of asparagine active ingredient in Asparagus lycicus and phytochemical characterization of endemic Asparagus lycicus specie.		Food Analytical Methods					A new HPLC method was optimized and validated for the determination of asparagine in Asparagus lycicus plant, an endemic specie found in Turkey, and the phytochemical analysis of this plant was carried out. For asparagine analysis, optimum separation was obtained with water: methanol mixture (95:5, v/v) in the presence of formic acid (FA): ammonium formate (AF) buffer as mobile phase by using a C18 reversed phase column. In this new method, retention time (0.61 min) of asparagine was very short. The linearity, accuracy, precision, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), and selectivity parameters were studied for the validation of optimized method. By this method, satisfactory recovery (100.102.86%) was obtained for asparagine analysis and LOD and LOQ values were determined to be 0.28 mg L-1 and 0.92 mg L-1, respectively. Freeze-thaw stability of the method is quite high. The results of matrix effect experiments showed that the matrix of Asparagus lycicus plant does not significantly affect the quantification analysis of asparagine. In the phytochemical characterization of endemic Asparagus lycicus plant, asparagine content (6.14 mg g-1 plant), total phenolic (13.22 mg GAE g-1 plant) and flavonoid (3.24 mg CE g-1 plant) contents, phenolic and flavonoid components (28.8 mg rosmarinic acid, 109.2 mg ferulic acid, 531.2 mg chlorogenic acid, 2.8 mg o-coumaric acid, 17.6 mg p-coumaric acid and 6.0 mg sinapic acid per kg plant), total antioxidant activity (13.2 mg mg-1 DPPH), vitamin C content (234.6 mg kg-1 plant), organic acid content as malic acid (2.9 mg kg-1 plant), sugar components (25.15 g fructose and 18.25 g glucose per kg plant), total anthocyanin content (5.15 mg kg-1 plant), total oil content (9.65%) and fatty acid components (oleic acid (55.36%), and linoleic acid (32.01%) and palmitic acid (7.61%)) were determined. The results of this study exhibited that endemic Asparagus lycicus plant might be considered as a promising natural source with antioxidant and bioactive constituents in the potential applications of pharmaceutical and food industries. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Sugars replacement as a strategy to control the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl and furanic compounds during cookie processing.		Foods					In the last decade, several preventive strategies were considered to mitigate the chemical hazard accumulation in food products. This work aimed to study the effect of different sugars on the development of the main chemical hazard in cookies. For this purpose, model biscuits prepared using sucrose, fructose, and glucose were baked at different temperatures (150, 170, and 190°C) and for different times (from 5 to 45 min), and the levels of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, such as 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), and furanic aromatic compounds were monitored. The replacement of sucrose in the cookie recipes with monosaccharides had as a consequence the highest accumulation of 3-DG (200-600 times higher), MGO, HMF, and furanic volatile compounds, while the use of sucrose allowed for maintaining the 3-DG, MGO, and HMF levels at less than 10 mg/kg dry matter in cookies for the estimated optimal baking time. Moreover, cookies with sucrose were characterised in terms of volatile compounds, mainly in terms of lipid oxidation products, while cookies with fructose or glucose baked at the highest temperature were characterised almost exclusively by Maillard reaction products, confirming a faster development of this reaction during baking at the studied temperatures. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparison of lactose free and traditional mozzarella cheese during shelf-life by aroma compounds and sensory analysis.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Aroma compounds and sensory features of lactose free (LFM) and traditional (TM) Mozzarella cheese have been investigated during their labeled shelf-life. Acetoin and 2-heptanone characterized both types of cheese at the production time. During the shelf-life, a statistically significant increase in the amount of the volatiles coming from amino acid and fatty acid metabolism occurred in the LFM samples after 8 days of storage and, to a lesser extent, in TM cheese after 13 days of storage. As regard sensory analysis, milk odor and milk flavor descriptors characterized TM and LFM in the early stage of their shelf-life; bitter and acid taste and yoghurt odor descriptors characterized LFM after 8 days and TM after 13 days. The differences between the two cheese types can be attributed to the proteolytic activity of the lactase enzyme. As a result, the volatile aroma profile and the sensory quality should be taken into account for a proper shelf-life definition of Mozzarella cheese and a shorter shelf-life should be suggested for LFM than TM cheese.

J		Cioch-Skoneczny, M.; Satora, P.; Skoneczny, S.; Klimczak, K.							Physicochemical characterization of wines produced using indigenous yeasts from cold climate grapes.		European Food Research and Technology					The aim of the study was the physicochemical characterization of wines produced using indigenous yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented grape musts, obtained from cold climate grapes. Saccharomyces cerevisiae MH020215 and Nakawazaea ishiwadae MG971259 yeast strains were used in this study. The musts obtained from white and red grapes of Johanniter and regent varieties were used as a fermentation raw material. In the produced wines, content of ethyl alcohol, total extract, sugars, free amino nitrogen was analyzed, along with determination of total and volatile acidity and volatile compounds profile. Additionally, organoleptic evaluation was performed. Wines obtained with native S. cerevisiae MH020215 strains were characterized with more favorable enological properties. Synthesis of desirable volatile compounds, especially esters, contributed to the creation of desirable aromatic profile of those wines. Moreover, those beverages contained higher levels of carbonyl compounds (especially acetaldehyde) and lower methanol content. Wines obtained using N. ishiwadae MG971259 cultures were represented by high total acidity level and substantial fusel alcohol content (mainly butanol, propanol), which resulted in an unfavorable sensory profile of the product. ©The Author(s) 2020.

Anisakis simplex (s.s.) larvae (Nematoda: Anisakidae) hidden in the mantle of European flying squid Todarodes sagittatus (Cephalopoda: Ommastrephidae) in NE Atlantic Ocean: food safety implications.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Few reports exist upon the occurrence and localization of zoonotic anisakid nematodes in T. sagittatus, especially in the mantle of the squid. The occurrence and site of infection of larval anisakids in 98 T. sagittatus caught West off St. Kilda, NE Atlantic Ocean, were investigated. Squids were examined for anisakids using the UV-Press method. In total, 689 nematodes were detected in the viscera and mantle. According to morphology, all the larvae (L3) were assigned to genus Anisakis. Diagnostic allozymes and mtDNA cox2 sequence analysis permitted to genetically identify all larvae as Anisakis simplex (s.s.) (N = 100). Overall prevalence (P = 81%) and mean intensity (mI = 8.6) of infection with A. simplex are provided. Most of the larvae present in the mantle cavity were embedded in the stomach wall or attached in the outer layer of the stomach and caecum (49%). Over a third of squids (37%) hosted A. simplex (s.s.) larvae in the mantle. A novel schematized representation of larvae distribution in the mantle is provided, showing where they were mostly located. According to the results obtained, the risk of anisakiasis associated with consumption of raw or undercooked T. sagittatus should be considered. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cipriano-Crespo, C.; Rivero-Jimenez, B.; Conde-Caballero, D.; Medina, F. X.; Mariano-Juarez, L.							The denied pleasure of eating: a qualitative study with functionally diverse people in Spain.		Foods					This qualitative study explores the difficulties in experiencing eating-derived pleasure within a group of functionally diverse people, based on personal interviews and Grounded Theory. Understanding the feelings and subjective experiences of functionally diverse people can help develop new approaches to address their loss of pleasure and motivation regarding food intake. The study included 27 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years, all of whom had a functional deficiency that affected the occupational aspects of the eating process. Interviews were conducted in clinical settings and several centres for differently abled people. Four main themes emerged from the analysis: eating through obligation; fear of eating; the social life of food; and the importance of the taste and visual aesthetics of food. These themes underscore the importance of taking into account the phenomenological experiences of pleasure in the eating process. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Genotype and successive harvests interaction affects phenolic acids and aroma profile of genovese basil for pesto sauce production.		Foods					Basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) is an essential ingredient of the Mediterranean cuisine due to its distinctive aroma. Genovese basil leaves are used to prepare "pesto", a condiment that has always caught the interest of consumers and producers. Usually, basil for industrial processing is harvested more than once to extract a higher yield. However, successive cuts can affect quality traits that play a crucial role in defining the product's final sensory profile. This research was aimed to evaluate the impact of cut on the quantitative and qualitative properties of three Genovese basil cultivars (Aroma 2, Eleonora and Italiano Classico) grown in an open field. Nitrate content, phenolic acids and aromatic profile were determined by ion chromatography (IC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and gas chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (GC/MS) analysis, respectively. The second harvest increased fresh biomass and total phenolic acids content by 172% and 413%, respectively, with Italiano Classico recording the highest values. The combination of second-cut Aroma 2 yielded the lowest nitrate (473.8 mg kg-1 of fresh weight) and Eugenol (2.4%) levels. In the second harvest, Eleonora showed an increase in eugenol and trans-alpha-bergamotene of 75.3% and 48.2%, respectively; whereas, eucalyptol and beta-cis-ocimene decreased by 34.4% and 51.6%, respectively. Although successive harvests may increase basil yield and quality overall, the cultivar-dependent response to successive cuts needs to be accounted for in order to accomplish standardization of industrial "pesto" sauce. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ciska, E.; Honke, J.; Drabinska, N.							Changes in glucosinolates and their breakdown products during the fermentation of cabbage and prolonged storage of sauerkraut: focus on sauerkraut juice.		Food Chemistry					Sauerkraut juice has not gained much scientific attention to date. Therefore, this study aimed to track changes in glucosinolates (GLS) during fermentation of white cabbage and the formation of corresponding breakdown products in sauerkraut and sauerkraut juice separately and to evaluate their stability during prolonged storage of the final products. The results obtained indicate that both sauerkraut and sauerkraut juice are a good source of bioactive compounds: ascorbigen and isothiocyanates. The stability of individual compounds during storage varied, and the absolute content of phytochemicals depended on the content of native GLS in the raw material and its bacterial composition. The dominant compound was ascorbigen, stable in acidic pH in both sauerkraut and sauerkraut juice, even after prolonged storage. Sauerkraut juice was also found as a rich source of bioactive isothiocyanates. One 250 mL glass of sauerkraut juice (after two weeks) can deliver approx. 75 mumol of bioactive ascorbien and isothiocyanates, hence it can be considered as functional food, delivering beneficial health effects.

Preliminary characterisation of wastes generated from the rapeseed and sunflower protein isolation process and their valorisation in delaying oil oxidation.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Since rapeseed and sunflower meals are two of the most representative oilseed crops in the world, this study was focused on ethanol-wash solutes (EWS) obtained as wastes from the protein isolation process of rapeseed and sunflower meals. These meals have been previously valorised; however, the use of the EWS is unexplored. The present study is aimed at the characterisation of their phenolic profile, and antioxidant capacity for preventing lipid oxidation in rapeseed, sunflower, and soybean oil, which has been used as a reference oil. The sunflower EWS exhibited more total phenolic compounds (TPC) and antioxidant activity (119.39 1.13 mg GA/g and 193.97 9.77 mg TE/g, respectively) than the rapeseed one (103.44 5.94 mg GA/g and 89.51 3.17 mg TE/g). The phenolic identification showed hydroxybenzoic and protocatechuic acid in the rapeseed EWS, and pyrogallol and caffeic acid in the sunflower EWS, as the main representative phenols. Both EWS at 15% increased significantly (p< 0.05) the oxidative stability of the oils in the Rancimat equipment with values of antioxidant activity index (AAI) from 1.01 to 1.20, depending on the type of oil employed. In conclusion, the rapeseed and sunflower EWS showed great potential, and they could be used as a source of natural antioxidants within the food industry, replacing the synthetic ones, and promoting the circular economy since they are agro-food wastes. © The Author(s) 2021.

J		Cisneros-Zevallos, L.							The power of plants: how fruit and vegetables work as source of nutraceuticals and supplements.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Plants are a rich source of nutraceuticals/supplements/phytonutrients/secondary metabolites. There are many industries, health care systems and academic activities involved in their use and promotion. However, many of these key players are peripherally involved in the science and policy behind their production, processing and utilisation. Here we will explore some key concepts related to the science and innovative strategies on the use of plants and their bioactive compounds for promoting human health and fight chronic diseases. Knowledge of how bioactive compounds are biosynthesized in the plant under different stress conditions and their mode of action against chronic diseases are key elements needed for an effective use of plant bioactives or nutraceuticals. This information can be the basis for developing preventive and therapeutic nutraceuticals to promote human health and could open opportunities for consumers to access low cost-effective use of plants as medicine, revalue crops, create new products and open new markets. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Response surface methodology and hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent based liquid phase microextraction combination for determination of cadmium in food and water samples.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this work, an ecologically friendly, cheap, and highly efficient hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent based liquid phase microextraction procedure was developed and coupled with flame atomic absorption spectrometry for determination of cadmium. Hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (HDES) was prepared by mixture of trihexyltetradecylphosphonium chloride and pivalic acid and used as extraction solvent. The formation of cadmium complex was achieved by sodium diethyldithiocarbamate trihydrate. Response Surface Methodology by Box-Behnken Design and three different models was used for optimizing experimental conditions and statistical analysis. Analytical parameters such as limit of detection, limit of quantification, relative standard deviation and enhancement factor were calculated as 1.6 g L-1, 5.0 g L-1, 3.3% and 43, respectively. Finally, the developed liquid phase microextraction method was applied to some food and water samples. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Fatty acid composition and volatile profile of longissimus thoracisetlumborum muscle from Burguete and Jaca Navarra foals fattened with different finishing diets.		Foods					The present study evaluated the effect of breed, Jaca Navarra (JN) vs. Burguete (BU), and finishing diet, conventional concentrate-diet 1 (D1) vs. silage and organic feed-diet 2 (D2), on the fatty acid composition and volatile profile of longissimus thoracis et lumborum muscle from forty-six foals. For this, foals were reared under a semi-extensive system and slaughtered at about 21months of age. The outcomes showed that breed and finishing regime had a significant (p< 0.05) effect on the lipid and volatile profile of foal meat. In particular, JN foals reported higher polyunsaturated fatty acid contents and better nutritional indices in line with the health guidelines; whereas, BU and D1groups generated higher amounts of total volatile compounds. However, it was the diet to occupy a central role in this study. Indeed, diet 2, due to its "ingredients" and composition, not only ameliorated the lipid profile of foal meat, but also reduced the generation of volatile compounds associated with lipid oxidation and minimized off-flavors. Thus, this diet could give an added value to the aromatic perception of meat and improve its sensorial acceptability. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Physicochemical composition and nutritional properties of foal burgers enhanced with healthy oil emulsion hydrogels.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study investigates the effect of animal fat replacement by oil mixture emulsion hydrogels on quality characteristics of foal burgers. Three batches were manufactured: control (CON)-100% of pork fat; treatments 1 and 2 (T1 and T2)-pork fat was totally replaced using oil mixture emulsions, avocado (T1) or pumpkin seed (T2) mixed with algal oil. These fat replacements were accompanied by a significant decrease in fat content (P<0.001) and colour parameters (P<0.05). Any significant differences in texture were observed in reformulated patties, except for gumminess (P<0.05) and chewiness (P<0.001). Moreover, a healthier fatty acid profile was reached (P<0.001), saturated fat decreased, mono-(T1) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (T2) increased and an improvement of all health indices was observed. However, the sensory acceptability of burgers was unaffected (P>0.05). Thus, these fat reformulations represent a promising strategy to obtain healthier foal burgers with improved nutritional characteristics without affecting sensory properties. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Nutritional and nutraceutical compounds of fruits from native trees (Ziziphus mistol and Geoffroea decorticans) of the dry chaco forest.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Mistol (Ziziphus mistol) and chanar (Geoffroea decorticans) fruits are traditionally used for both edible and medicinal purposes. The objective of the current study was to assess lipid, protein and phenolic composition from mistol and chanar fruits to provide better insights into their nutritional and nutraceutical properties. The total lipid content of whole fruits was found to be 9.8% (mistol) and 21% (chanar), and the contribution of essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was about 3.9 g PUFA/100 g and 11.5 g/100 g fruit, respectively. Lipids from mistol contained high amounts of total tocopherols (about 830 mg/kg). Fruits from both species showed relatively low protein contents (8% mistol, 5% chanar) with similar amino acids (AA) patterns. Essential AA represented about 28.3% (mistol) and 31.5% (chanar) of the total AA contents. The phenolic compounds from mistol fruits were dominated by flavonoids whereas those from chanar fruits comprised mainly phenolic acids, in particular hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives. Overall, findings from this study reinforce the value of mistol and chanar fruits as a source of nutritional and functional components. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Control					In this study the possibility to discriminate authentic honeys from adulterated honeys based on the FTIR spectra was investigated. Three types of authentic honeys (tilia, sunflower and acacia) were adulterated with agave, corn, inverted sugar, maple, and rice syrups in different percentages (5%, 10%, and 20%). The FTIR spectra was subjected to different spectral pre-treatment in order to improve the discrimination of authentic honeys from the adulterated ones using support vector machines (SVM) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). SVM using 1st derivate spectra provided the most suitable model for the discrimination of the samples (in the calibration step from a total of 97 authentic honeys, 97 were correctly classified, while from a total of 210 adulterated honey, all were classified as adulterated ones; in the validation step from a total of 48 authentic honeys, 39 were correctly classified, while from 104 adulterated honeys 6 were classified as authentic). Partial least squares regression (PLS-R) was used for the prediction of the physicochemical parameters using the FTIR spectra.

The effect of pre-treatment (blanching, ultrasound and freezing) on quality of freeze-dried red beets.		Foods					This paper presents the influence of blanching, ultrasonic processing and freezing conditions on selected physical properties of freeze-dried red beet, i.e., water activity, structure, porosity and shrinkage. Red beets subjected to a selected pre-treatment using its various parameters were frozen by three methods and then freeze-dried. Ultrasound reduced the water activity of samples. Blanching in water reduced shrinkage and improved porosity. In addition to the type of pre-treatment applied, the quality was also affected by freezing conditions before drying. Combined freezing resulted in the highest shrinkage and the lowest porosity and water activity. Slowly frozen samples were characterized by the best porosity. © 2021 by the authors.

Relationships between energy balance during early lactation and cow performance, blood metabolites, and fertility: a meta-analysis of individual cow data.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study was designed to contribute to the understanding of the relationships between energy balance (EB) in early lactation [4 to 21 d in milk (DIM)] and fertility traits [interval to start of luteal activity (SLA), interval to first observed heat (FOH), and conception to first artificial insemination (AI)], and their associated relationships with cow performance and blood metabolites between 4 to 150 DIM. Individual cow data (488 primiparous and 1, 020 multiparous lactations) from 27 experiments was analyzed. Data on cow performance, EB (on a metabolizable energy basis), and fertility traits were available for all cows, whereas milk progesterone data (to determine SLA) and periodic blood metabolite data were available for 1, 042 and 1, 055 lactations, respectively. Data from primiparous and multiparous cows were analyzed separately, with the data sets for the 2 parity groups divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4) according to the average EB during 4 to 21 DIM (EB range for Q1 to Q4: primiparous, -120 to -49, -49 to -24, -24 to -3, and -3 to 92 MJ/d, respectively: multiparous, -191 to -79, -79 to -48, -48 to -22, and -22 to 93 MJ/d, respectively). Differences between EB quartiles for production and fertility traits were compared. In early lactation (4 to 21 DIM), moving from Q1 to Q4 mean DMI and metabolizable energy intake increased whereas mean ECM decreased. During the same period, moving from Q1 to Q4 milk fat content, milk fat-to-protein ratio, and plasma nonesterified fatty acid and beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations decreased, whereas milk protein content and plasma glucose concentrations increased in both primiparous and multiparous cows. When examined over the entire experimental period (4 to 150 DIM), many of the trends in intakes and milk production remained, although the magnitude of the difference between quartiles was much reduced, whereas milk fat content did not differ between quartiles in primiparous cows. The percentage of cows with FOH before 42 DIM increased from Q1 to Q4 (from 46 to 72% in primiparous cows, and from 41 to 58% in multiparous cows). Interval from calving to SLA and to FOH decreased with increasing EB during 4 to 21 DIM, with these occurring 9.8 and 10.2 d earlier, respectively, in Q4 compared with Q1 (primiparous cows), and 7.4 and 5.9 d earlier, respectively, in Q4 compared with Q1 (multiparous cows). For each 10 MJ/d decrease in mean EB during 4 to 21 DIM, FOH was delayed by 1.2 and 0.8 d in primiparous and multiparous cows, respectively. However, neither days to first AI nor the percentage of cows that conceived to first AI were affected by daily EB during 4 to 21 DIM in either primiparous or multiparous cows, and this is likely to reflect a return to a less metabolically stressed status at the time of AI. These results demonstrate that interval from calving to SLA and to FOH were reduced with increasing EB in early lactation, whereas early lactation EB had no effect on conception to the first service.

J		Cizeikiene, D.; Gaide, I.; Basinskiene, L.							Effect of lactic acid fermentation on quinoa characteristics and quality of quinoa-wheat composite bread.		Foods					The application of selected starter cultures with specific properties for fermentation may determine steady lactic acid bacteria (LAB) variety and the characteristics of fermented products that influence nutritional value, the composition of biologically active compounds and quality. The aim of this research was to evaluate the influence of different LAB on the biochemical characteristics of fermented quinoa. Moreover, total phenolic content (TPC), and the antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of protein fractions isolated from quinoa previously fermented with LAB were investigated. Quinoa additives, including quinoa fermented with Lactobacillus brevis, were incorporated in a wheat bread recipe to make nutritionally fortified quinoa-wheat composite bread. The results confirmed that L. plantarum, L. brevis, and L. acidophilus were well adapted in quinoa medium, confirming its suitability for fermentation. LAB strains influenced the acidity, L/D-lactic acid content, enzyme activity, TPC and antioxidant activity of fermented quinoa. The maximum phytase activity was determined in quinoa fermented with L. brevis. The results obtained from the ABTS radical scavenging assay of protein fractions confirmed the influence of LAB strain on the antioxidant activity of protein fractions. The addition of 5 and 10% of quinoa fermented with L. brevis did not affect the total titratable acidity of wheat bread, while 10% of fermented quinoa with L. brevis resulted in a higher specific volume. Fermented quinoa additives increased the overall acceptability of bread compared with unfermented seed additives. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Cold brew coffee-pilot studies on definition, extraction, consumer preference, chemical characterization and microbiological hazards.		Foods					Cold brew coffee is a new trend in the coffee industry. This paper presents pilot studies on several aspects of this beverage. Using an online survey, the current practices of cold brew coffee preparation were investigated, identifying a rather large variability with a preference for extraction of medium roasted Arabica coffee using 50-100 g/L at 8 °C for about 1 day. Sensory testing using ranking and triangle tests showed that cold brew may be preferred over iced coffee (cooled down hot extracted coffee). Extraction experiments under different conditions combined with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that the usual extraction time may be longer than necessary as most compounds are extracted within only a few hours, while increasing turbulence (e.g., using ultrasonication) and temperature may additionally increase the speed of extraction. NMR analysis also revealed a possible chemical differentiation between cold brew and hot brew using multivariate data analysis. Decreased extraction time and reduced storage times could be beneficial for cold brew product quality as microbiological analysis of commercial samples detected samples with spoilage organisms and contamination with Bacillus cereus. © 2021 by the authors.

Food & Function					Consuming polyphenol-rich fruits and vegetables, including blueberries, is associated with beneficial health outcomes. Interest in enhancing polyphenol intakes via dietary supplements has grown, though differences in fruit versus supplement matrix on gut microbiota and ultimate phenolic metabolism to bioactive metabolites are unknown. To evaluate this, 5-month-old, ovariectomized, Sprague-Dawley rats were gavaged for 90 d with a purified extract of blueberry polyphenols (0, 50, 250, or 1000 mg total polyphenols per kg bw per d) or lyophilized blueberries (50 mg total polyphenols per kg bw per d, equivalent to 150 g fresh blueberries per day in humans). Urine, feces, and tissues were assessed for gut microbiota and phenolic metabolism. Significant dose-and food matrix-dependent effects were observed at all endpoints measured. Gut microbial populations showed increased diversity at moderate doses but decreased diversity at high doses. Urinary phenolic metabolites were primarily observed as microbially derived metabolites and underwent extensive host xenobiotic phase II metabolism. Thus, blueberry polyphenols in fruit and supplements induce differences in gut microbial communities and phenolic metabolism, which may alter intended health effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Characterizing consumer emotional response to milk packaging guides packaging material selection.		Food Quality and Preference					The decision-making process involved in food selection and consumption behaviors is confounded by mental integration of information, experiences, and emotions associated with the product (stimulus). The complex and fleeting but temporal nature of product-generated (PG) or product-associated (PA) emotions makes affectual experiences difficult to measure and interpret. This project aims to characterize the relationship between PA, and PG, emotions and consumer acceptability and purchase intent towards milk packaging. Participants (age: 18-65 years; n=50; milk consumers) performed Single Target Implicit Association Tests (ST-IAT) to capture PA emotions for various types of milk packaging (n=6; translucent high density polyethylene (HDPE), white HDPE, yellow HDPE, white polyethyleneteraphthalate (PET), paperboard, glass). Participants then interacted with individual packages for 30 s and their facial expressions were analyzed using automated facial expression analysis (AFEA) for implicit PG emotions. Explicit PG emotional response was assessed using a Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) questionnaire (43 emotional terms). ST-IAT did not identify significant PA emotions for packaged milk, but CATA data produced a reasonable description of approach/withdrawal motivation related to packaging pigmentation. Time series analysis of AFEA data provided evidence of significant differences in emotion intensity. The lack of difference between certain expressed emotions (e.g., happy and disgust) that maintain no related action units (AUs) indicate that AFEA software's output may not be identifying AUs and determining emotion-based inferences in agreement with FACS. Ultimately, both PA and PG emotions are valuable for informing packaging, food, and dairy industries towards consumer products via their packaging. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Clark, J. K.; Conley, B.; Samina Raja							Essential, fragile, and invisible community food infrastructure: the role of urban governments in the United States.		Food Policy					Community advocates and some scholars have argued that metropolitan food systems are central yet fragile food infrastructure. While recent events have suddenly laid this bare for many, it has been a matter of long-time concern to community advocates and scholars alike. Until recently, much of the food system has remained invisible to subnational policy makers. Within the past decade, an increasing number of urban local governments are heeding persistent calls from advocates and scholars to address the sustainability of metropolitan food systems in the United States. This paper provides a national overview of how urban local governments are engaging in policy for food systems (production, middle infrastructure, and retail and food service) across the United States. Results of a national survey of urban planners suggest that food systems policy is gaining attention, but progress needs to be made. While urban governments are prioritizing retail and food service and food production (both visible on the landscape), less attention is paid to the middle infrastructure that helps build self-reliance and resiliency by connecting production with consumption and building larger markets. Results also suggest that policy tools used by local governments are overregulating and underinvesting in food systems. Finally, the role of local governments supporting essential food system workers through planning and policy is raised.

Effect of bovine feeding system (pasture or concentrate) on the oxidative and sensory shelf life of whole milk powder.		Journal of Dairy Science					Correlating volatile compounds with the sensory attributes of whole milk powder (WMP) is fundamental for appreciating the effect of lipid oxidation (LO) on sensory perception. LO compounds can adversely affect the sensory perception of WMP by imparting rancid, metallic, and painty notes. Whole milk powders derived from milk produced by cows maintained on a pasture diet (grass and grass-clover mix) versus a nonpasture diet [total mixed ration (TMR); concentrates and silage] were stored at room temperature 21°C (ambient storage) and 37°C (accelerated storage) and analyzed for volatile compounds and sensory attributes every 2 mo for a total of 6 mo. Thirteen volatile compounds originating from LO were chosen to track the volatile profile of the WMP during storage. Color, composition, total fatty acid, and free fatty acid profiling were also carried out. Significant variations in the concentrations of 14 fatty acids were observed in WMP based on diet. Concentrations of free fatty acids increased in all sample types during storage. Similar trends in sensory attributes were observed with an increase in painty attributes, corresponding to an increase in hexanal. Buttery/toffee attributes were found to be more closely correlated with TMR WMP. Those WMP derived from pasture diets were found to be more susceptible to LO from a volatile perspective, particularly in relation to aldehyde development, which is likely due to increased concentrations of conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid found in these samples.

Evaluation of the presence and viability of Mycobacterium bovis in wild boar meat and meat-based preparations.		Foods					The aim of the present study is to provide information about the ability of Mycobacterium bovis to survive within wild boar (Sus scrofae) meat and meat-based preparations and the duration of this survival, and to consider the preservation of its infectious potential toward humans and animals. Meat samples were artificially contaminated with an M. bovis field strain and then stored at -20 °C, while two sausages batches were contaminated with the same field strain at two different concentrations, 105 CFU/g and 103 CFU/g, before storing them in proper conditions to allow for their ripening. A third sausage batch was contaminated by adding 2 g of wild boar lymph nodal tissue with active tuberculous lesions to the meat mixture. Bacteriological and biomolecular (PCR) methods were used to test the meat and sausage samples every 60 days and every 7-10 days, respectively. M. bovis was detected as still alive and viable on the frozen meat for the last test on the 342nd day, while from the sausage samples, M. bovis was isolated until 23 days after contamination. Our results indicate that M. bovis can stay alive and be viable for 23 days within sausages prepared with contaminated meat from infected wild boars. These products are usually eaten as fresh food after grilling, often cooking at a temperature that does not ensure complete inactivation of the pathogenic microorganisms present, which can pose a risk for humans to develop zoonotic tuberculosis. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Salt is the primary source of sodium in the human diet, and it is associated with hypertension and increased risk of heart disease and stroke. A growing interest in halophyte plants and food products containing this type of ingredient have been observed, to reduce the NaCl daily intake. In the present work, Sarcocornia perennis was incorporated as a food ingredient into crackers to replace the salt (NaCl) and to evaluate its impact on physical properties, water activity, nutritional composition, mineral profile, total phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and sensory evaluation. Concentrations of powder dried S. perennis from 1 to 10% were tested by replacing the initial salt content and adjusting the flour incorporation to the initial formulation. The incorporation of S. perennis had no relevant impact on cracker firmness, but it induced an increase in their crispness. Furthermore, the incorporation of this halophyte originated darker crackers, which was revealed by a decrease of L* and an increase of b* values. In terms of nutritional composition, the incorporation of S. perennis leads to the improvement of the snack's nutritional profile, namely in terms of phenolic compounds, antioxidant activity, and minerals, highlighting the high content in potassium, magnesium, and phosphor. Crackers with a content of 5% of S. perennis were sensorily well accepted and this level should be considered the limit of incorporation accepted by the panelists. However, by substituting 1% NaCl for an equal amount of S. perennis, it is possible to obtain a 70% reduction in sodium content, which is an important contribution to reducing the overall salt content of the diet. © 2021 by the authors.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				The use of alkaline phosphatase and possible alternative testing to verify pasteurisation of raw milk, colostrum, dairy and colostrum-based products.		EFSA Journal					Pasteurisation of raw milk, colostrum, dairy or colostrum-based products must be achieved using at least 72 °C for 15 s, at least 63 °C for 30 min or any equivalent combination, such that the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test immediately after such treatment gives a negative result. For cows' milk, a negative result is when the measured activity is ≤350 milliunits of enzyme activity per litre (mU/L) using the ISO standard 11816-1. The use and limitations of an ALP test and possible alternative methods for verifying pasteurisation of those products from other animal species (in particular sheep and goats) were evaluated. The current limitations of ALP testing of bovine products also apply. ALP activity in raw ovine milk appears to be about three times higher and in caprine milk about five times lower than in bovine milk and is highly variable between breeds. It is influenced by season, lactation stage and fat content. Assuming a similar pathogen inactivation rate to cows' milk and based on the available data, there is 95-99% probability (extremely likely) that pasteurised goat milk and pasteurised sheep milk would have an ALP activity below a limit of 300 and 500 mU/L, respectively. The main alternative methods currently used are temperature monitoring using data loggers (which cannot detect other process failures such as cracked or leaking plates) and the enumeration of Enterobacteriaceae (which is not suitable for pasteurisation verification but is relevant for hygiene monitoring). The inactivation of certain enzymes other than ALP may be more suitable for the verification of pasteurisation but requires further study. Secondary products of heat treatment are not suitable as pasteurisation markers due to the high temperatures needed for their production. More research is needed to facilitate a definitive conclusion on the applicability of changes in native whey proteins as pasteurisation markers. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

A comparative assessment of the nutritional composition of dairy and plant-based dairy alternatives available for sale in the UK and the implications for consumers' dietary intakes.		Food Research International					The popularity of plant-based dairy alternatives (PBDAs) products has grown exponentially in recent years creating a new market of PBDA. The aim of this study was to compare the nutritional content of plant-based alternatives of milk, yogurt and cheese with dairy equivalents and the impact on nutritional intake across the lifespan when they are substituted into UK diets. Nutritional information from cow's milk, yogurt, cheese and PBDAs available on the UK market was collected via manufacturers information. The products were categorised according to primary plant-based ingredient/s and compared with the equivalent dairy product. The National Diet and Nutrition Survey data was used to calculate the intake of milk, yogurt and cheese across all age groups and the energy and nutrient intake was calculated. Plant-based milk, cheese and yogurt alternative categories were then substituted for dairy intakes, and energy and nutrient intakes were calculated and compared to UK Dietary Reference Values. A total of 299 PBDA products were identified consisting of 136 milk alternatives, 55 yogurt alternatives and 109 cheese alternatives. All PBDAs were more expensive than dairy products. Milk contained more energy, saturated fat, carbohydrates, protein, vitamin B2, vitamin B12 and iodine, and less fibre and free sugars, than plant-based milk alternatives (P < 0.05). There were significant differences between yogurt and cheese and their corresponding PBDAs for energy, fat, saturated fat, carbohydrate, sugars, fibre protein, salt, and calcium (P < 0.05). These differences were reflected in the nutrient intakes of different age groups and the results demonstrated that PBDA may be useful as practical replacements of dairy products but cannot be considered nutritional replacements.

Food Chemistry					Thermal processing or the digestion process can alter the forms of arsenic (As) present in food. Identification of As species is necessary to accurately determine the risk associated with food consumption. X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) was used to investigate As species in rice, asparagus, and garlic boiled in water containing As (V), and in their bioaccessible fractions (solubilized As after gastrointestinal digestion). The XANES analysis revealed the presence of As (III) (11871.5 eV) or As (III)-S [As (III)-Cys, 11869.6 eV] solution in the cooked foods and in their bioaccessible fractions. The percentage of trivalent species (12-55%) followed the order asparagus >> ricegarlic. In the asparagus and garlic samples, part of the As (V) (tetrahedral form) [11875 eV] that had been added appeared in the form of an octahedral As (V) compound [As (V)-glycerol, 11876 eV]. All these changes could considerably modify the risk associated with ingestion of As-contaminated food. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Comparison on sensory profile, volatile composition and consumer's acceptance for PDO or non-PDO tigernut (Cyperus esculentus L.) milk.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cyperus esculentus tubers are the raw material to prepare tigernut milk (horchata), which can be marketed under Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) "C hufa de Valencia". The aim of this study was to characterize commercial tigernut milks and compare PDO and non-PDO products. The following aspects were studied: (i) volatile profile, (ii) descriptive sensory profile, (iii) consumer satisfaction degree. The key volatile compounds were limonene, benzaldehyde, linalool and m-methoxyanisole. Principal component analysis indicated a mix of PDO and non-PDO samples in the groups formed. The highest consumer satisfactions were observed for 2 PDO samples. Penalty analysis showed that 80% of non-PDO samples needed improvements, while this percentage drastically decreased to 40% for PDO samples. The online study proved that a lot of people drink horchata, less people know the PDO C hufa de Valencia and even less people consume the protected product consciously. In conclusion, there was not a clear difference among protected and non-protected tigernut milks respect to volatile compounds but there were differences in the degree of consumer preference. So, it is clear that a lack of knowledge regarding the product and its PDO exists and needs attention. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Variability in the temporal perception of polyphenol-related sensations in extra virgin olive oil and impact on flavor perception.		Food Quality and Preference					Polyphenol-related sensations (PRS) in extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), i.e.bitterness, pungency and astringency, are often identified by consumers as negative drivers of preference. A deep comprehension of how these sensations interact is a fundamental step to better understand consumers' preferences toward EVOO. Perception of PRS proved to be variable on an individual basis, but studies that involve the EVOO matrix and that consider the whole consumption experience are lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore the variability in PRS perception in EVOO and to evaluate the impact of this perceptual variability on flavor perception over time. For this study, 11 Italian EVOOs were initially considered as well representative of the expected variability in terms of olive tree cultivars and areas of production. Projective Mapping followed by Ultra-Flash Profile were used to get the six EVOOs that formed the most diverse subset with respect to PRS. A panel of 19 assessors (9 females) was characterized for the perception of bitterness, astringency and pungency through intensity evaluation of water solutions with five levels of increasing concentration of the solute related to a specific PRS, independently for each oral sensation. PRS perception responses were used to split the panel into two groups, one with a higher level of perception to PRS (HP-PRS) and one with a lower level of perception to PRS (LP-PRS). After training on EVOO descriptors, both groups evaluated the samples dynamically and in triplicate, using Temporal Check-All-That-Apply methodology. Differences in PRS perception were confirmed in EVOO samples and were shown to impact flavor perception over time. Pungency and astringency were the major modulators of the temporal flavor perception, whereas bitterness had a negligible role. The findings in this study are a contribution to improve the understanding of dynamics of perception in EVOO and provided insights that may be helpful to promote EVOO sensory evaluation.

Med-index: a food product labeling system to promote adherence to the Mediterranean diet encouraging producers to make healthier and more sustainable food products.		Italian Journal of Food Science					Consumers are increasingly demanding transparency in food labeling as they want more and better information about what they are eating and where their food comes from. Several food indexes have been developed in the last decades to promote healthy eating with the aim of reducing certain diseases such as obesity, cancer, and diabetes. The Mediterranean diet is known to be one of the healthiest dietary patterns, and it is associated with a lower incidence of mortality from all-causes, and it is also related to a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases; however, a comprehensive index that quantifies the Mediteraneaness of foods is still missing. The real European challenge is to identify a uniform labeling system for the whole of Europe which promotes a healthy lifestyle. This article describes the development of the Mediterranean Index (MI), which aims to accurately measure the degree of food Mediterraneaness. The MI simultaneously integrates nutritional and sustainability characteristics of foods. The MI may provide an objective basis for the use of the "Mediterraneaness" label on food products, which can ultimately promote adherence to the Mediterranean diet encouraging producers to make healthier and more sustainable food products. Growing consumer concern toward health foods for better health can be a factor useful to promote the applicability of the precision nutrition principles by means of conscious choice.

J		Clulow, A. J.; Salim, M.; Hawley, A.; Boyd, B. J.							Milk mimicry-triglyceride mixtures that mimic lipid structuring during the digestion of bovine and human milk.		Food Hydrocolloids					It is well recognised that the digestion of milk lipids releases fat-soluble bioactives, primarily in the intestines where 70-90% of lipid digestion occurs. The digestion of milk lipids under intestinal conditions yields fatty acids and monoglycerides that self-assemble into liquid crystalline phases that are species-dependent, suggesting that they play a role in directed nutrition. Yet to date, no studies have proposed mimicking milk liquid crystalline structuring by precisely tailoring the lipids in the digesting emulsions. In this work, the preparation of lipid emulsions that mimic lipid self-assembly in bovine and human milk was examined. Mixtures of between four and eight off-the-shelf homotriglycerides were prepared based on the total fatty acid content of bovine and human milks and these were emulsified using casein. If kept at or above body temperature after emulsification the emulsions were stable and 846% (bovine) and 863% (human) of the lipids could be digested under intestinal conditions over 2 h. The evolution of liquid crystalline phases was determined as a function of extent of lipid digestion enabled by the well-defined nature of the lipid emulsion and the emulsifying buffer solution. It was found that eight triglycerides with a fine balance of medium-and long-chain triglycerides were required to mimic the bicontinuous cubic phases observed in digesting commercial bovine milk. In contrast, the micellar cubic phases observed in the digestion of donor human milk could be mimicked with simpler lipid mixtures comprising four-seven triglycerides comprising mostly long chain and unsaturated triglycerides. These simplified mixtures are therefore representative colloidal structures that mimic the lipid self-assembly behaviour in digesting dairy emulsions, which can be used as oral delivery vehicles of fat-soluble bioactives targeted towards particular populations including infants in the first year of life.

J		Coban, A. E.; Ergur, N.							Chia mucilage coating: applications with gojiberry extract for shelf life extension of Oncorhynchus mykiss and it's antibacterial and oxidative effects.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study was carried out to evaluate chia mucilage coating and goji berry extract as preservative agents in filleted trout during storage for 18 days at 4 °C. The trout fillets were separated into four lots and applied the following treatments by immersion processing: I) Control (without coating), II) Chia (Ch), III) Chia+ 1% Goji berry extract (Ch+ 1GE), and IV) Chia+ 2% Goji berry extract (Ch+ 2GE), then stored for 18 days at 4 °C. Results demonstrated that microbial growth was delayed in 2%GE containing chia coated group. In addition, the chia coated samples retarded the increase in the contents of TVB-N, pH, and TBA during storage. In addition, shelf life of the samples stored at 4°C was determined as 3 days in control group, 15 days in groups of coated with Ch and Ch+1%GE and 18 days in group of coated with Ch+2% GE. Practical applications. Quality of rainbow trout fillets was keeped by edible coating formed from chia seed mucilage With the prepared coatings were inhibited oxidation and microbial growth during fillet storage. A high shelf life was determined by the coatings formulated with 1% gojiberry extract and 2% gojiberry extract. Chia mucilage coating may be an alternative to other coatings in the coating of meat and meat products. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15114					FSTA:2021-06-Rc2243

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, the use of barberry fruit (Berberis crataegina DC.) extract was investigated as a natural red colorant in chewing gum, jelly, and marshmallow samples at different percentages (1%, 5%, and 10%). The color stability (DeltaE) values were determined for all sample groups and it was observed that the barberry extract had higher color stability than beet juice concentrate, which was used in the control chewing gum samples as a natural red colorant. The water activity values were within the specified limits for all sample groups except the jelly samples and 10% colorant added chewing gum. The antioxidant and anti-radical properties of all the samples were significantly improved by the addition of the barberry extract. According to the results of the texture profile, the hardness values of all chewing gum and marshmallow samples decreased with the addition of barberry extract, and this decrease became even more important as the concentration increased.

Fatty acid composition, mineral contents, and glycemic index values of chips produced with different cooking methods and lupine (Lupinus albus L.) flour formulations.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The oil samples were rich in linoleic acid (mean: 45.39%), and then, the most common fatty acids were oleic (mean: 36.79%), palmitic (mean: 8.27%), and stearic acids (mea: n 5.61%). Calcium 463.80-4065.50 mg/kg, boron 0.00-12.26 mg/kg, chromium 0.00-10.25 mg/kg, copper 3.92-44.48 mg/kg, iron 0.00-149.23 mg/kg, magnesium 34.07-2002.53 mg/kg, potassium 2,463.21-6779.90 mg/kg, and sodium 91.69-8532.82 mg/kg were determined in the chips samples. Glycemic index values of the chips made using whole lupine flour varied between 50.10 and 60.90. In addition to this, the glycemic index values of the whole lupine flour added chips were found lower than the glycemic index values of hulled lupine flour added chips. It was observed that the glycemic index values of the lupine flour added samples were lower than the control group (without lupine flour added). The lowest glycemic index value was found in the sample with the highest ratio of lupine flour. Practical applications. Lupine flour is an ideal food component because it has a high content of protein, dietary fiber and bioactive compound, and low lipid and starch content. It has been clearly demonstrated that lupine has a high potential as a food component and has increased its importance in the food industry. Lupine is one of the new protein sources of recent time and is more economical than animal protein sources. The fat content of the lupine seed is generally 10% saturated and 90% polyunsaturated fatty acids. Lupine does not contain gluten and gluten-like proteins and has become an alternative raw material for gluten-free products used in the diets of celiac patients. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Science					Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is an economically and nutritionally important fish. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of the various steps of the canning process and of different filling media (olive oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, and high oleic sunflower oil) on the fat-and water-soluble vitamin contents of swordfish. An HPLC-based method was used for this purpose. The canning process led to loss of some vitamins, particularly of vitamin D3. Loss of this vitamin mainly occurred during storage and although important (89.34% to 91.36%), canned swordfish can be considered a good source of vitamin D3, providing between 50% and 64% of the RDI. The frying process also caused significant loss of vitamin B9 (73.7%). However, the vitamin E content increased due to contributions from the frying and filling oils. The canned swordfish packed in olive oil had lower vitamin A (107.35 g/100 g) and E (1.58 mg/100 g) contents than the fish packed in sunflower oil (193.28 g/100 g and 2.28 mg/100 g, respectively). The swordfish packed in sunflower oil also had the highest B2 (0.036 mg/100 g) content. The swordfish packed in corn oil had the lowest vitamin A (80.17 g/100 g) and B2 (0.012 mg/100 g) contents, while the samples packed in high oleic sunflower oil had the lowest contents of vitamins B9 (0.14 g/100 g) and B12 (2.37 mg/100 g). Practical Application. Swordfish (Xiphias gladius) is consumed worldwide and is economically very important in the seafood industry. The canning process caused losses of some vitamins, particularly of vitamins D3 and B9; however, the vitamin E content increased due to the frying and filling oils. The study findings may contribute to increasing knowledge about how processing, storage and the filling medium influence the composition of canned fish. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Use of microbial inoculants during cultivation maintain the physiological, nutritional and technological quality of fresh-cut romaine lettuce.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Nutrition-sensitive agriculture is a novel concept in the agri-food system, which considers the implementation of techniques able to guarantee the nutritional value of the produce, the sustainability of the production and, at the same time, to reduce the ecological impact of agricultural practices. These principles can be also introduced in the fresh-cut market with the aim of maintaining the produce quality during shelf life. In this context, the use of bio-based products is rapidly increasing for improving economic and environmental sustainability of cropping systems during cultivation and shelf life. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of three different bacterial-based formulations (Paenibacillus pasadenensis, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, Pseudomonas syringae) applied during romaine lettuce cultivation by monitoring the changes of several quality indexes at harvest and during storage. Results showed that the application of microbial inoculants during romaine lettuce cultivation contributed to the maintenance of nutritional, functional and perceived quality attributes of leaves during shelf life. The microbial inoculants prevented the development of postharvest fungal pathogen B. cinerea. Moreover, the study evidenced different modes of action of the different inoculants and, in the case of Pseudomonas syringae 260-02 application, a direct involvement of ascorbic acid-mediated antioxidant mechanisms was observed.

Identification of new antimicrobial peptides that contribute to the bactericidal activity of egg white against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis at 45°C.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A recent work revealed that egg white (EW) at 45°C exhibits powerful bactericidal activity against Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, which is surprisingly little affected by removal of the >10 kDa EW proteins. Here, we sought to identify the major EW factors responsible for this bactericidal activity by fractionating EW using ultrafiltration and nanofiltration and by characterizing the physicochemical and antimicrobial properties of the resulting fractions. In particular, 22 peptides were identified by nano-LC/MS-MS and the bactericidal activities of representative peptides (with predicted antimicrobial activity) were further assessed. Two peptides (FVPPVQR and GDPSAWSWGAEAHS) were found to be bactericidal against SalmonellaEnteritidis at 45°C when provided in an EW environment. Nevertheless, these peptides contribute only part of this bactericidal activity, suggesting other, yet to be determined, antimicrobial factors.

From mangrove to fork: metal presence in the Guayas Estuary (Ecuador) and commercial mangrove crabs.		Foods					Mangrove wetlands provide essential ecosystem services such as coastal protection and fisheries. Metal pollution due to industrial and agricultural activities represents an issue of growing concern for the Guayas River Basin and related mangroves in Ecuador. Fisheries and the related human consumption of mangrove crabs are in need of scientific support. In order to protect human health and aid river management, we analyzed several elements in the Guayas Estuary. Zn, Cu, Ni, Cr, As, Pb, Cd, and Hg accumulation were assessed in different compartments of the commercial red mangrove crab Ucides occidentalis (hepatopancreas, carapax, and white meat) and the environment (sediment, leaves, and water), sampled at fifteen sites over five stations. Consistent spatial distribution of metals in the Guayas estuary was found. Nickel levels in the sediment warn for ecological caution. The presence of As in the crabs generated potential concerns on the consumers' health, and a maximum intake of eight crabs per month for adults is advised. The research outcomes are of global importance for at least nine Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The results presented can support raising awareness about the ongoing contamination of food and their related ecosystems and the corresponding consequences for environmental and human health worldwide. © 2021 by the authors.

NMR-based metabolomic study of Apulian Coratina extra virgin olive oil extracted with a combined ultrasound and thermal conditioning process in an industrial setting.		Food Chemistry					The innovative combination of ultrasound (Us) with a thermal exchanger to produce high quality extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) was studied using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and multivariate analysis (MVA). Major and minor metabolomic components of Apulian Coratina EVOO obtained using the two methods were compared. Early and late olive ripening stages were also considered. An increased amount of polyphenols was found for EVOOs obtained using the Us with respect to the conventional method for both early and late ripening stages (900.8 10.3 and 571.9 9.9 mg/kg versus 645.1 9.3 and 440.8 10.4 mg/kg). NMR spectroscopy showed a significant increase (P < 0.05) in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as well as in the tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol derivatives, such as oleocanthal, oleacein, and elenolic acid, for both ripening stages. In conclusion, NMR spectroscopy provides information about the metabolomic components of EVOOs to producers, while the Us process increases the levels of healthy bioactive components.

Myricetin improves metabolic outcomes but not cognitive deficit associated to metabolic syndrome in male mice.		Food & Function					Myricetin is a flavonol highly prevalent in edible vegetables and fruits, with recognized hypoglycemic and anti-obesity effects, besides great antioxidant capacity. Thus, this study sought to investigate whether myricetin is able to improve metabolic and behavioral outcomes found in monosodium l-glutamate (MSG) obese mice, a model of metabolic syndrome characterized by early hyperinsulinemia associated to obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, anxiety and cognitive deficit. Newborn male mice received MSG (4 mg kg-1 day-1, s. C.) on alternate days during the first 10 days of life for obesity induction, while control pups received equimolar saline solution. From postnatal day 90 to 135, MSG mice were orally treated with myricetin (50 mg kg-1 day-1) or distilled water, while control animals received vehicle. During the last week of treatment, all groups were submitted to behavioral tests: open field maze, elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. At the end of treatment, animals were euthanized for collection of liver, serum and adipose tissue fat pads. Myricetin treatment reduced the elevated serum levels of glucose and triglycerides, typically found in MSG mice, as well as restored peripheral insulin sensitivity and liver steatosis. Moreover, myricetin ameliorated the lack of thigmotaxis and exploratory behavior, but did not improve the cognitive deficit presented by MSG mice. Therefore, this study contributes to the pharmacological validation of myricetin as an affordable and healthy therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and most of its comorbidities. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					New or used barrels can be applied in ageing of alcoholic beverages. Compounds adsorbed in wood migrate between beverages along with wood extractives. As barrel ageing is costly and time-consuming, processes using wood fragments have been gaining interest. These generate wood residues for which the reuse is still not well established. This work aims at the reuse of oak fragments for the additive ageing of alcoholic beverages. Oak chips, previously immersed in fortified wine, were applied to beer, wine and grape marc spirit. Wood compounds and adsorbed wine volatiles were extracted, with more impact and satisfactory yields on beer composition. Also, wood adsorbed beverages compounds in a subtractive ageing phenomena. Beer formulations using different binomial wood concentration/temperature combinations were generated and presented to trained tasters. Higher temperatures and wood concentrations led to prominence of wood descriptors and lower perception of fruity and floral aromas, reflecting the changes in chemical composition.

Multivariate chemometric analysis for the evaluation of 22 Citrus fruits growing in Brazil's semi-arid region.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This work provides the first screening of 22 Citrus cultivars grown in a semi-arid tropical region based on their most relevant phytochemical and polyphenolic features through a multivariate approach. Multivariate chemometric analysis through PCA analysis were used combined to reach grouping of the Citrus fruits and unveil the main characteristics associated with the fruits identity and origin region. Citric acid was the dominant organic acid (4.43-140.54 g L-1), representing 93.9% of total organic acids quantified in the samples. Glucose and fructose corresponded, respectively, to 51.2 and 48.8% of the total sugars quantified in samples. Hesperidin was the predominant flavonoid identified in all Citrus, particularly in oranges, while in pomelos, naringin was the major polyphenol. The results showed that most phenolics are related to Citrus identity, as PCA revealed the grouping of samples according to the species or variety. The associations found for the Citrus obtained from the same semi-arid tropical location could be used as basis for authentication of these Citrus samples, as judged by the distinctions found between the phenolic profiles, sugars and organic acids. This could be used for other fruits upon verification of their polyphenolic association with location and climate.

In vitro gastrointestinal digestion impact on the bioaccessibility and antioxidant capacity of bioactive compounds from tomato flours obtained after conventional and ohmic heating extraction.		Foods					In times of pandemic and when sustainability is in vogue, the use of byproducts, such as fiber-rich tomato byproducts, can be an asset. There are still no studies on the impact of extraction methodologies and the gastrointestinal tract action on bioactive properties. Thus, this study used a solid fraction obtained after the conventional method (SFCONV) and a solid fraction after the ohmic method (SFOH) to analyze the effect of the gastrointestinal tract on bioactive compounds (BC) and bioactivities. Results showed that the SFOH presents higher total fiber than SFCONV samples, 62.47 1.24-59.06 0.67 g/100 g DW, respectively. Both flours present high amounts of resistant protein, representing between 11 and 16% of insoluble dietary fiber. Furthermore, concerning the total and bound phenolic compounds, the related antioxidant activity measured by 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid (ABTS) radical cation decolorization assay presented significantly higher values for SFCONV than SFOH samples (p< 0.05). The main phenolic compounds identified in the two flours were gallic acid, rutin, and p-coumaric acid, and carotenoids were lycopene, phytofluene, and lutein, all known as health promoters. Despite the higher initial values of SFCONV polyphenols and carotenoids, these BCs' OH flours were more bioaccessible and presented more antioxidant capacity than SFCONV flours, throughout the simulated gastrointestinal tract. These results confirm the potential of ohmic heating to modify the bioaccessibility of tomato BC, enhancing their concentrations and improving their antioxidant capacity. © 2021 by the authors.

Food & Function					Background & aims. Concord grape (Vitis lambrusca) juice (CGJ) contains a unique combination of polyphenolic compounds with diverse effects on human health. It also has an intense sensory profile that may modify food choice. Daily consumption of CGJ over 8 weeks reduced fasting blood glucose. However, the impact on 24h-postprandial glucose response from CGJ is still not clear. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of CGJ flavor intensity and phenolic content on 24 h postprandial glucose concentrations, appetitive sensations, and cognitive function in adults with excess body weight when consumed alone or with a meal. Methods. In a randomized, double-blind, crossover design study, participants consumed three types of beverages: 100% CGJ, a polyphenol-free grape flavored drink with the same flavor essence (LP) or a polyphenol-free grape flavored drink with reduced flavor essence (LPF) either without (trial I) or with (trial II) a meal. 24 h glucose was measured through continuous glucose monitoring. Phenolic metabolite excretion was assessed in 24 h urine samples. Appetite (hunger, thirst, fullness, desire to eat, and prospective consumption) and cognitive function (alertness, energetic, strength, calmness, and relaxation) were assessed hourly through visual analog scales. Results. Thirty-four adults completed trial I and 34 adults completed trial II. When consumed with a meal, beverages with customary flavor essence (CGJ and LP) reduced hunger, desire to eat, and prospective consumption and consumption of the polyphenol-free reduced flavor essence beverage was associated with higher 24 h glucosetAUC. No consistent effects were observed for cognitive outcomes. When consumed alone, CGJ was related to lower glycemic responses by those excreting a higher concentration of the phenolic metabolite iso/ferulic-3′-O-glucuronide, but in beverages without CG phenolics and reduced flavor essence, glycemia was higher among those excreting higher concentrations of caffeic acid-O-sulfate. Conclusions. Both natural phenolics and flavor essence of CGJ may help to moderate appetite and glycemia.

Expanding information on the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of iron and zinc in biofortified cowpea seeds.		Food Chemistry					This work presents new findings on the nutritional quality of recently introduced biofortified and non-biofortified cowpea cultivars as well as some common beans. ICP-MS was used for the measurements. Biofortified cowpea cultivars showed high levels of Fe and Zn, greater than 60 and 40 mg kg-1 dry weight, respectively. The in vitro digestion protocol enabled simultaneous evaluation of bioaccessibility and bioavailability. Fe levels in cowpea cultivars were ca. 2.5-fold higher than in common beans. Cowpea seeds also had higher Zn levels, reaching 50.1% bioaccessibility and 44.2% bioavailability. Cooking improved the availability of micronutrients in bean seeds. The cooked biofortified Arace cowpea showed a high Zn bioavailability above 60%. Consumption of 50 g of Arace would contribute 27% and 48% of the Fe and Zn DRI for 1-3-year-old children. The new cowpea cultivars biofortified are a potential vehicle for improving the Fe and Zn status in groups in which the micronutrient deficiency is prevalent. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Pasta products enriched with moringa sprout powder as nutritive dense foods with bioactive potential.		Food Chemistry					Five fettuccini formulations containing 5% (5MSP), 10% (10MSP), 15% (15MSP), 20% (20MSP), and 30% (30MSP) of moringa sprout powder (MSP) were produced aimed at improving the nutritional and bioactive profile of conventional pasta. A gradual increase of protein, lipids, fiber and mineral content was observed in fettuccine as the MSP amount increased, while carbohydrates were reduced. MSP-addition also increased the levels of thiamine, riboflavin, gamma- aminobutyric acid, glucosinolates and the antioxidant activity in pasta. All pasta doughs showed similar rheological parameters. Textural properties decreased after MSP inclusion, but the values obtained were close to those of control. Incorporation of MSP up to 10% did not modify substantially the sensory attributes of fettuccine, but higher amounts had a negative impact. Thus, addition of MSP up to 10% is a promising technological approach to improve the nutritional and functional properties of pasta without compromising consumer acceptance.

Foods					The use of natural compounds as food preservatives is becoming increasingly popular as it is perceived positively by consumers. Among these substances, essential oils have attracted great interest owing to their antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. However, several challenges impair the use of essential oils in food products, such as their degradation or loss during food processing and storage, the strong aroma, even at low concentrations, which may negatively affect the sensory characteristics of food. In this context, the development of nanoformulations able to stabilize essential oils may represent a smart solution to this issue. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of alginate-based nanoformulations enriched with lemongrass (Cymbopogon nardus) essential oil (LEO) and Tween 80 against several fungi namely Penicillium expansus, Aspergillus niger and Rhizopus spp. Firstly, the flow behavior of systems at different concentrations of alginate (1%, 2% and 3% w/w) were studied. Then, emulsion-based nanoformulations at different concentrations of lemongrass essential oil in the range of 0-2% w/ w were stabilized by a fixed amount of Tween 80, characterized and tested for their antifungal activity. Our results showed that the best nanoformulation able to inhibit Rhizopus spp., Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus niger, for at least 10 days, was constituted by 1% alginate/1.5% LEO/1% Tween 80. Hence, the incorporation of essential oil into nanoformulation systems may represent a valid alternative to overcome the disadvantages that limit the commercial application of essential oils. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Folate is a fundamental vitamin for metabolism in plants and humans. A modelling approach has been developed to characterize the reactivity of folates in cowpea seeds during germination at 30 °C, using a water-to-seed ratio of 1:1 (w/w). For this purpose, the concentrations of folic acid, 10-formylfolic acid, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate were determined in seeds during germination times up to 96 h. Two reaction models were sequentially built and adjusted to experimental data to describe changes in concentration in cowpea seed during two germination phases: before 14 h and after 48 h. Results showed intense enzymatic interconversion of all folate vitamers into 5-methyltetrahydrofolate before 14 h of germination and high enzymatic production of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, 5-formyltetrahydrofolate and tetrahydrofolate after 48 h of germination. This study suggests that a long germination process could be more beneficial than soaking to increase the production of bioavailable folates within the seed for human consumption.

J		Cohen, N.; Ilieva, R. T.							Expanding the boundaries of food policy: the turn to equity in New York City.		Food Policy					Policymakers acknowledge that the food system is multidimensional and that social determinants affect diet-related health outcomes, yet cities have emphasized programs and policies narrowly connected to food access and nutritional health. Over the past fifteen years, the boundaries of food governance have expanded to include a wider range of issues and domains not previously considered within the purview of food policy, like labor, housing, and education policies. This paper illustrates the processes by which this shift occurs by presenting the case of New York City, which has broadened its food governance to a larger set of issues, requiring cross-sectoral initiatives that have led to a more expansive notion of food policy. This shift has resulted from an increased political salience of income inequality and poverty, and a change in municipal leadership that led to a greater emphasis on equity and social justice. Efforts to address equity affected the food system, and in turn led to diverse policies that have expanded the boundaries of food policy. The paper traces this evolution and outlines the implications of these findings for food governance and future urban food policy development and research.

J		Cohen, Y.; Margier, M.; Lesmes, U.; Reboul, E.; Livney, Y. D.							Mechanisms of absorption of vitamin D3 delivered in protein nanoparticles in the absence and presence of fat.		Food & Function					Novel protein-based nanovehicles offer alternatives to fat for delivery of lipophilic bioactives (nutraceuticals and drugs), yet they raise important questions regarding the bioavailability and absorption mechanism of the bioactive without fat. To provide answers, we chose vitamin D3 (VD3) as a model lipophilic-nutraceutical, re-assembled casein-micelles (rCM) as model protein-based nanovehicles, and non-fat yoghurt as a model food. We prepared three yoghurt formulations: 3% fat with VD3 dissolved in milk-fat, non-fat and 3% fat, both latter enriched with VD3 within rCM. Following in vitro digestion, VD3 retention and bioaccessibility were high (~90% and ~70%, respectively) in all formulations. VD3 uptake by Caco-2 cells was three-fold higher (p< 0.005) in the non-fat yoghurt enriched with VD3 in rCM compared with enriched fat-containing yoghurts. SR-BI, CD36 and NPC1L1 transporters were involved in VD3 absorption irrespective of the composition. Thus, our findings demonstrate that protein nanovehicles may improve VD3 bioavailability, without altering its absorption mechanism compared to that from fat. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Emergence of new ST301 shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli clones harboring extra-intestinal virulence traits in Europe.		Toxins					O80:H2 enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) of sequence type ST301 is one of the main serotypes causing European hemolytic and uremic syndrome, but also invasive infections, due to extra-intestinal virulence factors (VFs). Here, we determined whether other such heteropathotypes exist among ST301. EnteroBase was screened for ST301 strains that were included in a general SNP-phylogeny. French strains belonging to a new heteropathotype clone were sequenced. ST, hierarchical clusters (HC), serotype, resistome, and virulome were determined using EnteroBase, the CGE website, and local BLAST. The ST301general phylogeny shows two groups. Group A (n = 25) is mainly composed of enteropathogenic E. coli, whereas group B (n = 55) includes mostly EHEC. Three serotypes, O186:H2, O45:H2 and O55:H9, share the same virulome as one of the O80:H2 sub-clones from which they derive subsequent O-antigen switches. The O55:H9 clone, mainly present in France (n = 29), as well as in the UK (n = 5) and Germany (n = 1), has a low background of genetic diversity (four HC20), although it has three Stx subtypes, an H-antigen switch, and genes encoding the major extra-intestinal VF yersiniabactin, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Diverse heteropathotype clones genetically close to the O80:H2 clone are present among the ST301, requiring close European monitoring, especially the virulent O55:H9 clone. © 2021 by the authors.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					This work studied the foam-mat drying (FMD) of bacaba pulp, evaluating the parameters of foam-forming and the effects of thickness layer (5-15 mm) and temperature (50-70 °C) during the drying process. The results showed the need for an emulsifier, in addition to the foaming agent, to obtain a low density and stable foam. The powder showed high content of proteins (15.90.6%), fibers (49.60.4%), and lipids (35.60.2%). The combination of the lowest drying temperature and thickness resulted in a final product with good solubility (37.51.2%) and a high antioxidant capacity (52513 mumol TE g-1), which suggests a great potential for use in the development of functional products.

Foods					Spore-forming bacteria are a great concern for fruit juice processors as they can resist the thermal pasteurization and the high hydrostatic pressure treatments that fruit juices receive during their processing, thus reducing their microbiological quality and safety. In this context, our objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Ultraviolet-C (UV-C) light at 254 nm on reducing bacterial spores of Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris, Bacillus coagulans and Bacillus cereus at two stages of orange juice production. To simulate fruit disinfection before processing, the orange peel was artificially inoculated with each of the bacterial spores and submitted to UV-C light (97.8-100.1 W/m2) with treatment times between 3 s and 10 min. The obtained product, the orange juice, was also tested by exposing the artificially inoculated juice to UV-C light (100.9-107.9 W/m2) between 5 and 60 min. A three-minute treatment (18.0 kJ/m2) reduced spore numbers on orange peel around 2 log units, while more than 45 min (278.8 kJ/m2) were needed to achieve the same reduction in orange juice for all evaluated bacterial spores. As raw fruits are the main source of bacterial spores in fruit juices, reducing bacterial spores on fruit peels could help fruit juice processors to enhance the microbiological quality and safety of fruit juices. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					The consumption of black rice has grown in recent years due to its particular organoleptic properties and high content of antioxidant polyphenols, which make it a sort of natural functional food. However, heat treatment applied during cooking can influence the content and the composition of antioxidant components, particularly anthocyanins, the main compounds of black rice, responsible for its color. The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of different cooking techniques (boiling, microwaves oven, under pressure pot and risotto preparation) on the chemical and nutritional composition of the Italian Artemide black rice. Different cooking methods had significant and different impact on rice composition. Proximate composition was not affected by cooking, except for moisture, which increased, and fiber content, which decreased. Total polyphenols, total anthocyanin content, and antioxidant capacity were reduced; moreover, anthocyanins and phenolic acids determined by HPLC-DAD generally decreased, with the only exception of protocatechuic acid. The risotto preparation was the most useful cooking technique to preserve anthocyanins and antioxidant activity. Our results demonstrated the importance to study cooking methods and to evaluate their impact on rice characteristics, in order to preserve its nutritional and beneficial properties. © 2021 by the authors.

An approach to the consumption of smoked paprika in Spain and its impact on the intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.		Foods					"Pimenton de La Vera" smoked paprika is a traditional kind of smoked paprika, the production of which is regulated by a protected designation of origin. The traditional drying/smoking process provides the "Pimenton de La Vera" smoked paprika with a peculiar flavour which has gained acceptance in multiple markets. However, this process also gives rise to non-desirable substances, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This paper attempts to ascertain the consumption levels of smoked paprika per person in Spain in order to establish the intake of PAHs derived from this food spice. With this purpose in mind, a research study was carried out using questionnaires in three different smoked paprika consumption scenarios: food companies, households and restaurants. The results from this research proved that the average consumption of smoked paprika per person per year in Spain is 139 g. Overall, the intake of PAHs derived from smoked paprika was proven to represent a negligible fraction of the total intake, with this ingredient being far behind the PAH contribution represented by other food products. These results could help consolidate the smoked paprika production sector by providing evidence of the scarce contribution of smoked paprika to PAH intake and justifying the traditional production with smoke drying, which is the differentiating quality trait of this spice. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					This study aimed to assess the impact of two soil managements and training systems on yield and wine aroma compounds of Negroamaro variety grown in a warm climate region (southern Italy). Cover crop (CC) and soil tillage (ST) as soil management, whilst bilateral Guyot (BG) and monolateral Guyot (MG) as training systems were compared. Free and bound volatile fractions were evaluated by GC-MS. ST and CC as well as BG and MG significantly affected yield parameters. In particular, yield was higher in ST and BG than in CC and MG, respectively; moreover, it was found to be positively influenced by interaction between BG and ST. Regarding aroma compounds, significant interactions between soil management and training system factors were observed. In case of free volatiles, the most positive interaction was found between BG and ST, whereas, for bound volatiles, the best interaction was represented by MG with both soil tillage and cover crop. Vine leaf area and development over vine growth stages along with water stress levels played an important role in determining the aroma profile as well as yield parameters. In conclusion, the training system significantly interacted with soil management and affected most of important aroma compounds in Negroamaro wine. © 2021 by the authors.

Physicochemical characterisation of restructured Fenalar and safety implications of salt and nitrite reduction.		Food Control					There is a new trend to produce dry-cured ham from lamb in shorter times by boning the ham before salting to later obtain restructured hams that are easier to dry and slice. However, little information about the physicochemical characteristics of Norwegian Fenalars during the process or the safety implications of their elaboration procedures is reported in the literature. The aim of this study was to characterize the colour, texture and physicochemical properties of restructured Fenalars when using Standard Salting (SS), Salt Reduced (SR) and a Non-Nitrite Salt Reduced (NNSR) treatments. Microbiological safety implications of the elaboration process when using the different salting treatments were also assessed using predictive microbiology. To do so, sixty Fenalars were elaborated using a Standard Salting (SS), a Salt reduced (SR) and a Non-Nitrite Salt Reduced (NNSR) treatments. Physicochemical characterization (instrumental colour and texture and Zinc Protoporphyrin content) was performed at the end of the process using thirty Fenalars. The rest of the Fenalars were used to characterize the product through the elaboration process (pH and aw) for the evaluation of microbiological hazards when using the different salting treatments using predictive microbiology. Results showed a significant increase in softness when reducing salt content and a decrease of redness when no nitrite was used, attributed to the formation of ZnPP content instead of nitrosylmyoglobin. In terms of risk assessment, the decrease of aw through the elaboration process reduced the growth capacity of all the microorganisms evaluated. However, microbiological safety implications in salt reduced Fenalars are important, especially when no nitrite was added, because the considerable increase of growth potential of L. monocytogenes. The increase of growth potential of proteolytic C. botulinum is very little and no relevant effect of nitrite on growth potential of S. aureus was observed. Predictive microbiology and optimization of the process to enhance ZnPP formation can help to ensure safety and quality of salt reduced restructured Fenalars without additives.

Evaluation of dry-cured ham pastiness through rheological measurements of aqueous extracts obtained in vitro mimicking the mastication process.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Pastiness is a dry-cured ham defect that can be determined by sensory and chemical analysis. Since pastiness produces an increase of saliva viscosity, rheology might be useful to instrumentally evaluate this defect. The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheological behaviour of water extracts obtained in vitro mimicking the mastication of dry-cured ham samples with different pastiness intensities. Commercial samples from different groups (non-pastiness (NPG), medium pastiness (MPG) and high pastiness (HPG) groups) were sensorially and rheologically analysed. Effect of temperatures and HPP treatments at 7 °C, 20 °C and 35 °C were also evaluated. Results. Showed that apparent viscosity of the water extracts increased with the increase of pastiness and decreased with temperature. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between NPG/MPG and HPG samples and between 25 °C and 37 °C in HPG. After HPP, sensory pastiness disappeared in samples from MPG at any temperature and decreased from 6.8 to 0.2 in samples from HPG only when HPP35 was used. Although the increase on viscosity of oral fluid is related to the sensory pastiness, other factors seem to be involved in the mechanism of pastiness perception. Despite this, HPG samples can be distinguished from MPG and NPG samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Processing parameters involved in the development of texture and tyrosine precipitates in dry-cured ham: modelisation of texture development.		Meat Science					The aim of this study was to quantify the effects of different processing parameters on texture development and the incidence of white film and tyrosine crystals in dry-cured ham. Hams were dry-salted for 0.65, 0.8 or 1.0 days/kg. After drying for 45 days at 5 °C, they were dried at 10, 15 or 20 °C until reaching 33% weight loss and, thereafter, dried at 25 °C until reaching 36 or 40% weight loss. The salting time, drying temperature and target weight loss significantly affected the texture and incidence of white film and tyrosine crystals. A beneficial effect of drying at 20 °C on texture was found, which was especially important for low target weight loss (33%). Besides, hams dried at 20 °C and those with 40% weight loss showed higher incidence of tyrosine crystals. Contour plots and predictive models for texture can be used to define optimal processing parameters All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Development of an integrated process involving palm industry co-products for monoglyceride/diglyceride emulsifier synthesis: use of palm cake and fiber for lipase production and palm fatty-acid distillate as raw material.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present study, monoglycerides (MAG) and diglycerides (DAG) were produced by an enzymatic esterification reaction of palm fatty-acid distillate (PFAD) (co-product) with glycerol, using a dry fermented solid (DFS) with lipase activity obtained by solid-state fermentation in palm cake and fiber (co-products) in an integrated process. The reaction using DFS as biocatalyst was optimized by a central composite rotatable design. MAG and DAG yields of 25% and 40% were obtained, respectively, in a reaction with molar ratio of 2:1 (glycerol: PFAD), 9.6 wt% water content, and 20 wt% DFS at 50 °C after 48 h. MAG and DAG synthesis using the commercial biocatalyst Lipozyme RM-IM (immobilized lipase from Rhizomucor miehei) was also evaluated. The highest MAG and DAG yields in reactions with Lipozyme RM-IM were attained in a molar ratio of 1:1 (glycerol: PFAD), 3 wt% enzyme at 50 °C after 10 h (MAG and DAG yields of 27.9% and 53.05%, respectively). Results obtained with DFS and Lipozyme RM-IM were close to the WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines, in which these mixtures must contain at least 70% MAG + DAG and a minimum of 30% MAG.

M. del							Merging heat stress tolerance and health-promoting properties: the effects of exogenous arginine in cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.).		Foods					In the last decades, cauliflower consumption has increased due to its observed beneficial effects on human health, especially on chronic diseases. Furthermore, the use of arginine has been shown to improve the heat stress tolerance of plants by increasing the polyamine content. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of the exogenous application of arginine on the physical and chemical quality parameters of cauliflower florets under heat stress. For this, we applied two concentrations of arginine (1 and 4 mM) to the leaves of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var. botrytis L.) plants grown in three different temperatures (ambient, elevated, and extreme). Our data show that potassium and phosphate, as well as iron were the most abundant macro- and micronutrients, respectively. The combination of high temperature and exogenous application of arginine increased the antioxidant activity, total content of phenolic compounds, polyamines, and proteins. The data presented herein indicate that the combination of an adequate heat stress and the appropriate foliar arginine treatment may be a useful strategy that could be used to increase the number of valuable plant compounds in our diet. © 2020 by the authors.

J		Collen, M.							Online methods for the detection of sugar contamination in condensate systems.		International Sugar Journal					Many sugar mills struggle with contamination in condensate given that sugar can cause major disruptions in the boiler (s) producing steam for production. The sugar decreases the surface tension of the boiler water, allowing a property called "foaming" whereby the boiler water can move from a boiler drum into the steam space and. Hence, into the production steam system. This phenomenon in turn causes contamination of product, safety risks to personnel, and damage to expensive production. The effect of the contamination is also typically a full plant shutdown, time loss from cleaning boilers, chemical cost, labour cost, product loss, and alike. Detecting sugar contaminant has typically been done using conductivity methods. This relies on detecting by-products of the sugar process, or by hydrolysis of the sugar-producing conductive species. Although it is simple, it relics on the factors outlined, and is typically insensitive and non-selective. Online methods have been developed with the aim of detecting sugar contamination. These methods involve multiple technologies, and each have their advantages and disadvantages. New methods using fluorescence detect low-level sugar "thin juice". TOC (total organic carbon) measurement, refractive index, multiple oxidation reduction measurements, pH, and others are available. This paper investigates the methods but aims to clarity value for money, measurement range, and application suitability for sugar mills. The outcome of the paper is to ensure sugar mills are well informed to ensure the selection of technologies is based on suitability for process, rather than sales and marketing campaigns.

Natural co-occurrence of multiple mycotoxins in unprocessed oats grown in Ireland with various production systems.		Toxins					The natural co-occurrence of 42 mycotoxins was investigated in unprocessed oat grains grown in Ireland. The sample set included a total of 208 oat crops harvested during 2015-2016 and produced using conventional, organic, or gluten free farming systems. A range of different toxins was identified, including the major type A (neosolaniol, HT-2 and T-2 toxins, T-2 triol, and T-2-glucoside, co-occurring in 21 samples) and B trichothecenes (deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and deoxynivalenol-3-glucoside), enniatins (B1, B, and A1, co-occurring in 12 samples), as well as beauvericin, alternariol, mycophenolic acid, and sterigmatocystin. The influences of sowing season, year, and production system were investigated, eventually indicating that the latter factor may have a higher impact than others on the production of certain mycotoxins in oats. The most frequently quantified compounds were HT-2 (51%) and T-2 (41%) toxins, with gluten free oats containing significantly lower concentrations of HT-2 compared to conventionally produced oats. Although the prevalence and concentrations of mycotoxin found in oat samples in this study should be substantially reduced by processing. However, as mycotoxin occurrence is clearly influenced by multiple factors, controlled field trials should be carried out to define optimal agronomic practices and mitigate mycotoxin production. Furthermore, this work highlights the need for regularly testing cereal-based foods with multi-residue analytical methods with wider specificities than the traditionally screened and regulated toxins, to generate knowledge on the occurrence of several mycotoxins that are, to date, rarely investigated. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Using a combination of biochemical, transcriptomic, and physiological analyses, we elucidated the mechanisms of physical and chemical withering of tea shoots subjected to UV-C and ethylene treatments. UV-C irradiation (15 kJ m-2) initiated oxidation of catechins into theaflavins, increasing theaflavin-3-monogallate and theaflavin digallate by 5- and 13.2-4.4-fold, respectively, at the end of withering. Concomitantly, a rapid change to brown/red, an increase in electrolyte leakage, and the upregulation of peroxidases (viz. Px2, Px4, and Px6) and polyphenol oxidases (PPO-1) occurred. Exogenous ethylene significantly increased the metabolic rate (40%) and moisture loss (30%) compared to control during simulated withering (12 h at 25 °C) and upregulated transcripts associated with responses to dehydration and abiotic stress, such as those in the ethylene signaling pathway (viz. EIN4-like, EIN3-FBox1, and ERFs). Incorporating ethylene during withering could shorten the tea manufacturing process, while UV-C could enhance the accumulation of flavor-related compounds.

MoS2 quantum dots for on-line fluorescence determination of the food additive allura red.		Food Chemistry					This work presents an on-line fluorescence method for the allura red (AR) determination. The method is based on the fluorescence quenching of dots of MoS2 because of their interaction with the non-fluorescence dye. MoS2-dots were synthetized and characterized by spectroscopic techniques and High Resolution Transmission Electronic Microscopy (HR-TEM). The simultaneous injection of the nanomaterial and the dye in a flow injection analysis system allows the determination of allura red at 1.7*10-6 M concentration level with a very good accuracy and precision (Er minor than 10% and RSD lower than 8%) and a sampling frequency of 180 samples per hour. Moreover, the interaction fluorophore-quencher results a dynamic inhibition mechanism. The proposed methodology was applied to the AR analysis in soft beverages and powders for gelatine preparation. Colourant concentrations of 632 mg/L (n=3) and 0.300.01 mg/g (n=3) were found, respectively. These results were validated by high performance liquid chromatography technique.

Foods					Oxidative stress, one among the several factors responsible for the gluten toxicity in celiac disease, together with inflammation and duodenal mucosal injury, are only partially reduced by the gluten-free diet. Thanks to their phenolic profile, the pigmented varieties of corn could be an interesting source of dietary antioxidants for the formulation of new gluten-free ingredients. The aim of this research was: (1) to characterize the phenolic profile and the associated antioxidant properties of corn samples with different pigmentation, using spectrophotometric and chromatographic techniques and (2) to assess the stability of anthocyanins during the gastro-intestinal digestion. The pigmented varieties showed a significantly higher content of polyphenols compared to the common yellow varieties and, as a consequence, a higher antioxidant activity. Although corn is among the cereals most frequently used in gluten-free products, it can produce an inflammatory response in some celiac patients. Therefore, after the chemical characterization, the safety of the pigmented varieties for celiac patients was confirmed using different in vitro models (cell agglutination test and the measure of transepithelial electrical resistance). Although in vivo studies are necessary, the data collected in this study underline that the pigmented corn could have a role in reducing the oxidative stress at the intestinal level in celiac subjects. © 2021 by the authors.

Frances flower extract as a rennet substitute: effect on textural, microstructural, microbiological, antioxidant properties, and sensory acceptance of miniature cheeses.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The most common milk-clotting enzymes in the cheese industry are recombinant chymosins. Food naturalness is a factor underpinning consumers' food choice. For consumers who avoid food with ingredients from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), the use of vegetable-based rennet substitute in the cheese formulation may be a suitable solution. Artichokes that deviate from optimal products, when allowed to bloom due to flower protease composition, are excellent as raw material for vegetable rennet preparation. As enzymatic milk clotting exerts a significant impact on the characteristics of the final product, this product should be studied carefully. Results. Mature flowers from unharvested artichokes (Cynara scolymus cv. Frances) that did not meet aesthetic standards for commercialization were collected and used to prepare a flower extract. This extract, as a coagulant preparation, enabled the manufacture of cheeses with distinctive characteristics compared with cheeses prepared with chymosin. Rennet substitution did not affect the actual yield but led to significant changes in dry matter yield, humidity, water activity, protein content, and color, and conferred antioxidant activity to the cheeses. The rennet substitution promoted significant modifications in springiness, and in the microstructure of the cheese, with a more porous protein matrix and an increment in the size of the fat globules. Both formulations showed a similar microbiota evolution pattern with excellent microbiological quality and good sensory acceptance. Conclusions. The rennet substitute studied here produced a cheese adapted to specific market segments that demand more natural and healthier products made with a commitment to the environment but well accepted by a general cheese consumer. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Determining the harvest date of table grapes is very important to achieve high-quality bunches with adequate soluble solids content, low titratable acidity, and high concentrations of polyphenols. Table grape consumption has increased worldwide due to its phenolic compound content and its beneficial effects on human health. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the phenolic ripening of "BRS Vitoria" seedless table grapes at different ripening stages using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. For this purpose, a trial was carried out during 2016 in a commercial vineyard of "BRS Vitoria" seedless grape located in Marialva, state of Parana (Southern Brazil). Berry samples were assessed weekly, starting at veraison until full ripeness. At each ripening stage, the berries were analyzed to determine their physicochemical characteristics and polyphenolic profile. It was observed that "BRS Vitoria" grapes can be harvested approximately 28 days after veraison, when the berries reach soluble solids content higher than 15°Brix and low titratable acidity. The grapes presented a typical anthocyanin profile of hybrid grapes, composed of 3-glucoside and 3,5-diglucoside derivatives. In addition, pelargonidin traces were also observed, and this aglycone is rarely detected in grapes. The total anthocyanin concentration, as malvidin-3,5-diglucoside equivalents, is close to 596.9 mg kg-1. Concerning flavonols, myricetin and quercetin are detected in greater proportions, and this cultivar can also be considered an important source of proanthocyanidins. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Validation and use of an accurate, sensitive method for sample preparation and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry determination of different endocrine-disrupting chemicals in dairy products.		Foods					Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous substances capable of altering the human hormone system and causing various diseases such as infertility and cancer as a result. In this work, a method for determining twenty-three different EDCs including parabens, alkylphenols, phenylphenols, organophosphorus pesticides, bisphenol A and triclosan in dairy products was developed. Samples are conditioned by addition of acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid, centrifugation and clean-up of the extract by continuous solid-phase extraction. EDCs in the extract are derivatised by heating in a microwave oven and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The proposed method features good limits of detection (6-40 ng/kg) and precision (relative standard deviation < 7.6%); also, it is scarcely subject to matrix effects (1-20%). EDC recoveries from spiked samples ranged from 80 to 108%. The method was used to analyse a total of 33 samples of dairy products including cow, sheep and goat milk, yoghourt, milkshakes, cheese, cream, butter and custard. Bisphenol A was the individual contaminant detected in the greatest number of samples, at concentrations from 180 to 4800 ng/kg. 2-Phenylphenol and ethylparaben were found in more than one-half, at concentrations over the range 130-3500 and 89-4300 ng/kg, respectively. In contrast, alkylphenols, organophosphorus pesticides and triclosan were detected in none. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J.							beta-glucan release from fungal and plant cell walls after simulated gastrointestinal digestion.		Journal of Functional Foods					beta-glucans are soluble fibre found in plant and fungal cell walls, which are linked with reduced serum lipid levels. This study investigates the beta-glucan release from two fungal samples (mycoprotein and white button mushroom) compared with two plant samples, oat and barley bran. Our results indicate no beta-glucan release after the simulated gastrointestinal digestion of the uncooked fungal samples. In contrast, following cooking and digestion, beta-glucans were released from the mycoprotein matrix. Pancreatic enzymes facilitated the solubilisation of beta-glucans. Protein and carbohydrate digestion appeared independent of beta-glucan release in both uncooked and cooked samples. Conversely, the viscosity increased in the samples that showed a significant release of beta-glucans at the end of gastrointestinal digestion. Structural analysis by scanning electron microscopy showed changes in the uncooked and cooked samples before and after digestion. This study shows for the first time the different behaviour in beta-glucan release from fungal and plant samples.

J		Coluccia, B.; Agnusdei, G. P.; Miglietta, P. P.; Leo, F. de							Effects of COVID-19 on the Italian agri-food supply and value chains.		Food Control					The spread of COVID-19 has not only led to many deaths but also to social and economic downturn globally. The study represents an exhaustive compilation of relevant macroeconomic data regarding the status of the agri-food sector from a demand side perspective and an overview of the food product producer and consumer prices after the shock. Its main purpose is to assess the resilience level of the agri-food sector to the coronavirus pandemic, analyzing its effect on commodity prices and focusing on the supply and value chain. The results highlight that fresh and perishable products, whose production or harvest took place during the first wave of COVID-19, have suffered price level effects, while storable products have not registered significant impacts. This phenomenon is mainly due to the vulnerability of the harvest and production phases, which affected fresh and perishable products supply, and to the resilience of transports and logistics, which instead ensured the supply of storable products to the final consumer. Especially in case of future pandemic waves, the implications and information deriving from the present analysis could support researchers, policy makers and managers, serving as an assessment tool to build suitable strategies for the whole agri-food supply chain and thus ensure sector resilience during these unprecedented times.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to encapsulate allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) in zein ultrafine fibers and evaluate its effects as active packaging on postharvest quality of strawberry. Fresh strawberries (cv Camarosa) were collected from a local agro-industry at commercial maturity, washed, dried, and stored at 4 °C with 4% and 8% AITC, in free form and encapsulated in zein fibers. The strawberries were analyzed for weight loss, firmness, titratable acidity, soluble solids concentration, and pH from day 0 (fresh strawberries) to 20, every five days. After 15 days of storage, the strawberries were also analyzed for free phenolic content, antioxidant capacity using ABTS and DPPH methods, and total anthocyanin content. AITC successfully reduced weight loss of strawberries for an additional five days. The encapsulation of AITC using zein was efficient when lower concentrations (4%) are applied. The increase of AITC on zein fibers saturated the medium and reduced fruit quality. All AITC treatments significantly reduced the firmness and reddish color of the stored strawberries, the AITC addition suppressed the total phenolic and anthocyanin contents. These findings suggest that low concentrations of AITC encapsulated in zein fiber provide a promising method to maintain strawberry quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Extra ingredients are often used in traditional sourdough production recipes by artisan bakeries. These ingredients may be the source of microorganisms or stimulate the growth and/or the metabolic activities of the microorganisms added to or naturally present in the flour-water mixture. The present study examined the influence of the addition of lemon juice or apple juice as source of citrate or malate, respectively, on the growth and activity of the citrate- and malate-positive Companilactobacillus crustorum LMG 23699 strain (formerly known as Lactobacillus crustorum LMG 23699), used to initiate firm (dough yield of 200) wheat sourdough productions, and on the flavour of the baked goods produced. Three fermentation strategies were applied, namely one-step long fermentation sourdough production processes with the addition of juice at the start (Type 2) and backslopped fermentations with the addition of juice either only at the start of the sourdough productions or at the start of the sourdough productions and at the beginning of each subsequent refreshment step during the whole backslopping process (both Type 3). It turned out that the starter culture strain used prevailed during all sourdough productions performed. Yeasts were particularly present in Type 3 sourdough productions, although lemon juice retarded their growth. Due to high yeast activity, high concentrations of ethanol and glycerol were produced toward the end of the sourdough productions. Addition of lemon juice stimulated the production of lactic acid, acetic acid, and the buttery flavour compounds acetoin and diacetyl, because of citrate conversion, during the Type 2 and Type 3 sourdough productions. In Type 3 sourdough productions, these compounds were found in higher concentrations only when lemon juice was added at each backslopping step. Alternatively, the addition of apple juice led to high concentrations of lactic acid because of malolactic fermentation in both Type 2 and Type 3 sourdough productions. Moreover, the addition of apple juice increased the initial concentrations of the carbohydrates (fructose, glucose, and sucrose) and sugar alcohols (mannitol and sorbitol), which were exhausted upon backslopping or accumulated in the sourdough matrix, respectively. Baked goods produced using sourdoughs obtained from the Type 2 and Type 3 sourdough productions with the addition of juice at each backslopping step were significantly different in flavour from doughs supplemented with the respective juices and lactic acid and/or Type 3 sourdough productions with the addition of juice only at the start.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work aimed to use thermoplastic extrusion technology as a pretreatment for whole grain flours (corn, parboiled brown rice, and sorghum) and the incorporation of germinated millet at 5% for the production of gluten-free bread. The study characterized the flour (chemical composition and particle size distribution), evaluated the dough (pasting, empirical and fundamental rheological properties) and analyzed the bread quality characteristics (physical, structural, and textural measurements). Thermoplastic extrusion enabled the development of consistency, improved water absorption (105-153%) and viscoelastic properties of the doughs. This process caused an increase of the specific volume (66, 33 and 82%, respectively for corn, rice and sorghum made bread), and formation of better internal air cell distribution in the three different breads produced, especially in the sorghum bread. In addition, parboiled brown rice showed atypical pasting and rheological properties of the dough, which also affected the quality characteristics of the bread. The incorporation of 5% germinated millet enhanced breadcrumb softness in all samples, particularly for extruded rice flour added of germinated millet flour sample, which presented similar hardness values (7.3 N) and springiness (0.97) to whole wheat flour.

J		Concas, M. P.; Morgan, A.; Pelliccione, G.; Gasparini, P.; Girotto, G.							Genetics, odor perception and food liking: the intriguing role of cinnamon.		Food Quality and Preference					Humans use a repertoire of > 400 olfactory receptors (ORs) to perceive odorants. The sense of smell is a complex trait whereby genetics and environmental factors interplay. To date, still little is known regarding the genetics of smell, even though the high genetic variability of ORs genes has already been demonstrated. Recently a significant association between cinnamon odorant recognition and the rs317787 polymorphism, located in a cluster of OR genes, has been described. Based on this data, here, we replicated the effect of the same variant (rs317787) on cinnamon odorant identification as well as looked at any possible association with liking for wine whose bouquet frequently smells of cinnamon. Our analysis in a cohort of individuals from two Italian genetic isolates confirmed that rs317787-T allele is associated with an improved cinnamon detection (p-value 5.18*10-06, n = 971) but also with a greater liking for red wine (p-value 0.017, n = 2374). Present results further confirm the association of rs31778 SNP and cinnamon odorants detection and provide additional details about the role of the ORs genes in food liking. Overall, our work contributes to better deciphering the genetic basis of smell and food liking aimed at a more in-depth elucidation of the role of the ORs genes.

Food Chemistry					Maize (Zea mays L.) is one of the most versatile crops worldwide with high socioeconomic relevance. However, mycotoxins produced by pathogenic fungi are of constant concern in maize production, as they pose serious risks to human and animal health. Thus, the search for rapid detection and/or identification methods for mycotoxins and mycotoxin-producing fungi for application in food safety remain important. In this work, we implemented use of near infrared hyperspectral images (HSI-NIR) combined with pattern recognition analysis, partial-least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) of images, to develop a rapid method for identification of Fusarium verticillioides and F. graminearum. Validation of the HSI-NIR method and subsequent analysis was realized using 15 Fusarium spp. isolates. The method was efficient as a rapid, non-invasive, and non-destructive assessment was achieved with 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for both fungi.

Stuntz) fruit.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Maqui is a wild native berry from the Chilean and Argentinean Patagonia that is considered an important source of bioactive compounds for its high antioxidant activity and anthocyanin concentration. Processing methods that improve shelf-life can affect stability of antioxidant compounds. Furthermore, there is limited information of the processing effect on non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacity and quality of maqui-derived products. The aim of this work was to those characteristics on processed fruit using conventional canning (CC), convective forced hot air drying (CFHAD), osmotic drying (OD), and freeze-drying (FD). Ten non-anthocyanin phenolics were quantified using HPLC-MS. Luteolin-7-O-glucoside and hydroxycinnamic acid concentration showed a significant reduction by 45% when processed using CFHAD and OD. Rutin and hyperoside concentrations were significantly higher (24.76 mug/g and 100.20 mug/g) in FD maqui when compared to CC and OD treatments. CFHAD achieved the lowest water activity (0.41) and CC the highest total soluble solids content 28.00 °Brix. Antioxidant capacity of CC maqui samples showed a 17.6% decrease, while FD, CFHAD, and OD samples showed an average 21.8% increase. The results of this work can provide valuable information to functional food producers to determine optimal processing conditions to protect antioxidant compound of maqui.

J		Condict, L.; Hung, A.; Ashton, J.; Kasapis, S.							High-temperature binding parameters and molecular dynamics of 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and beta-casein complexes, determined via the method of continuous variation and fluorescence spectroscopy.		Food Hydrocolloids					Interactions between beta-casein and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA) were investigated following ultra-high temperature (UHT) treatment at 140 °C for 10 s. The aim of the work was to identify the binding strength, binding stoichiometry and type of molecular interactions between protein and bioactive compound. Molecular dynamics (MD) analysis shows that binding is stabilised by a wider variety of residues than is often indicated in simpler docking studies. Construction of Job plots via fluorescence quenching argues that beta-casein can accommodate two 4HBA molecules. This is in agreement with MD analysis, which demonstrates the stability of ligand in two different binding sites of the receptor. FTIR results indicate a binding interaction between the two components and UV-vis measurements record an increase in the absorption of 4HBA following UHT treatment in the presence of beta-casein. The latter observation argues that 4HBA may be bound covalently following heat treatment. This is further supported by MD simulations and quantum mechanics calculations that indicate one site has the potential for binding covalently to 4HBA via the lysine32 residue of the beta-casein molecule. This work addresses often overlooked issues in the determination of binding parameters, through the use of the method of continuous variation for the accurate determination of binding stoichiometry, as well as making use of a nonlinear fluorescence binding equation to account for the residual fluorescence of formed complexes. The findings give a broader understanding of the fate of bioactive ingredients in UHT treated beverage systems, allowing industry to make informed decisions on the inclusion of insoluble fibres and the impact of heat treatment on their products.

Food Research International					This study describes the characterization and genomic analysis of six lytic Salmonella phages. To examine the feasibility of using these phages as biocontrol agents, we analyzed their genomes and compared them to those of similar phages. These six phages belong to genus Epseptimavirus, family Demerecviridae. We identified the genes of these six phages by comparing their genomes with those of three type phages in subfamily Markadamsvirinae. All six phages examined in this study were obligately lytic and did not carry undesirable genes. Two phages (vB_SalS_1-23 and vB_SalS_3-29) were selected as the representative phages for general characterization and physiological tests. The biocontrol efficacy of the representative phages was determined by comparing the viable counts of recovered host Salmonella ser. Newlands ZC-S1 from treatment and phage-free control samples. The biocontrol experiment showed that the representative phages were able to reduce the counts of ZC-S1 to below 2 log10 CFU/mL (~4.3 log10 CFU/mL reduction) at 3 h post-infection at 37°C. Furthermore, we investigated the application of these two phages in the control of ZC-S1 contamination in chicken products and on eggshells. When applied to the surfaces of the samples, the phage cocktail (MOI = 100) reduced the ZC-S1 count to below 2 log10 CFU/mL on chicken skin and to undetectable levels (1 log10 CFU/mL) in chicken breast meat, ground chicken meat and eggshell samples (p< 0.01). Compared to the initial experiment, the phage cocktail reduced the ZC-S1 count by 2-4.08 log10 CFU/mL when applied at an MOI = 1 (except in the ground chicken meat group) and by 4.48-5.67 log10 CFU/mL at an MOI = 100 after 7 h. In conclusion, these two phages with lytic effects show a high potential to inhibit the growth of Salmonella contaminants and can be used as candidate biocontrol agents.

J		Cong Chen; Jun Mei; Jing Xie							Impact of thawing methods on physico-chemical properties and microstructural characteristics of concentrated milk.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study investigated the effects of different thawing methods on the physico-chemical properties and microstructural characteristics of pasteurized milk and concentrated milk. Four thawing methods including air thawing, flowing water thawing, microwave thawing, and ultrasonic thawing (UT) were individually used. The results showed that particle size and fat globules size of milk increased after thawing, but UT could improve these conditions. For the pasteurized milk, thawing process caused ethanol stability and heat stability degradation. Thawing decreased thermal stability of concentrated milk; however, no change was observed in ethanol stability. Secondary structures of proteins in both samples were also destroyed after thawing. The thawing method did not change pH values, but it would cause a small change in titratable acidity. Overall, the UT could maintain physico-chemical properties of pasteurized milk and concentrated milk better compared with other thawing treatments. Practical applications. Thawing is an essential step before processing or eating frozen food and can greatly affect the final quality of the frozen food. To our knowledge, no previous study has optimized the method of thawing milk and compared the effects of different thawing methods on milk. So, it is important to study the effect of the different thawing method on the quality of concentrated milk. Ultrasonic thawing can increase the physico-chemical properties of milk. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15642					FSTA:2022-01-Pa0076

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The deterioration of surface color Is a major factor limiting the marketability of fresh-cut stem lettuce. In this study, the impact of UV-C irradiation on fresh-cut stem lettuce was investigated. Slices were exposed to different doses (0, 1, 4, 8 or 12 kJ m-2) of UV-C light, then stored at 4 °C for 6 d. It was observed that all UV-C treatments could retard the occurrence of surface green fading and browning, and 8 kJ m-2 was determined as the optimal dose which used for further evaluation. Results. Showed that UV-C treatment decreased the degradation of chlorophyll, the loss of ascorbic acid (AsA) and the accumulation of phenolic compounds. Moreover, UV-C treatment did not show a distinct effect on activities of PPO and POD, but pronouncedly inhibited the activity of PAL. Based on this, the inhibited tissue browning upon application of UV-C should be mainly attributed to suppressed PAL activity. Additionally, the aroma data indicated that storage time was the main contributor to the changes of volatile components, whereas the impact of UV-C treatment was limited, especially in the first 4 d. These findings suggest that UV-C treatment has a potential practical application in preserving fresh-cut stem lettuce.

Meat Science					Although high level of purine in foods is considered a risk factor for hyperuricemia and gout, purine-rich foods continue to be popular for their delicious taste. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effects of purine bases on the sensory quality of pork. A total of 406 longissimus thoracis et lumborum samples were collected from a heterogeneous F6 pig population to determine purine composition and its correlation to sensory quality of pork. The contents of total purine and two major uricogenic bases (adenine and hypoxanthine) were negatively correlated with tenderness, juiciness, oiliness and overall liking (r<-0.2, P< 0.05), but they were not significantly correlated with umami. In contrast, guanine content, which accounts for only about 10% of the total purine content, was positively correlated with umami (r=0.15, P< 0.05), and had no significant relationships with other sensory indicators. These results imply that purine bases with different uricogenic effects also influence different sensory quality indices of pork.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Peanut milk benefits human health mainly due to its high protein content and suitable amino acid composition. To reveal the molecular mechanism affecting the quality of peanut milk, tandem mass tag (TMT)-labeled proteomic analysis was applied to identify the proteome variation between two peanut cultivars that produced peanut milk with the best and worst stability. Results. A total of 478 differentially abundant proteins (fold change > 1.2 or < 0.83, P< 0.05) were identified. Most of these proteins were located in the cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Correlation analysis showed that RNA recognition motif (RRM) domain-containing protein (17.1 kDa) had a negative relationship with the sedimentation rate of peanut milk and that 22.0 kDa class IV heat shock protein was negatively correlated with the creaming index (P< 0.05). Bioinformatic analysis showed that the molecular function of RRM domain-containing protein (17.1 kDa) was associated with RNA binding and nucleotide binding, and 22.0 kDa class IV heat shock protein was involved in the pathway of protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum. Conclusion. Overall, the differentially abundant proteins in the biological metabolic pathway might offer some potential markers to guide future peanut breeding, especially for the production of peanut milk. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	15	6424	6433	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11313					FSTA:2022-03-Js2551

Food Research International					This study aimed to evaluate the influence of spices on individual phospholipid molecules of water-boiled salted duck (WSD) processing. Shotgun lipidomics was used to determine the structure of individual phospholipid molecules in raw duck meat and changes of phospholipids in processed-WSD with or without spices. A total of 118 phospholipid molecules were determined during the whole processing. Spices had a significant effect on the changes of most individual phospholipid molecules during the processing, but the overall effect on the phospholipid profile was not obvious. Nine phospholipid molecule markers were screened by partial least squares discriminant analysis, which can be used to distinguish with or without spice treatment. The effect of spices on most phospholipid molecules began on the first day of dry-ripening, and gradually became more obvious in the subsequent processing. Spice's main function was to delay the degradation of individual phospholipid molecules.

Food & Function					Bile salt hydrolase (BSH)-producing bacteria are negatively related to the body weight gain and energy storage of the host. We aimed to obtain a novel BSH-producing strain with excellent anti-obesity effect and explained its mechanism. Here, we selected a strain named Lactiplantibacillus plantarum H-87 (H-87) with excellent ability to hydrolyze glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) and tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) in vitro from 12 lactobacilli, and evaluated its anti-obesity effect in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6J mice. The results suggested that H-87 could inhibit HFD-induced body weight gain, fat accumulation, liver lipogenesis and injury, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. In addition, H-87 could colonize in the ileum and hydrolyze GCDCA and TUDCA, reflected as changes in the concentrations of GCDCA, TUDCA, CDCA and UDCA in the ileum or liver. Furthermore, the study identified that H-87 reduced TUDCA and GCDCA levels in the ileum, which decreased the GLP-1 secretion by L cells to alleviate insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. Furthermore, H-87 increased the CDCA level in the ileum and liver to activate FXR signaling pathways to inhibit liver lipogenesis in HFD-fed mice. In addition, the decrease of intestinal conjugated bile acids (TUDCA and GCDCA) also increased fecal lipid content and decreased intestinal lipid digestibility. In conclusion, H-87 could inhibit liver fat deposition, insulin resistance and lipid digestion by changing bile acid enterohepatic circulation, and eventually alleviate HFD-induced obesity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	10	4315	4324	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00260k					FSTA:2021-09-Aj13661

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Obesity is a common disease worldwide and there is an urgent need for strategies to preventing obesity. Methods. And Results. The anti-obesity effect and mechanism of Ligilactobacillus salivarius LCK11 (LCK11) is studied using a C57BL/6J male mouse model in which obesity is induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). Results. Show that LCK11 can prevent HFD-induced obesity, reflected as inhibited body weight gain, abdominal and liver fat accumulation and dyslipidemia. Analysis of its mechanism shows that on the one hand, LCK11 can inhibit food intake through significantly improving the transcriptional and translational levels of peptide YY (PYY) in the rectum, in addition to the eventual serum PYY level; this is attributed to the activation of the toll-like receptor 2/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway in enteroendocrine L cells by the peptidoglycan of LCK11. On the other hand, LCK11 supplementation effectively reduces the Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes ratio and shifts the overall structure of the HFD-disrupted gut microbiota toward that of mice fed on a low-fat diet; this also contributes to preventing obesity. Conclusion. LCK11 shows the potential to be used as a novel probiotic for preventing obesity by both promoting PYY secretion to inhibit food intake and regulating gut microbiota. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	17			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100136					FSTA:2021-12-Ad18974

Food & Function					Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Researchers have shown that oxidative stress and apoptosis play an important role in the Parkinson's disease process. Isoquercitrin (quercetin-3-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside) is a natural flavonol compound and one of the main active ingredients of agricultural waste apple pomace. Increasing evidence indicates that this compound possesses anti-oxidation, anti-aging, and anti-inflammation properties. In this study, isoquercitrin was purified from apple pomace by high-speed countercurrent chromatography and its neuroprotective effect on Parkinson's disease was investigated in MPTP-induced acute mouse models. It was found that isoquercitrin ameliorated the animal behaviors against MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, mitigated the loss of dopamine neurons induced by MPTP, increased tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine transporter expression, reduced the pro-apoptotic signaling molecule bax expression and inhibited MPTP-triggered oxidative stress. Our results demonstrated that isoquercitrin has protective effects on the MPTP subacute model mouse, which might be partially mediated through the actions of anti-oxidation and anti-apoptosis. Isoquercitrin might be a new promising protective drug for the improvement of Parkinson's disease. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	13	6091	6101	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00843a					FSTA:2021-10-Je14085

Food & Function					Systemic injection with lipopolysaccharide can lead to depressive-like behavior in experimental animals by inducing neuroinflammation and is considered to be a classic model of depression. S-equol is a major metabolite of dietary soy isoflavones with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, and it has many beneficial effects on human health, including alleviation of menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis, cancer, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive dysfunction. A recent study reported that S-equol inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated neuroinflammation in astrocytes. However, there is no research on the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the antidepressant-like effects of S-equol in a lipopolysaccharide-induced depression model in mice and explore its underlying mechanisms. Our results demonstrated that treatment with S-equol (10, 20 and 40 mg kg-1) for 19 days markedly reversed the behavior of acute LPS (1.0 mg kg-1) treated mice in sucrose preference, tail suspension and forced swimming tests, exerting antidepressant-like effects. In addition, S-equol administration significantly decreased the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-10, interleukin-1beta), increased the levels of 5-hydroxytryptamine and norepinephrine, and normalized the release of tryptophan and kynurenine in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. Moreover, treatment with S-equol significantly up-regulated the expression of synaptic plasticity-related proteins (phospho synapsin, synapsin, postsynaptic density-95) and down-regulated the toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor kappa B signaling pathway in the hippocampi of lipopolysaccharide-treated mice. These findings demonstrated that S-equol significantly alleviated the depressive-like behavior induced by acute systemic injection of LPS, and its antidepressant action was related to mediation of neuroinflammation via the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway, normalization of the monoamine neurotransmitter levels, reversal of tryptophan metabolism dysfunction, and enhancement of synaptic plasticity. The current study provides insight into the potential of S-equol in the prevention of depression. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	13	5770	5778	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00547b					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14956

Optimization of enzymatic hydrolysis of collagen from yellowfin tuna skin (Thunnus albacares) by response surface methodology and properties of hydrolyzed collagen.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Response surface methodology was used to optimize hydrolysis conditions of collagen from yellowfin tuna skin (Thunnus albacares) for maximizing the degree of hydrolysis (DH) and nitrogen recovery efficiency (NR). The results showed that the optimum hydrolysis parameters were at 54.7 °C and pH 8 with 0.034 AU/g alcalase concentration for 5.2 hr. The predicted DH and NR under optimal conditions were validated and confirmed as 24.51% and 96.35%, respectively. The obtained collagen hydrolysate (CH) was rich in proline, glycine, methionine, and hydroxyproline residues. The antioxidation and antifreezing activity of CH were identified as 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical activity (IC50 77.04 g/ml), and hydroxyl radical activity (IC50 36.59 g/ml). It also exhibited antifreezing property and had the inhibition rate of peroxide value of oil up to 73.53%. The results suggested that CH from yellowfin tuna skin could be used in the production of functional food products or other related industries. Practical applications. Due to its low solubility, collagen has limited applications in industry. This study aimed to optimize the hydrolysis conditions of the collagen from yellowfin tuna skin in order to apply in industry. The collagen hydrolysate which is rich in proline, glycine, methionine, and hydroxyproline residues has excellent antioxidant, antifreezing, and antioxidation properties. Collagen hydrolysate can be used in the production of food and functional food products or other related industries due to excellent antioxidant and antifreezing properties, and good inhibition rate of oil oxidation. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15319					FSTA:2021-08-Rc2829

Food Hydrocolloids					A polysaccharide component (SQAP-2) was isolated from quinoa by alkaline extraction and purified with DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 column chromatography. The chemical structure of the polysaccharide was characterized, and the impact on antioxidant activity was evaluated. Polysaccharide SQAP-2 (2.02*103 Da) is a type of glucose whose glycosidic bond Glc-(1, 4)-Glcp-(1, 4,6)-Glcp-(1 linkages were identified through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkage content, and a suggestion of the structural formula was provided. Their radical scavenging capacity was evaluated, and scavenging activity against DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl, superoxide radicals, and ferric reducing ability exhibited excellent radical scavenging activities of approximately 21.711.25%, 49.461.59%, 70.103.39%, 70.492.09%, 51.251.16%, respectively, at 3 mg/mL. The isolated quinoa polysaccharides could represent an antioxidant agent once the structural features and antioxidant activities are definitively characterized.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					For a long time, the abuse of antibiotics and the excessive use of synthetic preservatives have caused harm to human health. Bacteriocins produced by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are nontoxic and exhibit potential as natural preservatives. In this experiment, the bacteriocin 1.0320 produced by Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 screened from traditional koumiss was used as the research object. The main purpose of the experiment was to purify bacteriocin 1.0320 and study its antimicrobial mechanism. Bacteriocin 1.0320 exhibited antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Bacteriocin 1.0320 in cell-free fermentation supernatant (CFS) was purified by ethyl acetate extraction and anion exchange chromatography. The molecular mass of bacteriocin 1.0320 was 1-3.3 KDa as assessed by dialysis and Tricine sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Tricine-SDS-PAGE). The minimum inhibitory concentration of bacteriocin 1.0320 on E scherichia coli UB1005 was 0.072 mg/mL. Bacteriocin 1.0320 can form pores on the surface of cell membrane, increase the permeability of cell membrane, dissipate the cytoplasmic membrane potential and transmembrane pH gradient, and destroy the integrity of cell membrane, causing cell content to flow out and cell death. The effect is related to the concentration of bacteriocin 1.0320. This information provides the theoretical basis for the antimicrobial mechanism of L. rhamnosus bacteriocin.

J		Cong Zhao; Wenlai Fan; Yan Xu							Characterization of key aroma compounds in pixian broad bean paste through the molecular sensory science technique.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The Pixian broad bean paste (PBBP) is widely welcomed by consumers in China due to its unique aroma. The objective of this study was to characterize the key aroma of PBBP. The aromas of PBBP were fractionated by normal phase-liquid chromatography (NP-LC) and detected and identified by gas chromatography-olfactory (GC-O) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and quantitated by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE). The results showed that 58 aroma-active compounds were identified in PBBP, of which acids and phenolics had the highest concentration, and 39 odorants were demonstrated as important odorants. Besides, aroma recombination tests and statistical analysis showed that the original PBBP and recombinant have no significant difference in sweat/sour, roasted, and floral attributes, proving that this study successfully simulated the typical aroma of PBBP. The omission tests demonstrated 4-ethylguaiacol and 4-vinylguaiacol as the key odorants and revealed the significance of sotolon, 4-hydroxy-2,5-dimethyl-3 (2 H)-furanone (HDMF), the entire class of phenolics, and the entire class of acids, particularly acetic acid, 3-methylbutanoic acid, 4-methylpentanoic acid may have a synergistic effect, for the overall aroma of the PBBP.

J		Cong-Cong Qiao; Fan-Kun Zeng; Na-Na Wu; Bin Tan							Functional, physicochemical and structural properties of soluble dietary fiber from rice bran with extrusion cooking treatment.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of extrusion cooking treatment with different parameters (when the screw speed was 250 rpm/min and the material moisture was 17 %, the extrusion cooking temperature were 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C, 160 °C, 180 °C, respectively; when the screw speed was 250 rpm/min and the extrusion cooking temperature was 160 °C, the material moisture were 11 %, 14 %, 17 %, 20 %, 23 %, respectively) on the functional, physicochemical and structural properties of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) from rice bran were investigated. The water and oil retention capacity (WRC and ORC), water solubility (WS), in vitro binding capacities (bile salt, cholesterol and glucose binding capacity) and antioxidant capacities of SDF were higher when extrusion cooking temperatures were 100 °C and 120 °C. The in vitro binding capacities and antioxidant capacities of SDF were higher when material moisture contents were 11 % and 14 %. However, the ORC, in vitro binding capacities and antioxidant capacities decreased when extrusion cooking temperature was higher than 140 °C and material moisture was higher than 14 %. The results of FT-IR spectrum indicated that the structure of SDF from rice bran was changed after extrusion cooking treatment. The extrusion cooking treatment at low temperature and low material moisture was more beneficial to the properties of SDF. This study may provide basic information for the utilization of SDF from rice bran with extrusion cooking treatment.

Journal of Dairy Science					Mammalian lignans are phytoestrogens with important bioactivities, and their concentrations in livestock milk may influence the health of consumers. This research aimed to establish a method to quantify multiple mammalian lignans in the biofluids of dairy sheep using ultra-HPLC-triple quadropole mass spectrometry with multiple-reaction monitoring. Secoisolariciresinol, 2-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-3-[(3-hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-1,4-butanediol, enterodiol (ED), enterolactone (EL), ED-sulfate (ED-S), and EL-sulfate (EL-S) were purified from the urine of flaxseed cake-fed dairy sheep. The structures of these lignans were identified by a combination of mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. These purified lignans were used as standards to optimize their quantification conditions in urine, milk, and plasma of dairy sheep. On this basis, the lignan metabolites in biofluids were quantified. To improve analysis sensitivity, plasma and milk were pretreated with acetonitrile containing 1% formic acid and passed through a HybridSPE-PL 55261-U column (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). The limit of quantification of the lignans ranged from 1.43 to 18.3 ng/mL in plasma, and from 1.01 to 18.7 ng/mL in milk. The linearity of the calibration curves ranged from their limit of quantification to at least 217 ng/mL in plasma, and 217 ng/mL in milk. Regression coefficient of the calibration curves were above 0.99 for secoisolariciresinol, 2-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl) methyl]-3-[(3-hydroxyphenyl) methyl]-1,4-butanediol, ED, EL, ED-S, and EL-S, indicating satisfactory relationships between the peak areas and concentrations in the quantification range. The relative concentrations of ED-glucuronide and EL-glucuronide (EL-G) in different biofluids were compared based on their chromatogram peak areas. The sheep plasma contained all forms of mammalian lignans (i.e., ED, EL, ED-S, EL-S, ED-glucuronide, and EL-G.); the urine contained ED, EL, ED-S, and EL-S; and the milk contained ED, EL, ED-S, EL-S, and EL-G. Milk-to-plasma concentration ratios of the mammalian lignans indicated that the free forms were more permeable than the sulfated conjugates. Mammalian lignans found in sheep plasma and milk may provide health benefits to the sheep and sheep-product consumers. The analytical method established in this work could be used to quantify mammalian lignans in livestock products.

Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Salmonella Enteritidis is an important foodborne pathogen with high prevalence of resistance to cephalosporins, imposing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, a total of 162 Salmonella Enteritidis isolates collected from child patients in China from 2007 to 2017 were characterized for their resistance to cephalosporins and investigated the transmission characteristics of cephalosporin resistance gene. We found that 15 (9.26%) isolates were all resistant to cefalotin (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥512mug/mL), ceftazidime (MIC 16-128mug/mL), ceftriaxone (MIC 64 to ≥512mug/mL), ceftiofur (MIC 64-256mug/mL), and cefotaxime (MIC 64 to ≥512mug/mL) with the possession of cephalosporin resistance genes blaCTX-M-55 (n=13), blaCTX-M-101 (n=1), and blaCTX-M-153 (n=1). Molecular typing further revealed that these 15 isolates belonged to sequence type ST11 and shared close pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns, suggesting the possibility of clonal spread in Salmonella Enteritidis interspecies. Furthermore, conjugation experiments were successfully performed in 13 of 15 isolates, and blaCTX-M-55 was present on conjugative plasmids with sizes ranging from 54.7 to 173.4kb. Compared with recipient Escherichia coli C600, transconjugants conferred elevated MICs for cephalosporins ranging from 2- to 2048-fold. The genetic structure surrounding of blaCTX-M-55 gene in transconjugants were DeltaIS Ecp1-blaCTX-M-55-orf477 (n=8) and IS Ecp1-blaCTX-M-55-orf477 (n=3), respectively. Taken together, blaCTX-M on the plasmids might contribute to cephalosporin resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis, and conjugative transfer of blaCTX-M-55 might facilitate the spread of cephalosporin resistance in Salmonella Enteritidis. Hence, effective mitigation measurements are needed to reduce the threat caused by cephalosporin-resistant Salmonella Enteritidis to public health.										2021	18	10	702	711	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2878					FSTA:2022-02-Cd0372

Journal of Functional Foods					A capsaicin delivery system was developed by self-assembling of alpha-lactalbumin polypeptides into nanomicelles. The capsaicin was loaded into the alpha-lactalbumin micelles via hydrophobic interaction with an embedding amount of 126.58 mg/g. Steatotic HepG2 cells were treated with the capsaicin-loaded nanomicelles and the anti-lipogenesis effect of the cells was significantly improved. The endocytosis rate of capsaicin was improved by nanomicelles. Moreover, the nanomicelles could escape from lysosomes and overcome P-glycoprotein efflux pump effect, which prevented the capsaicin being pumped out of cells. Furthermore, the capsaicin-loaded nanomicelles showed a deep penetration and anti-lipogenesis effect on steatotic HepG2 spheroid model. Western blotting results suggested that the capsaicin-loaded nanomicelles remarkably inhibited lipogenesis, promoted lipid hydrolysis and macro-autophagy compared with free capsaicin. The present study suggested that the alpha-lactalbumin nanocarriers exhibited a considerable potential in delivery of hydrophobic bioactive ingredients into cells effectively and maximized their bioactivities in functional foods.

J		Congde Qiao; Xujie Wang; Jianlong Zhang; Jinshui Yao							Influence of salts in the Hofmeister series on the physical gelation behavior of gelatin in aqueous solutions.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of various inorganic salts on the physical gelation behavior of the gelatin solutions was investigated by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer, polarimeter, rheometer, X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. It was found that strongly hydrated anions, such as SO42- and H2PO4-, facilitated the gelation of the biopolymer solutions, evidenced by the increases of the length and content of triple helices. On the contrary, weak hydrated anions like Cl- and SCN-hindered the coil-helix transition of gelatin. Additionally, the gelling temperature (Tgel) of protein was directly correlated to the hydration entropy of anions, demonstrating that the elevation of Tgel was attributed to the strong hydration effect of kosmotropic anions. On the other hand, chaotropic anions lowered Tgel, due to the direct interactions of weak hydrated anions with polypeptide backbones which were confirmed by the FTIR results. These observations indicate that the gel structure can be modulated by Hofmeister salts.

J		Congde Qiao; Xianguang Ma; Xujie Wang; Libin Liu							Structure and properties of chitosan films: effect of the type of solvent acid.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The properties of chitosan films can be modified by changing the solvent type, attributing to the different interaction patterns between chitosan and acids. However, little is known about how these interactions affect the structure and properties of chitosan films. In this work, the influence of acid type on the structure and properties of chitosan films was studied by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FTIR spectra showed that the ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding could occur between chitosan and acid ions. Structural analysis revealed that chitosan was partially crystalline in hydrochloric and acetic acid films, whereas it was amorphous in lactic and citric acid films. DSC result indicated that the glass transition temperature of chitosan was much lower in citric acid film with low water content than in all the other films, suggesting that the citrate ions interacted more strongly with chitosan. A melting transition appeared in hydrochloric and acetic acid films. In addition, the tensile strength of these films decreased with an increase in the volume of acid. These observations indicate that the choice of a proper solvent for chitosan may be desirable for certain special applications.

J		Conghui Liu; Xin Wang							The physicochemical properties and stability of flaxseed oil emulsions: effects of emulsification methods and the ratio of soybean protein isolate to soy lecithin.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The properties and stability of emulsion rely greatly on the emulsification method and emulsifier. In this study, different emulsification methods (high-speed homogenization, ultrasonic treatment and their combination) were employed for the preparation of emulsions stabilized by soybean protein isolate (SPI) and soy lecithin (SLT) at three ratios. The microstructure, hydrodynamic average diameter, zeta-potential, creaming stability and low-field nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation behaviors of emulsions were investigated. Results. The results indicated that the influence of emulsification method was closely related to the ratio of SPI/SLT. Overall, the SPI-SLT-stabilized emulsion treated by ultrasound showed better stability and uniformity, while the combined treatment of high-speed homogenization and ultrasound was helpful in improving the uniformity and stability of SPI-stabilized Pickering emulsion. However, the SLT-stabilized emulsions all exhibited worse uniformity in terms of particle size distribution and polydispersity index. Conclusion. These results will be helpful for selecting an appropriate emulsification method and emulsifier to improve the stability of emulsions. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	15	6407	6416	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11311					FSTA:2022-03-Gg0949

Food Research International					In this study, H2O2-Vc (hydrogen peroxide-ascorbic acid) oxidation system under 50 and 70 °C was developed to degrade blue honeysuckle polysaccharides. The results suggested that viscosity-average molecular weight was decreased and reducing sugar content was raised with the rise of time or temperature. The degradation was fitted to the second-order reaction kinetics. The gas chromatography revealed two degraded polysaccharides were consisted of six monosaccharides (Gal A, Rha, Ala, Gal, Glu, Man) with different ratios, and eight types of sugar residues were confirmed using nuclear magnetic resonance. Based on the linearity (R1), branching (R2), branch size (R3) calculation, PD70 (purified degraded polysaccharide at 70 °C) had a more linear structure and longer side chains comparing to PD50 (purified degraded polysaccharide at 50 °C). The absence of triple helical structure and sheet-like aggregation with rough surface were confirmed by the Congo red test and scanning electron. Rheological characterization proved the two degraded polysaccharides exhibited shear-thinning behavior and viscoelastic property. Besides, the two degraded polysaccharides displayed strong antiglycation activities, inhibitory effects against alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, and exhibited competitive inhibitory kinetics. These findings support the potential application of blue honeysuckle polysaccharides as the treatment of diabetes.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Tibetan hulless barley (qingke) is an important food crop in the Tibetan plateau. However, it often suffers from drought stress resulting in reduction of food production because of the extreme plateau environment. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the drought resistance of qingke, the transcriptomic and metabolomic responses of drought-sensitive (D) and drought-resistant (XL) accessions were characterized in experiments with a time course design. The phenylpropanoid pathway was reprogrammed by downregulating the lignin pathway and increasing the biosynthesis of flavonoids and anthocyanins, and this regulation improved plant tolerance for drought stress. Besides, flavonoid glycosides have induced accumulation of metabolites that participated in drought stress resistance. HVUL7 H11410 exhibited the activity of wide-spectrum glucosyltransferase and mediated flavonoid glycosylation to enhance drought stress resistance. Overall, the findings provide insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying drought stress tolerance associated with metabolic reprogramming. Furthermore, the flavonoid-enriched qingke is more tolerant to drought stress and can be used as a functional food to benefit human health.										2021	69	13	3992	4005	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07810					FSTA:2021-08-Ma4484

Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry predicts lamb carcass composition at abattoir chain speed with high repeatability across varying processing factors.		Meat Science					An on-line Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scanner was used in an Australian abattoir to predict computed tomography (CT) determined composition% of fat, lean muscle and bone in lamb carcasses at chain speed. This study assessed the effect of spray-chilling on these estimates, as well as their repeatability over a 10-min period, and over a 72 h period. There was no prediction bias between the 15 spray-chilled and 15 non-spray-chilled carcasses. When repeat DEXA scans were undertaken across a 10-min period, there was a high level of repeatability for the prediction of CT Fat%. When repeat scans were conducted at 6 time points across a 72 h period the precision of the DXA prediction of CT Fat% of 30 carcasses remained high (R2 = 0.94, RMSEP = 1.20%), although small biases existed between time points (P < 0.01). These biases were minimised when the DXA scanner had been operational prior to experimentation, suggesting a "warm-up" effect. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Generation of phenolic-rich extracts from brewers' spent grain and characterisation of their in vitro and in vivo activities.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Brewers' spent grain (BSG) is a co-product of the brewing industry, which is rich in phenolic acids. This study compared the in vitro bioactive properties of aqueous, aqueous pH-shift and enzyme-aided phenolic extracts from pale (unroasted) wet BSG. Overall, the pH-shift extracts showed higher oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC), trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) values compared with the enzyme-aided extracts. A selected enzyme-aided extract showed highest in vitro ACE inhibitory activity (ACE IC50: 0.1330.032 mg mL-1) and mediated significant (p< 0.05) reductions in blood pressure markers in vivo following ingestion by spontaneously hypertensive rats (systolic blood pressure;-35.359.04 and diastolic blood pressure;-28.554.22 mmHg). The results demonstrated that the observed in vitro activity of phenolic-rich extracts may be translated into an in vivo hypotensive effect. Enzyme-assisted extraction has potential as an alternative solvent-free approach for generating phenolic-rich extracts from BSG that may find use in the management of hypertension.

Chemical QR Code: a simple and disposable paper-based optoelectronic nose for the identification of olive oil odor.		Food Chemistry					Olive oil is an appreciated food product with high nutritional value, besides being an essential component in many culture diets. In this study, we present for the first time the application of a simple and non-invasive paper-based optoelectronic nose designed in a QR code configuration to evaluate the odor of olive oils. The chemical QR code was fabricated by the addition of 12 dyes, which provided high dimensional data resulting from the interaction between the volatile compounds and the colorimetric array. The color changes were employed to build differential maps with a unique fingerprint (i) to discriminate between olive oil and other edible oil samples; (ii) to quantify nonanaldehyde as an oxidation marker; and (iii) to identify oxidized oils through principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical component analysis (HCA).

Meat Science					The aim of this study was to explore the use of TD-NMR relaxometry and 1H NMR spectroscopy-based for detecting differences in meat quality attributes. There was limited association between various TD-NMR signals and any physicochemical parameters of fresh and aged meat differing in tenderness ratings. Samples were then divided into three groups based on statistical changes in metabolite concentration. Group A samples possessed near linear increases in metabolite concentration over aging time; whereas samples assigned to Groups B and C were characterized by increases in metabolites that peaked between 7 and 14 days, and up to 14 days aging, respectively. 1H NMR spectroscopy discriminated meat quality using changes in metabolites reflective of glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, protein degradation, amino acid generation and purine metabolisms.

Preliminary study on the characterization of Longissimus lumborum dark cutting meat in Angus * Nellore crossbreed cattle using NMR-based metabolomics.		Meat Science					The aim of this preliminary study was to evaluate meat quality properties, muscle metabolite profile and metabolic pathways associated with the occurrence of dark cutting meat in Angus x Nellore crossbreed cattle. After 14days' ageing, dark cutting meat presented a higher pH, lower cooking loss and colour parameters, and greater tenderness compared with normal meat. Dark cutting meat had a higher ATP level and lower concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate, lactate, glucose, serine, threonine, creatine phosphate, inosine, leucine, methionine, succinate and glucose-1-phosphate compared to normal meat. In dark cutting samples, the ultimate pH was positively correlated with carnitine and negatively correlated with glucose-6-phosphate. However, in normal meat, the ultimate pH presented a positive correlation with arginine, leucine, methionine, proline, threonine, tyrosine and valine. Pathway analysis showed that differentiation of the groups was linked to energetic pathways such as starch and sucrose metabolism, the pentose phosphate pathway, amino sugar, nucleotide sugar metabolism, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. In conclusion, the occurrence of dark cutting meat has a notable impact on meat quality attributes and concentrations of post-mortem glycolytic metabolites, appears to be correlated with mitochondrial activity and affects energetic metabolic pathways.

Polymers and protein-associated vesicles for the microencapsulation of anthocyanins from grape skins used for food applications.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Anthocyanins were extracted from grape skins by a combination of ethanolic-ultrasonic assisted methods and were then encapsulated by freeze-drying in soy phosphatidylcholine vesicles with the addition of different polymers, such as pectin, acacia gum, and whey protein isolate. The goal of this research was to microencapsulate anthocyanin compounds extracted from grape skins, to characterize the stability and behavior of the vesicles and then to use them to obtain a new light formulated mayonnaise. Results. The particle size ranged from 900nm in the control condition to 250nm in vesicles loaded with whey proteins. The powders showed higher encapsulation efficiency for all variants, ranging from 81 to 96%. Vibrational spectroscopy revealed better inclusion of anthocyanins in polysaccharide-based coacervates, whereas in protein-based coacervates a possible interaction of anthocyanins with amine groups was observed. The vesicles were tested for in vitro release, and the results confirmed the gradual release of the anthocyanins in both stages of digestion, with a residual content of about 50% in the vesicles. The powders displayed high stability during storage in the dark at 4 °C. The panelists appreciated the new light formulated mayonnaises enriched with 10% dried vesicles compared with the control sample, in particular samples with acacia gum. Conclusion. The study revealed that polymer-loaded vesicles presented stability in simulated gastrointestinal fluids and have proved successful in obtaining new light enriched mayonnaises. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Food Chemistry					A multi-residue method for the simultaneous analysis of a wide range of pesticides in raisins using liquid and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS) has been validated. Pesticides are extracted from raisins with ethyl acetate, followed by centrifugation. The validation study was in accordance with DG SANTE guidelines. Validation experiments have been performed in both analytical instruments. A total number of 314 pesticides were spiked in raisins of organic farming at two spiking levels for GC-MS/MS (0.025 and 0.1 mg/kg), and at three spiking levels for LC-MS/MS (0.005, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) with 6 replicates at each concentration. The scope of validation included linearity, limits of quantification (LOQ), accuracy, precision, and matrix effects (%) for each pesticide. The validated method was then applied for the analysis of 37 commercial raisin samples purchased from the market. For the evaluation of the results, processing factors (PFs) have been applied to derive the amount of residue in raisins, from the maximum residue levels (MRLs) of grapes, and which in this paper will be referred as to the MRL expressed in raisins. In all conventional samples, pesticides were detected at concentrations above the LOQ. In total, 55 different pesticides were detected. All conventional samples contained multiple pesticides ranging from 2 to 24. On the other hand, samples from organic farming were found to be free of the analysed pesticides. The 13.5% of the examined samples were considered as violations. The exposure assessment for the acute risk of the violating samples indicated that no potential risk derives from the detected and approved in the EU pesticides, while the detection of not approved pesticides in the EU, and the lack of toxicological reference values for certain pesticides raise concerns for the human health, especially for children. The results of the survey study indicate the need to include processed samples, and in particular dry fruits with a high consumption rate such as raisins, in the official controls of pesticide residues in food.

J		Consumi, M.; Leone, G.; Tamasi, G.; Magnani, A.							Water content quantification by FTIR in carboxymethyl cellulose food additive.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Water content quantification of raw polysaccharide materials for food processing is generally performed by gravimetric analysis or titrimetric methods, which are time-and energy-consuming, non-eco-friendly and sample destructive. The present study develops and validates a new approach, based on the use of Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, resulting in a model of the water content of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polysaccharides. Samples of CMC were exposed to different relative humidity conditions. Water content was determined by standard gravimetric methods (OIV-Oeno 404-2010) and compared with the area of FTIR absorption in the range 3675-2980 cm-1, attributed to the stretching of OH groups. The strong correlation between gravimetric results and FTIR area (R2 = 0.88) showed no signs of bias across the water content range. A cross-validation technique to predict the water content by band area was assessed obtaining a general equation: y = 2.12 x + 2.80 with a high repetitively and good prediction of the tested models. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Physico-chemical and sensory qualities of Iberian sliced dry-cured loins from various commercial categories and the effects of the type of packaging and refrigeration time.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The physico-chemical characteristics and sensory attributes of Iberian sliced dry-cured loin from three commercial categories according to the current Spanish Iberian Quality Standard (Black, Red; purebred Iberian and Iberian x Duroc-crossed (50%) pigs, respectively, reared outdoor with the final fattening phase based on acorns and grass; Montanera, and White; Iberian x Duroc crossed (50%) pigs reared indoors and fed on commercial fodder) and packaged using different systems (vacuum and modified-atmosphere packaging, MAP) were evaluated at various stages throughout their long-term storage (12 months). The slices from the Black and Red categories yielded higher antioxidants, monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids and higher lipid oxidation at the end of storage time (from t8 to t12). alpha-tocopherol was better preserved in the case of the slices kept in MAP although, after 8 months of storage, lipid oxidation was seen to increase in the latter (Deltat12-t0 MAP = 0.4) compared to the vacuum packaged product. Regarding sensory evaluation, the marbling and texture attributes were affected by commercial category, whereas the influence was insignificant by type of packaging and storage time.

J		Conte, F.; Cincotta, F.; Condurso, C.; Verzera, A.; Panebianco, A.							Odor emissions from raw meat of freshly slaughtered cattle during inspection.		Foods					Raw meat of Freshly Slaughtered Cattle (FSC) is characterized by a very weak odor defined as slightly sweet, which could interfere in off-odor assessment during post-mortem inspection by an official veterinarian. Despite this, no information is reported in the literature on the volatiles which are emitted by FSC meat. Thus, this research aimed to study the volatile profile of raw cattle meat at different times within 24 h of slaughtering. Volatiles were analyzed and quantified using HS-SPME-GC-MS. gamma-Butyrolactone, acetoin, and to a lesser extent, acid acetic were found to be the odor-active compounds of raw meat from freshly slaughtered cattle. Quantitative differences were observed up to 24 h; since the lowest levels of the odor-active compounds were reached between two and three hours from slaughtering, this period could be the most suitable for the post-mortem inspection process. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Conte, P.; Cinquanta, L.; Meo, P. L.; Mazza, F.; Micalizzi, A.; Corona, O.							Fast field cycling NMR relaxometry as a tool to monitor Parmigiano Reggiano cheese ripening.		Food Research International					It is widely recognized that the longer the ageing, the more valuable Parmigiano Reggiano (PR) cheese becomes, due to the improvement of its sensorial and nutritional properties. Up to now, the evaluation of PR properties has been performed on samples mainly aged up to 40 months. For this reason, this study was aimed at collecting information about the chemical-physical characteristics of PR cheeses after ageing at 24,48 and 84 months. The basic analyses on water amount, protein content and volatile organic compounds (VOC) revealed that PR ageing is associated to the decomposition of the organic components into smaller units. This drives water molecules closer to the aforementioned units, thereby leading to a reduction of water activity. Moreover, it appears, from VOC investigation, that either the total amount of long chain fatty acids (LCFA) or the sole 9Z-octadecenoic acid considerably increased with PR aging, thereby making these molecular systems good fingerprint to monitor PR ripening. Fast field cycling (FFC) NMR relaxometry revealed different components of the molecular dynamics in the complex PR cheese samples, which were attributed to water trapped in casein micelles, water bound to polar groups in organic components, proteins, and fats. In particular, the reduction of the correlation times associated to the organic components was explained by the molecular size decrement following degradation processes. The ageing-independent component of the motion was assigned to water molecules bound to polar groups in organic moieties. Finally, the ageing-independent contribution to the overall relaxation rate was assigned to water molecules in casein micelles. This study revealed that FFC NMR relaxometry can be a promising technique to monitor the chemical physical changes during Parmigiano Reggiano cheese ripening. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Gluten-free breadsticks fortified with phenolic-rich extracts from olive leaves and olive mill wastewater.		Foods					Nowadays, food processing by-products, which have long raised serious environmental concerns, are recognized to be a cheap source of valuable compounds. In the present study, incorporation of phenolic-rich extracts (500 and 1000 mg kg-1) from olive leaves (OL) and olive mill wastewater (OMW) into conventional gluten-free formulations has been exploited as a potential strategy for developing nutritious and healthy breadsticks with extended shelf-life. To this end, moisture, water activity (aw), visual and textural properties, the composition of biologically active compounds (soluble, insoluble, and bio-accessible polyphenols), antioxidant activity, oxidation stability, and consumer preference of the resulting breadsticks were investigated. Fortified breadsticks had higher moisture and aw, lower hardness, and similar color in comparison to the control, especially in the case of OL extract supplementation. All enriched formulations significantly affected the phenolic composition, as evidenced by the decrease in insoluble/soluble polyphenols ratio (from 7 in the control up to 3.1 and 4.5 in OL and OMW, respectively), and a concomitant increase in polyphenol bio-accessibility (OL: 14.5-23% and OMW: 10.4-15% rise) and antioxidant activity (OL: 20-36% and OMW: 11-16% rise). Moreover, a significant shelf-life extension was observed in all fortified breadsticks (especially in case of OMW supplementation). Sensory evaluation evidenced that 61% of the assessors showed a marked, but not significant, tendency to consider the sample supplemented with high levels of OL as a more palatable choice. © 2021 by the authors.

The effects of feeding finishing pigs of two genders with a high fiber and high fat diet on muscle glycolytic potential at slaughter and meat quality.		Meat Science					A total of 160 pigs, in groups of 8 pigs of mixed genders, were fed four finishing feeding strategies with the aim to reduce muscle glycolytic potential and improve meat quality. Pigs were fed a control diet (C; fat=5.0%, ADF=3.0%, NDF=8.8%), a high-fat and high-fiber diet (HFF; fat=11.2%, ADF=9.1%, NDF=19.5%), a blend of 50-50% C and HFF diets (fat=8.2%, ADF=6.7%, NDF=14.2%) or the C diet and transferred to the HFF diet after a diet transition. Dietary treatments alone or in interaction with gender had no effect on pig growth performance, carcass quality traits, Longissimus and Semimembranosus muscle glycolytic potential and meat quality (P>0.10). The inefficiency of the dietary treatments applied in this study may be due to the low ratio between fat and digestible carbohydrate in the diets combined with the mild pre-slaughter stress conditions pigs were exposed to.

Bioactive compounds in legumes: implications for sustainable nutrition and health in the elderly population.		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. Food production represents one of the highest impacting activities on our planet, significantly contributing to climate change. Agriculture is one of the most important drivers of these changes since farming, forestry, and livestock, emit approximately one third of the global total CO2. Moreover, the modern agriculture systems mainly focus on starchy vegetables leading to energy dense and nutrient poor dietary patterns related to chronic diseases, such as NCDs. Elderly are the most vulnerable population portion that experiences even more than others the impact of unhealthy dietary patterns. Therefore, a transition to healthier and more sustainable solutions must be adopted to reach the SDGs promoted by the Agenda 2030, positively impacting the environment and human health. The role of pulses in this context is discussed. Scope and approach. Authors focus on the role of Leguminosae considering their potential impact both on health in the ageing population as well as on agri-food chains sustainability. Key findings and conclusions. there is an increasing awareness on how legumes represent an important source of bioactive compounds (i.e., phenolics, saponins and peptides) with a wide range of healthy activities, all of which share antioxidant properties, essential to prevent or delay oxidative stress and disease in elderly population. With an ever-ageing population at the global level, healthy ageing is an emerging public health priority for securing citizens' quality of life and minimizing healthcare associated costs.

Efficacy of mild thermal and pulsed light treatments, individually applied or in combination, for maintaining postharvest quality of strawberry cv. Albion.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effect of mild thermal (TT) and pulsed light (PL) treatments, individually applied or in combination, on fungal spoilage, mechanical properties, weight loss, and microstructure of strawberries (cv. Albion) stored at 5 °C was evaluated. TT (2.5 and 5.0 min in water at 460.4 °C) was more effective than PL (fluence: 11.9 J/cm2) to reduce fungal decay. TT for 5 min delayed the onset of infection for 6 days and maintained the lowest percentage of infected fruit along storage, showing the best performance among the strategies evaluated. Combined treatments did not achieve greater fungal inhibition than individual TT. Non significant differences in weight loss among control and treated fruit were observed up to 8 days of storage. TT for 5 min and its combination with PL significantly enhanced firmness, stiffness, and resistance to deformation as compared to untreated fruit, in concordance with the reinforcement of cell walls. Practical applications. This work aimed to compare the effect of mild thermal and pulsed light treatments, individually applied or in combination, on strawberries storage life. The evaluation of the impact of these technologies on selected quality parameters (fungal growth, weight loss, and mechanical properties) and their correlation with modifications at microstructure level, would contribute to the selection of postharvest strategies for prolonging the shelf life of strawberries. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Contreras, M.; Benedito, J.; Garcia-Perez, J. V.							Ultrasonic characterization of salt, moisture and texture modifications in dry-cured ham during post-salting.		Meat Science					For the first time, this study addresses the use of non-destructive ultrasound to monitor ham post-salting. For that purpose, the ultrasonic velocity (1 MHz) and the weight loss of hams were measured regularly every 2 days up to 8 weeks after salting. Additionally, for different post-salting times, internal salt and moisture content and hardness were measured at different locations from the ham surface. The experimental results reflected that the ultrasonic velocity increased as the ham weight decreased (26.1 m/s per kg), showing a satisfactory correlation between both variables (r=0.95). The ultrasonic velocity was also correlated with the salt and moisture content. However, ham hardness remained fairly constant during post-salting, which confirmed that characteristic textural changes mainly occur during the salting and drying-maturation stages. Thus, the ultrasonic velocity could be a reliable parameter with which to monitor not only overall modifications in ham weight, but also internal changes of moisture and salt content during post-salting in a non-destructive way.

Olive pomace-derived biomasses fractionation through a two-step extraction based on the use of ultrasounds: chemical characteristics.		Foods					Olive-derived biomass is not only a renewable bioenergy resource but also it can be a source of bioproducts, including antioxidants. In this study, the antioxidant composition of extracted olive pomace (EOP) and a new byproduct, the residual fraction from olive pit cleaning (RFOPC or residual pulp) was characterized and compared to olive leafy biomass, which have been extensively studied as a source of antioxidants and other bioactive compounds with pharmacological properties. The chemical characterization showed that these byproducts contain a high amount of extractives; in the case of EOP, it was even higher (52.9%) than in olive leaves (OL) and olive mill leaves (OML) (35.8-45.1%). Then, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) was applied to recover antioxidants from the extractive fraction of these biomasses. The solubilization of antioxidants was much higher for EOP, correlating well with the extractives content and the total extraction yield. Accordingly, this also affected the phenolic richness of the extracts and the differences between all biomasses were diminished. In any case, the phenolic profile and the hydroxytyrosol cluster were different. While OL, OML, and EOP contained mainly hydroxytyrosol derivatives and flavones, RFOPC presented novel trilignols. Other compounds were also characterized, including secoiridoids, hydroxylated fatty acids, triterpenoids, among others, depending on the bioresource. Moreover, after the UAE extraction step, alkaline extraction was applied recovering a liquid and a solid fraction. While the solid fraction could of interest for further valorization as a biofuel, the liquid fraction contained proteins, sugars, and soluble lignin, which conferred antioxidant properties to these extracts, and whose content depended on the biomass and conditions applied. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Conty, V.; Theierl, S.; Floter, E.							Improving the nutritional profile of culinary products: oleogel-based bouillon cubes.		Food & Function					Structured fat phases are the basis of many consumer relevant properties of fat-containing foods. To realise a nutritional improvement-less saturated, more unsaturated fatty acids-edible oleogels could be remedy. The feasibility of traditional fat phases structured by oleogel in culinary products has been evaluated in this study. In this contribution the oleogel application in bouillon cubes as model system for culinary products is discussed. Three different gelators (sunflower wax (SFW), a mixture of beta-Sitosterol and gamma-Oryzanol (SO) and ethylcellulose (EC)), at two concentration levels (5% and 10% (w/w)) each, were evaluated with respect to their physical properties, in the food matrix and application. The application of pure and structured canola oil (CO) was benchmarked against the reference, palm fat (PO). The assessment of the prototypes covered attempts to correlate the physicochemical analyses and sensory data. Organoleptic and analytical studies covered storage stability (up to 6 months) monitoring texture, color and fat oxidation. The results indicate that the substitution of palm fat by oleogel is essentially possible. The characteristics of the bouillon cubes are tuneable by gelator choice and inclusion level. Most importantly, the data show that the anticipated risk of intolerable effects of oxidation during shelf life is limited if antioxidants are used. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Journal of Dairy Science					In this study dairy phospholipid (PL) gels were made using 3 different concentrations of PL (15%, 30%, and 45%) and soybean oil to determine the gel-forming ability and functional traits that dairy PL have. After 24 h of storage the visual stability, crystal morphology, solid fat content, melting behavior, viscosity, and oil binding capacity of the gels were evaluated. All samples showed visual stability, whereas polarized light microscopy showed that high concentrations of PL reduced PL mobility, preventing tubular micelles from forming at high concentrations of PL (45%). Solid fat content increased with an increase in PL concentration. The melting enthalpy increased as the concentration of PL increased. The viscosity was assessed at 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 1/s shear rates. A significant difference was observed between the 45% PL samples and the other samples at low and intermediate shear, but at high shear levels, a significant difference was only seen between the 15% PL sample and the other samples. The oil binding capacity showed a significant difference between the 45% PL sample and the other 2 samples. This study shows that dairy PL can be added to a vegetable oil to produce semi-solid material with appropriate functional properties.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A multilayer microencapsulation process was carried out to protect and deliver chia oil, which presents high nutritional value but also a high susceptibility to lipid oxidation. A high-pressure homogenization was performed with deoiled or hydrolyzed sunflower lecithins (pH 5) to obtain the primary emulsion. The secondary and tertiary layers were deposited, applying the layer-by-layer technique with the addition of chitosan and chia mucilage, respectively. After spray-drying these emulsions, the corresponding microcapsules were obtained and the influence of the types of lecithin (deoiled or hydrolyzed) and microcapsule (mono or multilayered) were studied. The zeta-potential evidenced the electrostatic deposition of the layers through the inversion of the electric charge. Microcapsules presented high microencapsulation efficiency (84-99%) and low moisture content and water activity levels. Most microparticles exhibited whitish and light color, spherical shapes, with continuous and slightly rough walls. The powder dispersibility was compatible with instant foods. All the microcapsules presented low oxidation levels after storage, especially the three-layer systems. This information suggests that multilayer systems can contribute by providing high stability against the oxidative deterioration of functional lipid components present in chia oil.

J		Copelin, J. E.; Firkins, J. L.; Socha, M. T.; Lee, C.							Effects of diet fermentability and supplementation of 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid and isoacids on milk fat depression: 1. Production, milk fatty acid profile, and nutrient digestibility.		Journal of Dairy Science					The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effects of increased diet fermentability and polyunsaturated fatty acids (FA) with or without supplemental 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)-butanoic acid (HMTBa), isoacids (IA; isobutyrate, 2-methylbutyrate, isovalerate, and valerate) or the combination of these on milk fat depression (MFD). Ten Holstein cows (194 58 DIM, 691 69 kg BW, 28 5 kg milk yield) were used in a replicated 5 * 5 Latin square design. Treatments included a high-forage control diet (HF-C), a low-forage control diet (LF-C) causing MFD by increasing starch and decreasing neutral detergent fiber (NDF), the LF-C diet supplemented with HMTBa at 0.11% (28 g/d), the LF-C diet supplemented with IA at 0.24% of dietary dry matter (60 g/d), and the LF-C diet supplemented with HMTBa and IA. Preplanned contrasts were used to compare HF-C versus LF-C and to examine the main effects of HMTBa or IA and their interactions within the LF diets. Dry matter intake was greater for LF-C versus HF-C, but milk yield remained unchanged. The LF-C diet decreased milk fat yield (0.87 vs. 0.98 kg/d) but increased protein yield compared with HF-C. As a result, energy-corrected milk was lower (28.5 vs. 29.6 kg/d) for LF-C versus HF-C. Although the concentration of total de novo synthesized FA in milk fat was not affected, some short- and medium-chain FA were lower for LF-C versus HF-C, but the concentrations of C18 trans-10 isomers were not different. Total-tract NDF apparent digestibility was numerically lower (42.4 vs. 45.6%) for LF-C versus HF-C. As the main effects, the decrease in milk fat yield observed in LF-C was alleviated by supplementation of HMTBa through increasing milk yield without altering milk fat content and by IA through increasing milk fat content without altering milk yield so that HMTBa or IA, as the main effects, increased milk fat yield within the LF diets. However, interactions for milk fat yield and ECM were observed between HMTBa and IA, suggesting no additive effect when used in combination. Minimal changes were found on milk FA profile when HMTBa was provided. However, de novo synthesized FA increased for IA supplementation. We detected no main effect of HMTBa, IA, and interaction between those on total-tract NDF digestibility. In conclusion, the addition of HMTBa and IA to a low-forage and high-starch diet alleviated moderate MFD. Although the mechanism by which MFD was alleviated was different between HMTBa and IA, no additive effects of the combination were observed on milk fat yield and ECM. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Prediction of indicators of cow diet composition and authentication of feeding specifications of Protected Designation of Origin cheese using mid-infrared spectroscopy on milk.		Journal of Dairy Science					The ability of mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIR) to predict indicators (1) of diet composition in dairy herds and (2) for the authentication of the cow feeding restrictions included in the specification of 2 Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheeses (Cantal and Laguiole) was tested on 7,607 bulk milk spectra from 1,355 farms located in the Massif Central area of France. For each milk sample, the corresponding cow diet composition data were obtained through on-farm surveys. The cow diet compositions varied largely (i.e., from full grazing for extensive farming systems to corn silage-based diets, which are typical of more intensive farming systems). Partial least square regression and discriminant analysis were used to predict the proportion of different feedstuffs in the cows' diets and to authenticate the cow feeding restrictions for the PDO cheese specifications, respectively. The groups for the discriminant analysis were created by dividing the data set according to the threshold of a specific feedstuff. They were issued based on the specifications of the restriction of the PDO cheese. The pasture proportion in the cows' diets was predicted by MIR with an coefficient of determination in external validation (R2V) = 0.81 and a standard error of prediction of 11.7% dry matter. Pasture + hay, corn silage, conserved herbage, fermented forage, and total herbage proportion in the cows' diets were predicted with a R2V >0.61 and a standard error of prediction <14.8. The discrimination models for pasture presence, pasture ≥50%, and pasture ≥57% in the cows' diets achieved an accuracy and specificity ≥90%. A sensitivity and precision ≥85% were also observed for the pasture proportion discrimination models, but both of these indexes decreased at increasing thresholds from 0 to 50, and 57% pasture in the cows' diets. An accuracy ≥80% was also observed for pasture + hay ≥72%, herbage ≥50%, pasture + hay ≥25%, absence of fermented herbage, absence of corn silage, and corn silage ≤30% in the cows' diets, but for several models, either the sensitivity or precision was lower than the accuracy. Models built on the simultaneous respect of all the criteria of the feeding restrictions of PDO cheese specifications achieved an accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and precision >90%. Both the regression and discriminant MIR models for bulk milk can provide useful indicators of cow diet composition and PDO cheese specifications to producers and consumers (farmers, dairy plants).

J		Coppin, G.; Audrin, C.; Monseau, C.; Deneulin, P.							Is knowledge emotion? The subjective emotional responses to wines depend on level of self-reported expertise and sensitivity to key information about the wine.		Food Research International					Many factors influence emotional responses evoked by wines. Here we assessed how self-reported wine expertise, tasting condition (blind vs. Informed) as well as sensitivity to key information about wines (e.g., reputation, price, grape variety) impact the subjective affective responses they evoked. We measured subjective affective responses of high and low in self-reported wine expertise consumers to 8 different wines in a blind tasting and in a tasting when information about the wines was known. After their first tasting session, we asked participants the extent to which they considered specific information when they intended to purchase wine (e.g., reputation, etc.). The more wine consumers high in self-reported expertise paid attention to the wine's reputation, the less they used feelings when tasting wines. In contrast, the more the wine tasters low in self-reported expertise paid attention to the wine's reputation, the more feelings they reported. Moreover, when considering positive and negative feelings separately, it appears that the more participants paid attention to the label, the lower the number of positive terms they tended to mention. Additionally, wine tasters low in self-reported expertise were more inclined to report positive feelings towards the wines in the informed condition and if they were sensitive to wine's reputation. In contrast, wine tasters high in self-reported expertise were less inclined to report positive feelings towards the wines in the informed condition and if they were sensitive to wine's reputation. These results hint at the importance of considering psychological theories of emotion while studying wine-elicited emotions, in particular appraisal theories of emotion.

The effect of different application methods of sumac (Rhus coriaria) and tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) on nutritional composition, fatty acids and TBARS values of marinated sea bream (Sparus aurata L., 1758).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, different application methods (Spice, Brew, Infused Oil) were employed using sumac (Rhus coriaria) and tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus) spices and some effects on marinated sea bream were investigated during 180 days of experiment at +4 °C. The nutrition composition of the samples, TBARS values, fatty acid values of the oils, and the fatty acid values of the samples on days 0, 15, and 180 were determined. It can be said that the nutritional composition was minimally affected by different application methods. On the last day of storage, TBARS values of the groups were as follows: BS > C>BT > SIO > ST > SS > TIO. No statistically significant difference was observed in the fatty acids results of olive oil, sumac infused oil, and tarragon infused oil obtained by soaking in olive oil (p>.05). TBARS values of all the groups showed strong positive correlation with SFA, MUFA, and PUFA. PUFAs were the predominant fatty acids, followed by MUFAs and SFAs. Practical applications. It is important to preserve the quality of oils and fatty acids in the preservation of seafood. It is thought that two antioxidants, sumac and tarragon, can be effective on fatty acids. In this study, different application methods have been tried in marinated sea bream and it has been investigated in which method sumac and tarragon spice provide better preservation on nutritional value and fatty acid composition. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Exploring the use of switchable hydrophilicity solvents as extraction phase for the determination of food-packaging contaminants in coconut water samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.		Food Analytical Methods					This work proposes, for the first time, a method based on homogenous liquid-liquid microextraction with switchable hydrophilicity solvent as extraction phase (SHS-HLLME) for the determination of food-packaging contaminants including dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-octyl phthalate (DNOP), 4-octylphenol (4-OP), 4-nonylphenol (4-NP), and benzophenone (BZP) in coconut water samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Experimental parameters that can influence extraction efficiency, such as type and volume of SHS, sample volume, NaOH volume, temperature, and extraction time, were investigated. Using the optimal conditions, the calibration curves were linear from 0.5 to 30 mug L-1 for DMP and DEP; 1 to 30 mug L-1 for DBP, BBF, and DNOF; and 5 to 30 mug L-1 for BZP, 4-OP, and 4-NP. The coefficients of determination ranged from 0.9830 to 0.9972. The relative recoveries varied from 82 to 130%, and the intra-and inter-day precision values were lower than 18% for all analytes for the concentrations of 5,15, and 30 mug L-1. Limit of detection and quantification ranged from 0.15 to 1.51 mug L-1 and from 0.50 to 5.0 mug L-1, respectively. In addition, the robustness of the methodology was examined and exhibited satisfactory results. Finally, the method developed was successfully applied for the analysis of six coconut water samples from food packaging. In this particular case, at least one analyte was found in five samples analyzed in the range of-1. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Antimicrobial activity of MccJ25(G12Y) against gram-negative foodborne pathogens in vitro and in food models.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The use of bacteriocins is a promising alternative to improve food security through the biocontrol of food pathogens and spoilage microorganisms. Gram-negative produced microcin J25 (G12Y), known as (MccJ25 (G12Y)) is a variant of the well-studied and characterized antimicrobial peptide, microcin J25 (MccJ25). In the present work, we explored the activity of this microcin against Gram-negative bacteria linked to foodborne diseases. We evaluated the in vitro antimicrobial activity of MccJ25 (G12Y) in solid medium against a collection of pathogenic and food-altering strains and studied its activity and stability in meat and dairy food systems. We show that MccJ25 (G12Y) exhibited the same in vitro antimicrobial spectrum as its parental microcin (MccJ25) against different Gram-negative foodborne pathogens and spoilage strains. We highlight that low concentrations of MccJ25 (G12Y) between 0.45 and 29.4 muM were able to inhibit a substantial number of pathogens, including Salmonella, Escherichia, Shigella and Enterobacter genus. We also demonstrate the antimicrobial effectiveness of the peptide against Escherichia coli O157:H7 NCTC 12900, Enterobacter cloacae CECT 194 , and Salmonella enterica CECT 4396 in fish and beef burgers and yogurt. MccJ25 (G12Y) was added or not to food matrices inoculated with the foodborne pathogens at 105 CFU/g or mL. Afterward, food products were stored at 4 °C and selective media for the specific enumeration were used to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of each pathogen to MccJ25 (G12Y). The viability of the three pathogens was significantly reduced in the different food biological environments. In yogurt, the peptide decreased E. coli numbers on day 5 by about 4 log 10 CFU/mL as compared to non-treated samples. For S. enterica and E. cloacae no viable cells were detected at the end of the treatment. Adding MccJ25 (G12Y) to fish burgers decreased E. cloacae numbers during storage 2 log10 CFU/g on the first day, reaching a difference of about 5 log 10 CFU/g after 10 days compared to non-treated control. Finally, the peptide decreased E. coli O157:H7 numbers on the beef burgers samples during storage on day 10 by about 3 log 10 CFU/g as compared to non-treated samples. The stability analysis demonstrated that MccJ25 (G12Y) is capable of remaining active in these food matrices for a considerable time during the storage at refrigeration temperatures. These results reinforce the studies on the potential applicability of this microcin as a biopreservative in the food industry.

Depletion study and estimation of the withdrawal period for albendazole in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) parasitised by acanthocephalan (Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae) treated with albendazole-containing feed.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					This study provides the first data related to albendazole (ABZ) and its main metabolites [albendazole sulphoxide (ABZSO), albendazole sulphone (ABZSO2), and albendazole-2-amino sulphone (ABZ-2-NH2-SO2)] residue depletion in tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) parasitised by acanthocephalan (Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae). The ABZ withdrawal period was also calculated. The fish received a daily dose of 10 mg ABZ kg-1 body weight (b. W.) via medicated feed for 34 days. Samples of target tissue (muscle plus skin in natural proportions) were collected 24, 48, 72, 120, 168, 240, and 336 h after the end of ABZ administration. The quantitation of ABZ residues and its metabolites in the target tissue was performed using a validated ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) analytical method. After treatment, ABZ in the target tissue was rapidly metabolised over time, and ABZSO was the most persistent metabolite and was shown to be at the highest levels in the target tissue. Considering the maximum residue limit (MRL) established by Codex Alimentarius in the muscle (100 mug kg-1, species not specified), a withdrawal period of 4 days (112 °C-day) was estimated for the total residue (sum of ABZ and its metabolite residues). Considering data reported in the literature and data obtained in this study, it is suggested that the total residue be considered as marker residue to be adopted for fish in the legislative framework. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Characterization, functional and biological value of protein-enriched defatted meals from sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) and chocho (Lupinus mutabilis).		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					A deficit in protein intake can severely halt children growth, and is associated with both structural and functional pathologies of the brain, as well as increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases. Protein-enriched defatted meals from sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) (sdSI) and chocho (Lupinus mutabilis) (sdCH) were obtained by a solvent defatting procedure. The concentration of protein was higher in sdSI (64%) than in sdCH (60%). Lysine and tryptophan were the limiting amino acid (AA) in each case. However, the AA profile of the protein meals met daily intake FAO requirements for adults, while their blends met the requirements for infants. The sdSI had an in vitro digestibility of 100. Regarding functional properties, sdSI presented higher values for water absorption index (3.5), emulsifying activity (56%), and foaming capacity (167%), while the sdCH had a slightly better oil absorption capacity (2.8). However, when mixing sdSI with sdCH some improvements in functional properties were observed. The nutritional and functional properties of the mixtures of meals can be used to develop protein-enriched foods and beverages. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Cordoba, N.; Moreno, F. L.; Osorio, C.; Velasquez, S.; Ruiz, Y.							Chemical and sensory evaluation of cold brew coffees using different roasting profiles and brewing methods.		Food Research International					This study evaluated the effects of different roasting profiles (time/temperature) and brewing methods on the physicochemical and sensory characteristics of coffee brews. Cold brewing (dripping and immersion) and hot brewing (French press) methods were studied to understand the effects of water temperature and technical brewing method conditions on the chemical compound extraction in coffees roasted at high-temperature short time (HTST) and low-temperature long time (LTLT). The results showed that coffee beverages were clearly differentiated concerning the roasting profile when hot water was used (90 3 °C) in brewing. Separation of beverages according to the water temperature used in brewing was observed. Notably, hot brewing coffees were distinguished from cold brewing (19 2 °C) based on a higher titratable acidity and abundance of some furan compounds. The non-volatile extraction rate increased at higher brewing temperatures. At the same brewing temperature, dripping exhibited a higher extraction rate than immersion brewing, which suggests that the coffee extraction process is affected by the design and operation of the cold brewing system. Coffee beverages brewed with HTST and cold dripping displayed the highest value in total dissolved solids (TDS), extraction yield, as well as the highest caffeine, trigonelline, 4- and 5-caffeoylquinic acids (CQAs) contents. Regardless of the roasting profile, coffees brewed by cold dripping were perceived with more bitter and roasted flavors. In contrast, cold immersion and hot coffee beverages showed remarkable sweetness, nutty, caramel, and malt attributes. In turn, these attributes showed an inverse correlation with caffeine concentration, trigonelline, CQAs, and TDS. The findings of this study demonstrate that volatile and non-volatile compounds present in roasted coffee depend on time-temperature roasting conditions; in turn, their presence in the resulting beverages are related to the extraction of the operational conditions of coffee brewing methods.

Specialty and regular coffee bean quality for cold and hot brewing: evaluation of sensory profile and physicochemical characteristics.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of coffee bean quality (specialty and regular) and brewing method (cold and hot) on the sensory profile and physicochemical characteristics of coffee beverages was studied. Cold brew was prepared by immersion and hot brew coffee by French Press. Total dissolved solids (TDS), titratable acidity (TA), caffeine, trigonelline, 4 and 5-caffeoylquinic acids were quantified by instrumental methods, volatile compounds by GC-MS, and the coffee flavor was through quantitative sensory evaluation. Coffee beverages were more differentiated by brewing method than by the coffee bean quality used in the preparation. Cold brew coffees were mainly associated with volatile 2-methyl-butanal, 5-methyl furfural, and dihydro-2-methyl-3 (2H)-furanone. Hot brew coffee beverages were identified with some specific furans and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. No significant differences were found in TDS, caffeine, trigonelline, 4 and 5 caffeoylquinic acids. A higher TA was observed in hot coffee beverages than in cold brew coffees. Regular bean quality promoted undesirable sensory attributes in both cold and hot brew beverages. However, these attributes were perceived in higher intensity in hot brew coffee beverages. Thus, differences in brewing methods affect the extraction of the chemical compounds present in different coffee bean quality, translating into variations in the sensory profile.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Avocado paste (AP) is a phenolic-rich byproduct of avocado oil extraction. The effects of sub-chronic consumption of diets supplemented with an AP phenolic extract (PE) were analyzed. A standard diet (SD), high-fat diet (HFD), and these supplemented with PE (SD+ PE and HFD+ PE) were used. Significantly increased satiety was observed in PE-supplemented groups, according to less food consumption (-15% in SD+ PE vs. SD, and-11% in HFD+ PE vs. HFD), without changes in weight gain or percentage of adipose tissue. PE-supplemented groups had an increased plasma concentration (+ 16% in SD+ PE vs. SD, and+26% in HFD+ PE vs. HFD) and relative mRNA expression (+74% in SD+ PE vs. SD, and+46% in HFD+ PE vs. HFD) of GLP-1; an increase in plasma leptin and adiponectin was independent of their mRNA expression. Our results suggest that AP-derived PE exerts a satiety effect in vivo, possibly mediated by GLP-1, leptin, and adiponectin. Practical applications. Minimizing food waste is a top priority in most of the world, thus, researchers seek methods to reintroduce industrial fruit and vegetable byproducts into the food processing chain. The present work highlights the potential of avocado byproducts as sources of bioactive phenolic compounds, whose sub-chronic consumption (8 weeks) exerts a satiety action in vivo. Avocado farming is resource-intensive, making it of relevance to producers and processing industries to avoid discarding its byproducts as much as possible. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Foods					Lamb (n = 79) meat colour was scored by 879 untrained consumers using a scale of 0 (brown) to 100 (red). This consumer colour score (CCS) was obtained on m. Longissimus lumborum (loin) and m. Semimembranosus (topside), stored for short (5-7 days), medium (33-35 days), and long periods (110-112 days) and a retail display time of up to 4 days. Consumers perceived topside to be less red initially and changed from red to brown more rapidly when stored for the long-storage period (p< 0.01). Whereas, the initial CCS of loin samples were similar across the storage periods (p> 0.05). CCS and the instrument measure oxy/met (reflectance of light at wavelengths 630 nm and 580 nm) had a low correlation coefficient of 0.33 (p< 0.01). The propensity for lamb growth and leanness indicated by sire breeding values for lamb weight, eye muscle depth, eye muscle fat depth, and loin intramuscular fat had varied and inconsistent effects on CCS. Therefore, even the selection on CCS. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Since the limited current therapeutic alternatives fail in alleviating the symptoms and based on our previous research in in vitro models using the same compounds as the ones used in the present study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of urolithins A (UA) and B (UB) on the growth and survival of endometriotic-like lesions in a murine model of endometriosis. Female BALB/C mice were surgically induced with endometriosis and treated with 2.5 mg kg-1 day-1 intraperitoneal UA or UB. The mice were monitored daily and weighed and the estrous stage was determined. After 28 days of treatment, lesions were counted, measured, excised, and fixed. Both urolithins proved not to affect the estrous cycle or body weight of the mice. UA completely prevented endometriotic-like lesions, while UB diminished the implant volume (p< 0.05). Treatment also reduced epithelial and stromal cell proliferation within the implants (p< 0.001 and p< 0.01, respectively) and apoptosis was enhanced (p< 0.05 and p< 0.01, respectively). These results are promising and reveal that urolithins A and B, separately, have a beneficial effect on the overall endometriotic growth without affecting the body weight or estrous cycle. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	9894	9903	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01702k					FSTA:2022-02-Aj2185

Small-angle neutron scattering reveals basis for composition dependence of gel behaviour in oleic acid - sodium oleate oleogels.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The relationship between gel strength and structure on the micro-and nano-scale has been investigated for oleogels prepared in a range of triglyceride (TAG) oils (sunflower, olive, medium chain triglyceride) using mixtures of oleic acid (OA) and sodium oleate (SO) as gelling agents. Microscopy indicated a reduction in crystal size with increasing SO content. Gel strength increased with SO concentration but, for a constant SO concentration, decreased with the addition of OA. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and ultra-SANS was measured from the gels formed in the TAG oils, as well as in hexadecane oil, the latter employing solvent contrast variation, to study the structures formed in more detail. In both the TAG oils and in hexadecane, SO formed lamellar crystalline structures whose low q scattering was consistent with mass fractal-like behaviour (for 0:1 and 1:8 compositions). Further OA addition (1:4-2:1) resulted in the simultaneous presence of inverse micellar structures. We hypothesise that the negative effect of OA on gel strength is due to the partial dissolution of SO by OA and the loss of gel-mediating SO-based lamellar crystals. The variation in OA: SO ratio is demonstrated to provide control over mechanical properties via large-scale structure formation while the tunability of such gel properties using this mechanism potentially provides an alternative route to the use of solid fats for structuring food.

J. van der							Apparent universality of leguminous proteins in swelling and fibre formation when mixed with gluten.		Food Hydrocolloids					Fibrous meat analogues can be made through shear-induced structuring from gluten in combination with a second protein. A combination of swelling experiments and shear-cell structuring was used to investigate the relation between fibrousness and the presence of a continuous gluten network for mixtures containing gluten and either pea protein, fababean protein or soy protein. When the gluten content of the mixed gels increased, swelling of the other protein decreased proportionately. This suggested the presence of a continuous gluten network. Normalization of the swelling data resulted in an apparent master curve. The strain on the non-gluten protein was derived from the swelling data and increased with increasing gluten content. Structuring the protein mixtures in a High Temperature Shear Cell resulted in fibrous structures at gluten contents ≥0.5 wt/wt. The effect of gluten on swelling and fibre formation is universal for the tested proteins. We, therefore, propose that in gluten-containing mixtures, a continuous gluten network is required for the formation of fibres, while the second protein acts merely as a filler and is replaceable.

J		Corona, O.; Bambina, P.; Filippi, D. D.; Cinquanta, L.							Influence of pre-fermentative addition of aqueous solution tannins extracted from oak wood (Quercus petraea) on the composition of Grillo wines.		European Food Research and Technology					In this research, the chemical characterization of fixed and volatile compounds of two different tannins in aqueous solution (Pratiko L-Harvest and L-Fruit) extracted from oak wood, has been studied. The influence of the above tannins, at different concentrations, on the alcoholic fermentation kinetics and on the composition and sensorial characteristics of a white wine were then evaluated. The wines added tannins in aqueous solution compared to control wines showed significant differences in fixed compounds (colloids, polyphenols and ellagitannins) and volatile compounds (phenolic aldehydes, volatile phenols, furanic and piranic compounds). The differences of aqueous solution tannins extracted from oak wood were partly due to the drying/maturing and roasting methods used in barrel production. Alcoholic fermentation was partially facilitated by the addition of tannins in aqueous solution. The wines obtained showed a higher content of ethyl esters of medium-chain fatty acids (from 22 to 31%) and, in some cases, higher acetate alcohols (from 15 to 28%), relevant to the olfactory sensations provided to the wines. The tannins added to the must before fermentation also made it possible to obtain an additional supply of polyphenols (from 25 to 85%) able to induce more complex sensory profiles in the wines, with increased persistent taste notes. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Chestnut cultivar identification through the data fusion of sensory quality and FT-NIR spectral data.		Foods					The world production of chestnuts has significantly grown in recent decades. Consumer attitudes, increasingly turned towards healthy foods, show a greater interest in chestnuts due to their health benefits. Consequently, it is important to develop reliable methods for the selection of high-quality products, both from a qualitative and sensory point of view. In this study, Castaneaspp. fruits from Italy, namely Sweet chestnut cultivar and the Marrone cultivar, were evaluated by an official panel, and the responses for sensory attributes were used to verify the correlation to the near-infrared spectra. Data fusion strategies have been applied to take advantage of the synergistic effect of the information obtained from NIR and sensory analysis. Large nuts, easy pellicle removal, chestnut aroma, and aromatic intensity render Marrone cv fruits suitable for both the fresh market and candying, i.e., marron glace. Whereas, sweet chestnut samples, due to their characteristics, have the potential to be used for secondary food products, such as jam, mash chestnut, and flour. The research lays the foundations for a superior data fusion approach for chestnut identification in terms of classification sensitivity and specificity, in which sensory and spectral approaches compensate each other's drawbacks, synergistically contributing to an excellent result. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect of in vitro digestion on phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of different apple (Malus domestica) varieties harvested in Mexico.		Food Bioscience					Apple has phenolic compounds that provide it antioxidant capacity, but during the digestion process, these compounds can undergo changes that modify their bioaccessibility and subsequently decrease the beneficial effects on human health. The present study aimed to analyze the effect of in vitro gastrointestinal digestion on bioaccessibility (B) of the total content of phenolic compounds (PC), flavonoids (TF), anthocyanins (TA), and antioxidant capacity (ABTS, DPPH) of five different apple varieties. Samples were subjected to static in vitro digestion model following the InfoGest consensus protocol. After the in vitro digestion, the PC, TF, TA, ABTS, and DPPH content were significantly different (p≤ 0.05) in each digestion stage. The intestinal stage released higher content of PC (20.79-81.43%) and TF (43.08-83.41%), while the gastric stage released higher content of TA (126.49-204.23%) (p≤0.05). The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) indicated that Red Delicious variety was mainly correlated with higher content of PC, TF, and TA before and after in vitro digestion. At the gastric stage, TA presented correlation with ABTS (r: 0.83) and DPPH (r: 0.87), while, in the intestinal stage, PC and TF presented the highest correlation with ABTS (r: 0.97-0.98) and DPPH (r: 0.86-0.92). Though in vitro digestion favors the release of PC, TF, and TA, their content was lower than that obtained before in vitro digestion, which suggests that chemical extraction could overestimate the bioavailability of phenolic compounds.

Cocoa (Theobroma cacao L.) seed-derived peptides reduce blood pressure by interacting with the catalytic site of the angiotensin-converting enzyme.		Foods					This study aimed at determining the effect of cocoa proteins (CP) on the blood pressure, using in silico, in vitro and in vivo approaches. The in silico assay showed 26 Criollo cocoa peptides with alignment in the Blast analysis. Peptide sequences ranged from 6 to 16 amino acids, with molecular weight ranging from 560.31 to 1548.76 Da. The peptide sequences LSPGGAAV, TSVSGAGGPGAGR, and TLGNPAAAGPF showed the highest theoretical affinity with -8.6, -5.0, and -10.2 kcal/mol, for the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), renin, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1-R), respectively. The Criollo CP hydrolysates (CPH) presented in vitro ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.49 mg/mL. Furthermore, the orogastric administration of 150 mg CP/kg/day in rats fed a high-fat (HF) diet (HF+ CP group) showed a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) by 5% (p< 0.001) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) by 7% (p< 0.001) compared with the HF group. The human equivalent dose (HED) of CP for an adult (60 kg) is 1.45 g per day. These results suggest that the consumption of CP could reduce blood pressure by blocking ACE, and could be used as an ingredient in the elaboration of antihypertensive functional foods. © 2021 by the authors.

Development of gluten-free premixes with buckwheat and chia flours: application in a bread product.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The objective of the present work was to develop novel alternative gluten-free premixes for their application in the production of a bread product. Eight formulations of premixes based on light buckwheat flour (LBF) or whole buckwheat flour (WBF) supplemented with chia flour (CF) in a 90:10 ratio (w/w), with and without the addition of xanthan gum (XG 2 g/100 g) were evaluated. A commercial gluten-free premix was used as control. Breads were baked using each formulation and the control premix. The loaves prepared with buckwheat flour and supplemented with CF and XG exhibited a significantly lower mass loss during baking than the control. All the loaves made with LBF presented a higher air fraction, alveolar area and lightness than those prepared with WBF. The joint addition of XG: CF decreased the hardness of the LBF-based loaves. The selected premix (LBF: XG: CF) and the bread exhibited a higher protein, ash, crude fiber and polyunsaturated fatty acid content and antioxidant activity than the commercial premix and its bread (control). The development of premixes based on buckwheat and chia flour represents an alternative with high nutritional value that can be applied to the formulation of gluten-free breads, with adequate technological properties.

Design and characterization of poly (3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyhexanoate) nanoparticles and their grafting in whey protein-based nanocomposites.		Food Hydrocolloids					This work succeeded in the preparation of a nano-biocomposite material based on the use of poly-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyhexanoate nanoparticles (PHBHHx-NPs) within a scaffold of whey protein (WP) based films. The experimental conditions for PHBHHx-NPs preparation by solvent-evaporation technique were set up, and the obtained NPs characterized. Dynamic light scattering analyses showed that PHBHHx-NPs are stable, exhibiting a zeta-potential value close to-40 mV and a Z-average size of 80 nm. Morphological characterization by transmission and scanning electron microscopy confirmed nanoparticle average dimensions. The addition of PHBHHx-NPs to WP-based films improved the mechanical properties of the derived bioplastics, producing more extensible materials preserving their mechanical resistance. The grafting of PHBHHx-NPs as material fillers also enhanced the film barrier properties towards O2, the permeability to both water vapor and CO2 remaining unaffected. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Use of asparaginase for acrylamide mitigation in coffee and its influence on the content of caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid.		Food Chemistry					A factorial design with a duplicate in the central point was used to investigate the effect of treating arabica coffee beans with asparaginase. The investigated factors were enzymatic load (1000 and 5000 ASNU/Kg), water percentage (30 and 90%), and hydrolysis time (1 and 3 h). The acrylamide content was determined by UPLC-MS/MS, and the caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid and caffeine concentrations were determined by HPLC-DAD. The statistical analysis was carried out in the R platform using RStudio graphical interface. The results indicated the importance of coffee bean pretreatment with steam, and that the enzyme load reduced the acrylamide content to 65 mg/kg in coffee beans. The predicted reduction was obtained with hydrolysis time of 2 h, water content of 90%, and asparaginase load of 5000 ASNU/kg. The asparaginase treatment did not influence the major bioactive compounds in coffee. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Combined application of phenolic acids and essential oil components against Salmonella Enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes in vitro and in ready-to-eat cooked ham.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Essential oil components (EOCs) show great potential for substitution of classic synthetic preservatives in the food industry, but their intense flavor at high concentrations hinders the commercial use. When combined with phenolic acids (PAs), however, the amount of EOC needed to inhibit microbial growth can be significantly reduced. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of several combinations of EOCs and PAs on the growth of foodborne pathogens and, thereafter, evaluate the best combination in sliced ham, a highly susceptible product to bacterial contamination in retail shops. Most combinations showed additive effects in vitro against a 4-strain cocktail of Salmonella Enteritidis and a Listeria monocytogenes strain culture. The most effective combination, cinnamaldehyde (CINN) and 2-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA), was evaluated in ready-to-eat (RTE) cooked ham. A package system based in filter papers was designed for continuous delivery of cinnamaldehyde (CINN) and 2-hydroxycinnamic acid (HCA) into the meat matrix. The treatment showed no significative effects in pathogen populations, instrumental color or pH throughout shelf life. Storage time exerted statistical influence in pH, but values remained as expected for ham. L. monocytogenes population varied through storage time, probably due to the psychrotrophic nature of this species. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cadmium uptake by cacao plants can affect plant growth, consumer health and commercialisation. To develop mitigation strategies, it is essential to identify the soil characteristics that could influence this absorption. To determine the relationships between cadmium absorption and the soil characteristics of cacao areas, the responses at concentrations of 0, 2, 5, 10 and 20mugg-1 of cadmium in three soils of these areas and an andisol were evaluated, using 120-day-old seedlings of four cultivars of Theobroma cacao L. Results. In the present study, several relationships were found between chemical and physical soil characteristics and available cadmium, such as real and bulk densities, as well as contents of iron, sand, magnesium, potassium, sodium and copper. Additionally, moderate to strong correlations between potassium (r2 = -0.56) and real density (r2= 0.42), with foliar cadmium, were found. Moreover, a differential deleterious effect on cacao growth in variables such as biomass was corroborated in cadmium concentrations from 5 mugg-1 in soils. There were no statistical differences between cultivars with respect to cadmium uptake or plant growth. Finally, a multiple linear regression model is proposed to estimate the foliar cadmium content (r2= 0.878). Conclusion. Some soil characteristics such as density, as well as sand, clay, aluminium, potassium and iron contents, should be considered before establishing cacao crops to avoid cadmium accumulation. The correlation between potassium with foliar cadmium indicated that potassium could be significant in cadmium uptake mitigation strategies. The high correlation between available cadmium and foliar cadmium indicates that the quantification methodology developed using ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid extractant may be a useful diagnostic tool. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					The convective drying of yacon was investigated (40-70°C). Pulsed vacuum osmotic dehydration (PVOD) (sorbitol 38 °Brix, 35°C, 681mmHg in the first 10 min) as pretreatment was tested. Drying behavior, energy consumption, diffusivity, fructooligosaccharide (FOS) retention, shrinkage, water activity, shrinkage, and color were measured. Fick's model was adequate for drying kinetics adjustment, mainly for untreated samples with shrinkage consideration. PVOD pretreated dried yacon was a less shrunken product in a shorter drying time with up to 60% FOS retention. Nevertheless, the best tested condition for FOS retention (88%) was the convective drying at 60°C without PVOD application. Practical Applications. The yacon is a seasonal plant that presents high concentrations of functional compounds. Like most vegetables, its shelf life is short and storage difficult. Therefore, improved techniques for conservation are required. The present paper evaluates the effects of drying temperature on the production of fresh and osmodehydrated yacon slices during convective drying. This study could offer an interesting response to the changes promoted by these processes, relating to the modifications to the physicochemical properties of osmodehydrated yacon. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects of resistant starch and garlic on the technological quality of wheat bread. Bread formulations with 20% of resistant starch (RS) and 3% of garlic (G) and with both ingredients together (RS+ G) were compared with control wheat bread (C). A decrease in specific volume and crust color on RS bread was obtained while both parameters increased by garlic addition. Resistant starch led to harder crumbs, while garlic led to softer ones. Besides, fresh crumbs with garlic had a more elastic structure (low elastics moduli and high relaxation time) and presented the crunchiest crust. This work shows that the addition of garlic highly improved the baking quality, which had been negatively affected by resistant starch. Thus, combining garlic and resistant starch as ingredients, a functional baked product of good quality and nutritionally improved was obtained. Novelty Impact Statement. Dough with garlic presented a greater expansion associated with larger breads. The presence of garlic and resistant starch affected posetively the baking quality of breads. Breads with garlic and resistant starch presented better technological characteristics and longer shelf life than wheat bread. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Science					Pectobacterium carotovorum is a phytopathogenic bacteria that causes significant economic loses in food crops, such as bell pepper, which is of special significance in the value of production and trade in Mexico. Therefore, a solution for fruit conservation must be sought. Due to environmental concerns, it is necessary the use of environmentally-friendly active packaging. In this article, chitosan and chitosan-thyme essential oil nanocoatings were used for the preservation of green bell pepper. Different formulations based on chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs) and chitosan-thyme essential oil nanoparticles (15,30, and 45%) were prepared. For uncoated and coated bell peppers, the quality and physiological variables of inoculated and uninoculated fruit with P. carotovorum during 12-day storage period were assessed. According to the results, the weight loss of the fruit remained almost constant over the storage days for the different formulations. A decrease in fruit firmness and an increase in the respiration rate and ascorbic acid content until day 8 with a decrease at the end of the storage period were observed. Of all the evaluated nanocoatings, the fruit treated with the formulation containing 15% CSNPs showed the lowest colony-forming units and disease incidence. Also, the coated bell peppers with this formulation had lower CO2 production compared to the remaining treatments, and the weight loss and firmness were maintained. Therefore, the use of CSNP coatings could represent a good alternative for the protection of bell pepper against the pathogenic bacteria P. carotovorum. Practical Application. The results of the application of nanocoatings based on chitosan and chitosan-thyme essential oil as an antibacterial agent against P. carotovorum on green bell pepper during 12-day storage period suggest that nanoparticle-based coatings can be a natural option for the preservation of fruit quality during ripening. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	1	95	102	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15542					FSTA:2021-05-Jq6705

Effect of altitude of flock location, season of milk production and ripening time on the fatty acid profile of Pecorino Sardo cheese.		International Dairy Journal					The influence of different altitudes of flock location, grazing seasons and ripening time on the fatty acid (FA) profile of Pecorino Sardo cheese was investigated. Milk and thirty-six cheeses, representative of 12 zones (4 provinces * 3 altitudes of flock) and 3 seasons of milk production, were analysed by gas-chromatography for FA profile, at 60 and 120 days of ripening. Data were analysed with a linear model, where altitude, season, ripening time, and their interactions were the fixed factors. Milk FA profile was considered at 0 day of ripening. Altitude did not affect the FA profile, but this was influenced by the seasonality of the botanical composition of grazed pasture, with higher concentration of some interesting FA (i.e., vaccenic, rumenic and alpha-linolenic acids) in late winter, and lower concentrations occurred in summer-time, possibly caused by under-nutrition during this period. The FA profile was also influenced by the ripening time. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Analytical Methods					Micro-agglomerate corks, made by agglutination of cork granulate through the addition of different adhesives, represent an important slice of the market of cork stoppers. Binder glues which are polyurethane-or butadiene-based have been used since they have strong agglomerating effect. Unfortunately, polyurethane-based glues can have isocyanide end group compounds which can migrate into the wine. 2,4-toluene diisocyanate (2,4-TDI) and 2,6 toluene diisocyanate (2,6-TDI), can be found in adhesive and could migrate into wine. A simple ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of these active ingredients (a.is.) in wine has been developed. The method has been validated under Eurachem CITAC guidelines (Cooperation on International Traceability in Analytical Chemistry). Instrument limit of detection (LOD) and to a limit of quantification (LOQ) for 2,6 TDI and 2,4 TDI were 0.42 and 0.39 mug/L, and 1.72 and 1.57 mug/L, respectively. Four different solvents applied for recoveries showed quite different rates ranging for 2,6 TDI and 2,4 TDI from 17.96 to 88.53%, and 40.08 to 99.18%, respectively. Real sample analysis showed low residue levels, especially of 2,6 TDI, with values always below the LOQ. The data reported on real samples allowed to establish that from a risk management purpose, no toxicology risk can be accomplished. ©The Author(s) 2020.

J		Corrias, F.; Taddeo, R.; Arru, N.; Angioni, A.							Effect of the technological process from vine to wine on pesticide residues in Vernaccia di Oristano cultivar.		Foods					Vernaccia is a white grape mostly used to produce a distinct wine protected by the controlled designation of origin (DOC) recognition. It is very susceptible to fungal disease, and it is subjected to a defined management protocol in the field. Winemaking could influence pesticide residues through different mechanisms. This work investigated the influence on pesticide residues of the winemaking process at the industrial level of the wine Vernaccia di Oristano. Thirty-five samples of grapes, two musts, and two vines (both liquid fraction and pellets) were analyzed by using a validated multiresidue LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry) method. Data obtained showed the presence in grapes juice of 16 pesticides (8 not allowed in the EU) with mandipropamid and mepanipyrim, the only ones with values higher than their MRL (maximum residue level). Pesticide residues decrease in must was related to the dilution effect due to mixing the grape samples. However, pellets analysis also confirmed the high affinity of pesticides for the suspended material (fenhexamid), whereas the increase in wine to a re-solubilization process from the lees during the fermentation step. The present paper highlighted the effectiveness of the technological process of winemaking to decrease pesticide residues compared to the raw material. © 2021 by the authors.

Fipronil and fipronil sulfone distribution in chicken feathers and eggs after oral and dermal exposure.		Foods					This work aimed to investigate the bio-distribution and the persistence of fipronil and its primary metabolite fipronil sulfone after oral and dermal administration by simulating natural farming conditions. Fipronil and fipronil sulfone detection and quantification were performed in different poultry matrices using an LC-MS/MS method coupled with modified QuEChERS extraction. After oral administration, fipronil was detected in feathers at each sampling time, in eggs for 28 days, and in the internal organs at the end of the experiment. After dermal administration, high levels of fipronil were detected in feathers, accounting for 195.85 8.54 mg/kg, which were reduced by a third after 60 days. No traces of fipronil were detected in the eggs or internal organs. In addition, fipronil sulfone showed remarkable residues in all samples in trial 2. The data obtained confirmed that inappropriate use of unauthorized pesticides can lead to severe contamination of entire poultry farms. The contemporary presence of fipronil sulfone in feathers and eggs associated with the lack of fipronil in eggs suggests recent dermal contamination or past oral contamination. Moreover, simultaneous analysis of hens' feathers and eggs could represent a new method to improve large-scale monitoring programs and animal welfare, limiting their slaughter. © 2021 by the authors.

Drying of persimmon fruit (Diospyros kaki L.) pretreated by different osmotic processes.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Persimmon is a short shelf life fruit with interesting potential for application in different industrial segments. The immersion of food in a hypertonic (30 and 45 °Brix) or even hypotonic medium can be used as a pretreatment for the drying process. In this study, the convective drying of persimmons was preceded by osmotic dehydration (OD) with fructose in a standard atmosphere, pulsed vacuum osmotic dehydration (PVOD), ultrasound (US)-assisted OD, and US pretreatment in distilled water. Pretreatment times were 0, 10, and 30min. The samples were subjected to convective drying at 40 and 60 °C, 0.5 ms-1. The effects of the pretreatments on the drying kinetics, volumetric shrinkage, and rehydration capacity were investigated. Fick's model and the Dincer and Dost model were used to fit the drying evolution. In addition to the influence of the osmotic solution concentration, moisture content and solid gain were functions of the treatment type. Convective drying required 260-740 min. The use of PVOD and US pretreatments resulted in the shortest drying times. The dried fruits showed particular characteristics with each different pretreatment. Both tested models presented satisfactory adjustments, but Fick's model was the best approach. In general, the treatments caused structural modifications in the persimmon fruits that modified the drying kinetics and the properties of the dried food. Practical Applications. Convective drying is a food processing method used to extend the shelf life of fruits, such as persimmons. The use of pretreatments is an interesting strategy to improve the drying process. However, the combination of these technologies can influence drying kinetics. Therefore, the use of mathematical models is important to represent the behavior of these processes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Handling wine pomace: the importance of drying to preserve phenolic profile and antioxidant capacity for product valorization.		Journal of Food Science					Four different wine grape pomaces (GP) (Vitis vinifera) varieties, Auxerrois, Pinot Blanc, Gamay and Pinot Noir, and obtained from white, rose or red wine vinification, were considered for possible valorization in food supplement industry. Stabilization of GP by drying is paramount prior to further processing in the valorization chain, as GP might suffer spoilage over time. The objectives of this work were therefore to: evaluate the effect of microbiological spoilage and drying on the polyphenol profile and antioxidant capacity of GP; define a drying procedure by comparing kinetics of freeze-drying (FD) and vacuum oven (VO) (at 60 °C and 40 °C). Microbiological spoilage led to significant losses (P< 0.01) of antioxidant capacity (40% to 87%) and total phenolic content (70% to 90%), while drying had no significant effect. FD and VO at 60 °C drying kinetics exhibited similar drying curves, and a dry weight (DW) plateau was reached by 48 hr. In contrast VO at 40 °C required 170 hr to reach similar DW values, pointing out the importance of temperature when opting for VO technology. Antioxidant capacity of GP extracts did not differ between drying methods. Interestingly, GPs from white and rose wines (AUX, PB, and GAM) had up to 3.5 times higher content (P< 0.001) of total polyphenols compared to PN, obtained from red wine. These results reinforce the importance of drying of GP as a pretreatment, which otherwise could result in significant product degradation. Additionally, we propose white and rose GP as more interesting sources for valorization, with higher phenolic content, compared to red wine GP. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Acrylamide is a food contaminant that is formed during processes such as frying, baking and roasting. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), acrylamide is a possible carcinogenic compound in humans. In this work, 257 food samples were analyzed in Colombia to determine the acrylamide content. Samples of potato chips, french fries, bread, cookies, coffee, panela, fried banana and traditional fritters (such as egg or cheese pies) were prepared and analyzed following the Total Diet Study methodology. The highest acrylamide content was found in potato chips with 635mug/kg and panela with 521mug/kg. The calculation of margin of exposure was made by combining the analytical results of composition with consumption data. The highest average exposure in the group of adults was 0.30mug/kg body weight (b.w.) per day in adults from 19 to 30 years old; for children, the highest exposure was 0.92mug/kg b.w. Per day in children from 2 to 3 years old. These exposure values indicate that acrylamide is a public health concern for the Bogota population.

Antivirulence activity of a dietary phytochemical: hibiscus acid isolated from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. reduces the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in a mouse infection model.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Hibiscus sabdariffa L. (Hs) calyxes, rich in organic acids, are included in diets in different countries. In recent years, some phytochemicals have been shown to reduce bacterial virulence at sublethal concentrations by interfering with quorum sensing (QS) systems. Therefore, in this study the antivirulence properties of Hs calyxes and two gamma-lactones (hibiscus acid [HA] and its methyl ester) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa were analyzed. Acetone and methanol extracts of Hs showed anti-QS activity by inhibiting violacein production (60% to 80% with 250 mug/mL). In molecular docking analysis, the gamma-lactones registered a good binding score, which suggests strong interaction with the active site of LasR protein. To verify their effect in vitro, they were isolated from Hs and evaluated in six QS-regulated phenotypes, as well as in ExoU toxin that is released by the type III secretion system (T3SS). At 500 mug/mL they reduced alkaline protease (29-52%) and elastase (15-37%) activity, biofilm formation (~75%), and swarming (50%), but there was no effect on pyocyanin production, hemolytic activity, or type III secretion. In a mouse abscess/necrosis model, HA at sublethal concentrations (15 and 31.2 mug/mL) affected infection establishment and prevented damage and systemic spread. In conclusion, HA is the first molecule identified with antivirulence properties in Hs with the potential to prevent infections caused by P. aeruginosa.			munoz, naybi/0000-0002-6243-7983; RODRIGUEZ-ZAVALA, JOSE SALUD/0000-0002-7094-5523; GONZALEZ-PEDRAJO, BERTHA/0000-0002-2125-2157							2021	24	9	934	943	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.0135					FSTA:2022-03-Tb0960

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Effect of vacuum impregnation (VI) times on quality and healthy potential attributes of fresh-cut apples was modeled, determining optimal processing times. Mild VI treatments (67.7 mbar vacuum pressure, 30°Brix sucrose osmotic solution containing citric and ascorbic acids) were applied with vacuum (tv) and relaxation (tr) times of 1.14 to 14 min through a central composite design. After VI, respiration rate decreased as tv increased but increased with tr. Bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity increased with both processing times. Optimal tv and tr obtained for minimizing respiration rate and maximizing the attributes related to sensory quality were 6.18 and 1.14 min. Otherwise, optimal tv and tr for minimizing the respiration rate, maximizing the related sensory properties, and the health potential of fresh-cut apples were longer (10.18 and 6.21 min). Mild VI, with an antioxidant solution at appropriate VI times, is an adequate technology for obtaining fresh-cut apples with improved fresh-like quality and healthy characteristics. Novelty impact statement: This study showed that mild vacuum impregnation treatment with an antioxidant solution is an adequate technology for processing fresh-cut apples with improved healthy potential. The optimal vacuum and relaxation times improve the fresh-cut apple qualities and its health potential after 7 days of storage at 1.5 °C if both are suitably selected. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Microencapsulation of pomegranate seed oil using a succinylated taro starch: characterization and bioaccessibility study.		Food Bioscience					Pomegranate and taro are domesticated and underutilized crops in Mexico. Particularly, pomegranate seed oil (PSO), which exhibits health benefits, is scarcely exploited in the food industry due to oxidative degradation. This work evaluates the microencapsulation of pomegranate seed oil by spray drying using succinylated taro starch (STS) and beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), as an alternative strategy to protect and deliver PSO. A Central Composite Design (CCD) was applied and the treatment with the highest PSO encapsulation efficiency (61.09 0.41%) was selected. PSO-loaded microparticles obtained with 15% feed solids using 190 °C inlet air temperature, showed low aw (0.08 0.01), moisture (1.26 0.05%), hygroscopicity (11.69 0.57%), and water solubility (9.81 0.24%). The microencapsulation improved PSO oxidative stability. The in vitro bioaccessibility study and the kinetic analysis, on the other hand, evidenced that microparticles of succinylated taro starch obtained by spray drying are suitable as carriers for active compounds to be released at the small intestine following a swelling-controlled release mechanism.

Effect of the consumption of amaranth seeds and their sprouts on alterations of lipids and glucose metabolism in mice.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus) is appreciated for its nutritional and functional quality. This study evaluated the effects of consuming amaranth seeds and their sprouts on the metabolic markers in ICR male mice. Ungerminated amaranth seeds (A) and one-day (G1) and three-day (G3) germinated amaranth sprouts were dried and milled. The mice groups (n=10) were fed standard (N) or hypercaloric (H) diets and 1 g A, G1 or G3/kg body weight for 28 days. The total cholesterol (TC), high-and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL), atherogenic index (AI), triglyceride (TG) and glucose levels were determined in blood samples. Germination increased the dietary fibre, phenolic and flavonoid concentration and decreased ash and squalene concentration. A, G1 or G3 consumption also decreased body weight, TC, LDL, AI and glucose levels in H group mice. Thus, amaranth seed or sprout consumption could be beneficial for people with altered lipid metabolism. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3269	3277	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15014					FSTA:2021-10-Mg6405

J		Coskun, A. E. I.; Ocak, O. O.							Foaming properties of different forms of caseins in aqueous systems.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Foaming properties of sodium caseinate (NaCas) particle dispersions, native NaCas solutions, and casein micelle dispersions were investigated by visual observations and by considering viscosity and structural differences. The effect of NaCl on the foaming properties of systems was also discussed. The presence of NaCl (50 mM, 100 mM, and 200 mM) changed the foam stability of NaCas particle dispersions and native NaCas solutions, whereas foam stability of casein micelle dispersions was not affected by the presence of salt. When there was no NaCl addition to the systems, NaCas particle dispersions showed the highest foam stability (~3 h), whereas when there was NaCl in the medium, native NaCas solutions showed the highest foam stability (~2 h). The presence of salt ions changed the repulsive forces between proteins, which could result in a partial disintegration of particles and aggregation of native proteins. The presence of both particles and their dissociated aggregates in NaCas particle dispersions was found to increase the foaming properties. The behavior of NaCas particles at the interface was similar to the colloidal particles, which was different from the behavior of native proteins. Therefore, the NaCas particles have the potential to be used as a food-grade Pickering stabilizer in aerated food products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	3	2275	2284	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00824-x					FSTA:2021-11-Pe6017

Effect of cooling rate on Clostridium perfringens survival trends in selected home-made cooked, reheated, and recooled meals with different consumer scenarios.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Food poisoning may occur due to enterotoxins produced by Clostridium perfringens in meal if the number of C. perfringens increases more than 1 log10 cfu/g after cooking. Therefore, cooling step is important to control C. perfringens growth. The aim of this study was investigating the effect of cooling rate in home-made cooked and reheated/recooled meals on the growth of C. perfringens. Two different household type refrigerators and room temperature were adjusted as cooling environments. Cooling condition 1 (CC1, 15.5°C/hr), cooling condition 2 (CC2, 7.7°C/hr) and room temperature (RT, 6.2°C/hr) cooling rates were used. Three different meals which provide suitable medium for C. perfringens growth were prepared. The number of C. perfringens in meals that were cooled from 60 to 15°C at RT was higher than meals which were cooled at CC1 and CC2. There was no considerable difference on C. perfringens growth between the meals cooled at CC1 and CC2. Novelty impact statement. Clostridium perfringens causes foodborne diseases by improper cooling of hot foods and toxin production occurs with the increase in the number of C. perfringens. C. perfringens vegetative cell counts in 3 different meals were analyzed. It was observed that cooling meals from 60 to 15°C in room temperature increased the number of C. perfringens in meals, and C. perfringens proliferation can easily be seen during cooling rates slower than 7.7°C/hr. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15906					FSTA:2022-03-Cd0658

Effect of far infrared heating process on surface decontamination and quality attributes of whole yellow and white onions.		Food Control					This study aimed to develop an effective decontamination process for whole yellow and white onions with maintained quality attributes. For this purpose, a far infrared radiation (FIR) process was evaluated to determine its effects on microbial safety and quality of the onions. Prior to the FIR process, samples were inoculated with Salmonella culture to about 7-8 log10 CFU/cm2 and stored for 1-48 h at room temperature. Inoculated samples were then processed up to 120 s at 400 °C infrared source temperature. Temperature chance of the onions was recorded by using T-type thermocouples, and surface temperature distribution was obtained with an infrared thermal camera. Quality attributes (color changes, mass losses and textural changes) were also evaluated following the FIR process. The results indicated that 3.3 and 2.4 log10 CFU/cm2 reductions in the Salmonella counts were obtained for the whole yellow and white onions, stored for 1 h at room temperature after 120 s FIR processing. The background microbial population on the outer skin of the onions was under the detection limit (<1 log10 CFU/g). It was observed that the effectiveness of FIR treatment on Salmonella decontamination decreased as the storage time increased from 1 to 48 h at room temperature. FIR process did not significantly affect the quality attributes of the onions, and the results confirmed the potential use of FIR process for surface decontamination of the onions. Further studies were suggested to design an effective FIR system for industrial scale applications. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

To optimise OTA removal from white and red wines at high levels (10.0 mug/L) using activated carbons (ACs) different commercial deodorising ACs were tested. OTA elimination from white wines was less dependent on ACs characteristics, with 100% removal with all but one AC with the lowest total pore volume. For red wines, only one of the ACs with higher abundance of mesopores was successful in completely removing OTA. This decrease in performance was due to the competition of anthocyanins for ACs mesopores. ACs treatment impacted positively on white wine chromatic characteristics, decreasing the yellowness-brownish colour but for the red wine it was observed a higher but limited impact (maximum 24% decrease) on wine colour. ACs pore volume distribution, with pore sizes in the range 42.6-55.9 angstrom and 125.6-137.4 angstrom were important for efficient OTA removal. These results will allow the rational design of ACs with pore volume characteristics for OTA elimination with less impact on wine colour. Therefore, it was shown for the first time that AC with appropriate pore size distribution can remove completely OTA from white and also red wines. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cosson, A.; Blumenthal, D.; Descamps, N.; Souchon, I.; Saint-Eve, A.							Using a mixture design and fraction-based formulation to better understand perceptions of plant-protein-based solutions.		Food Research International					The food industry is focused on developing plant-based foods that incorporate pea protein isolates. However, these ingredients are often described as having persistent beany, bitter, and astringent notes, which can decrease the desirability of the resulting foods. These perceptions are rooted in the complex composition of volatile and non-volatile compounds in foods. The aim of our study was to better understand how the volatile and non-volatile fractions of pea protein isolates influence the perception of pea-protein-based foods. To this end, a mixture design was used. First, we obtained three fractions (the pellet, permeate, and retentate) from two pea protein isolates, resulting in a total of six fractions. Second, we used various combinations of the six fractions to create a set of 46 pea-protein-based solutions via various processes (solubilization, centrifugation, filtration, and mixing). Each fraction was specifically representative of the following constituent groups: insoluble proteins (the pellet); soluble compounds, such as volatiles, peptides, and phenolics (the permeate); and soluble proteins interacting with volatiles (the retentate). Factor levels were chosen with two aims: to explore the widest possible range of combinations and to realistically represent protein concentrations so as to build optimal mixture models. Third, 17 trained panelists were asked to score the attributes of the solutions using sensory profiling. Model performance was assessed using analysis of variance; results were significant for 18/18 attributes, and there was no significant lack-of-fit for 17/18 attributes. It was also assessed using the results of trials conducted with six supplementary solutions. These results clarified the origin of the perceived beany, bitter, and astringent notes. Beaniness was mainly influenced by the retentate and permeate fractions and was strongly affected by hexanal levels. Bitterness was mainly influenced by the retentate fraction, whereas astringency was influenced by the retentate and pellet fractions. Additionally, perception of these latter two attributes was affected by caffeic acid levels. This study has increased understanding of the relationship between pea protein fractions and the undesirable sensory attributes of pea protein isolates. It has also revealed how fraction-based formulation could be used to reduce the beaniness, bitterness, and astringency of pea-protein-based foods. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Costa, A.; Niero, G.; Franzoi, M.; Cassandro, M.; Marchi, M. de; Penasa, M.							Iodine content in bovine milk is lowly heritable and shows limited genetic variation.		Journal of Dairy Science					Milk and dairy products are considered important sources of iodine in several countries. Despite this, there is a paucity of studies that have investigated sources of variation of milk iodine, especially on a large scale. So far, it is not clear if milk iodine content could be increased through breeding in dairy cattle. Recently, a mid-infrared spectroscopy prediction model has been developed for an indirect quantification of iodine content in cow milk, as it is a faster and less expensive method that allows the prediction at population level. The model has coefficient of determination and ratio of performance to deviation in external validation of 0.57 and 1.44, respectively, and it was used in the present study to predict the iodine content from historical milk spectral data to investigate phenotypic and genetic aspects in the Italian Holstein cattle. Based on the accuracy of the model, the prediction was interpreted as proxy for the real milk iodine concentration (IODP). The data set comprised 33,776 test-day records with IODP from 4,072 cows. Data of IODP were transformed through natural logarithm to achieve a normal distribution. The effect of parity, lactation stage, and month of sampling were investigated, and genetic parameters were estimated using a test-day repeatability animal model. Milk IODP decreased with parities and was the lowest in early lactation. Heritability of IODP was low (0.025) and it was positively genetically correlated with milk yield and negatively with fat content. Results suggested that it would be challenging to directly improve this trait through breeding strategies in dairy cattle, because IODP is mainly affected by temporary environmental factors and thus, cannot be easily improved through genetics. Although preliminary, findings of this study suggest that it would be more convenient to develop feeding and management strategies to drive milk iodine level than to put efforts and resources into breeding strategies. Further studies should validate IODP as an indicator trait of milk iodine content by improving reference data and estimating genetic correlation between predicted and measured values.

Consumption of clarified goat butter added with turmeric (Curcuma longa L.) increase oleic fatty acid and lipid peroxidation in the liver of adolescent rats.		Food Bioscience					The present study investigated the consumption of clarified goat butter (with or without turmeric) on physical, hepatic, biochemical parameters and lipid peroxidation in the livers of male adolescent Wistar rats aged 35 days. Four groups were formed: control (CONT)-treated with distilled water; Turmeric (CM): treated with 60 mg/kg of turmeric; Clarified goat butter (BT): treated with 2000 mg/kg of goat butter and Goat butter mixed with turmeric (BTCM): received 2000 mg/kg of goat butter added with turmeric. Data showed a reduction in the liver fat in CM and BT in relation to the CONT and BTCM. Aspartate aminotransferase was decreased in the CM, BT and BTCM compared to CONT. CM presented reduced glucose, total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides (TC) and increased HDL. The BT presented decreased in TC and LDL. BTCM showed reduction in TC, LDL, and HDL. Lipid peroxidation increased in all experimental groups. There was a reduction in the saturated fatty acids in CM liver; BT and BTCM showed higher deposition of mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids in the liver. In conclusion, the consumption of clarified goat butter improved plama lipids but reduced HDL, did not elevated fat liver or liver enzimes but lipid peroxidation was increased. Thus, combined supplementation with clarified goat butter complemented with turmeric did not result in additional benefits when the treatment occurred during adolescence.

J		Costa, B. E. dos S.; Coelho, N. M. M.							Selective determination of As(III) and total inorganic arsenic in rice sample using in-situ mu-sorbent formation solid phase extraction and FI-HG AAS.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A noteworthy solid phase extraction procedure was developed for speciation of inorganic arsenic in rice samples using flow injection-hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (FI-HG AAS). The procedure is based on the in-situ formation of quaternary ammonium salt as mu-sorbent. A small amount of tetra-n-butylammonium bromide (TBAB) was used as phase-transfer agent and injected into the sample solution. After shaking, a small volume of perchlorate was added as ion-pairing agent. Due the interaction between these agents, fine particle solids are formed. As (III) was selectively extracted after complexation with ammonium pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate (APDC). The suspension was centrifuged and the sedimented phase can be leached with HCl and introduced into the FI-HG AAS to recover the adsorbed analyte. The advantages of this procedure include short extraction time, good dispersion, good recovery and low residue formation. The variables were optimized by fractional factorial design and response surface methodology. The LOD and LOQ were, respectively, 0.01 and 0.04 mug g-1. The procedure shows potential for determination of low concentrations of As (III), with pre-concentration factor 17 and RSD of 5.5%. The method was applied on IRMM-804 Rice Flour and no significant difference (p>0.05) was observed, it can be successfully applied to the monitoring of arsenic in real samples.

Food Control					Seafood is the main source of dietary mercury (Hg) exposure and it can be affected by species, origin, tissue, and processing. The objective of this study was to investigate total Hg in shrimp and mussels from the retail market, compare species, body tissue distribution and cooking time, and to estimate dietary exposure. A total of 126 samples (whiteleg and Atlantic seabob shrimp and South American mussel) were analyzed. Total mercury was quantified by combustion atomic absorption spectrometry with gold amalgamation. Every sample had total Hg lower than maximum legislation levels. Higher mean levels were found in mussels compared to shrimp; and whiteleg shrimp had higher mean Hg levels compared to Atlantic seabob (p < 0.05). Mercury levels in the muscle were higher than in the exoskeleton. Boiling for up to 4 and 6 min did not affect Hg levels in shrimp and mussels, respectively. The estimated methylmercury (MeHg) mean intake from the consumption of shrimp and mussels (0.04-0.09 mug/kg bw for 3 portions/week consumption) was low, less than 6% of the provisional tolerable weekly intake-PTWI.

Catuai) using a hexagonal microwave dryer designed by numerical simulations.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The consumption of specialty coffees has been increasing significantly in recent years. Their quality is influenced by several factors and the drying method is the most important. In order to reduce drying time and maintain the quality of the coffee, several techniques have been used, among which the microwave-assisted convective drying stands out. In this work, a hexagonal microwave dryer was developed using numerical simulation techniques; then some parameters were evaluated in drying of special coffee using air at room temperature and microwaves heating, named hybrid drying. The results showed that the simulations reaches good results, being possible its use in the prediction of the electromagnetic fields and dimensioning of hexagonal cavities. In addition, the prototype performed well in the coffee drying, influenced by the coffee mass, temperature and time, reducing the moisture content from 50.4 to 10 g/100g wet basis in 5 hr. The hybrid drying was advantageous compared with convective or microwave drying processes. Practical applications. Special coffees require long drying times so that there is no loss of product quality. The application of hybrid drying by including microwave heating in the drying equipment reduces the energy cost and the processing time, providing an improvement in the processing of specialty coffees. Through this work, it was possible to verify the scale-up potential of the microwave cavities by simulation and the hybrid drying of special coffees. The use of numerical simulation techniques for the design and scale-up of microwave cavities will help researchers and the industry to dimension cavities for use in several scientific areas, further spreading hybrid drying via microwave. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	5			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13666					FSTA:2021-08-Hn8188

Effect of microwave-assisted processing on polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase inactivation kinetics of acai-berry (Euterpe oleracea) pulp.		Food Chemistry					Microwave heating has been considered a promising technology for continuous flow thermal processing of fluid foods due to better retention of quality. Considering the importance of acai-berry pulp and its perishability, the inactivation kinetics of peroxidase (POD) and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were investigated under conventional and microwave heating. First-order two-component model was well fitted to the data, indicating the presence of at least two fractions with different resistances. POD was more thermally resistant (90% inactivation for 40 s at 89 °C) and could be considered as a processing target. Inactivation curves dependency on heating technology suggests specific effects of microwaves on the protein structure. Additionally, the dielectric properties of acai-berry pulp were evaluated at 915 and 2,450 MHz for temperatures up to 120 °C. Power penetration depth dropped with temperature at 915 MHz (from 29 to 11 mm), but was less affected at 2,450 MHz (between 8 and 11 mm).

Foods					Aglaomorpha quercifolia (L.) Hovenkamp & S. Linds is an extensively used species in traditional medicinal systems in several areas of the world due to some important medicinal properties such as antioxidant, antibacterial, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities. In East Timor, different parts of this fern are used either as remedies or as food. The ingestion of a broth made from its rhizome improves lactation, and young fronds of this fern are boiled and eaten with rice by the locals. Nevertheless, its chemical profile is far from being established. The present work aims to establish the chemical profile of both rhizomes and leaves n-hexane extracts by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). The results showed the leaves richness in fatty acids with interesting nutritional values (omega-6/omega-3=0.68, AI=0.59, TI=0.30), being linolenic acid (253.710.93 mg/g dry leaves) and palmitic acid (237.270.59 mg/g dry leaves) the significant compounds in the extract. Whereas the rhizome extract is mostly rich in terpenoids, such as steroid, cycloartane, and hopanoid derivatives, being hop-16-ene (166.450.53 mg/g dry rhizome) and beta-sitosterol (50.760.11 mg/g dry rhizome) the major compounds. Several compounds are reported for the first time in the species, and the data herein reported contributes to confirming the species nutritional value. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Bioscience					Structured guava (SG) was produced by inducing gelation of guava pulp adding agar and gellan gum (GG). The rheological properties, as well as in vitro bioaccessibility of ascorbic acid (AA), total antioxidant activity (TAA) and total extractable polyphenols (TEP) were investigated. The results illustrated that the SG gel network made from agar and low acyl gellan (LAG) was completely developed at temperatures close to 20 °C. LA75/HA25 showed higher elastic behavior in time sweep. The AA analysis of the pulp and SG revealed that these compounds remained practically unchanged after gastrointestinal digestion in vitro (GID), with a higher bioaccessibility percentage. The average values of TAA and TEP of the structured products were close to those of the guava pulp, with no interference from the use of agar and GG. The Optimized Descriptive Profile showed that the hydrocolloid used influenced the sensory attributes of the SG, changing the texture and appearance.

Storage of a Touriga Nacional red wine in contact with Juglans regia L. and Quercus petraea L. wood chip species: comparative influence on phenolic and sensory characteristics.		European Food Research and Technology					Several previous research works have demonstrated the value of different wood species in oenology. However, the use of walnut wood from Juglans regia L. Species was not totally previously considered, for wine aging. Thus, this work focuses on the comparative evolution over a period of 30 storage days of phenolic composition and sensory characteristics of a Touriga Nacional red wine stored in contact with toasted chips from walnut (Juglans regia L.) and oak (Quercus petraea L.) wood chip species. In addition, in this study a previous global phenolic analysis was also carried out for both wood chip species by the use of model wine solutions. The results obtained in our research demonstrated an absence of a clear differentiation between the two wood chip species studied. However, taking into account the impact of these two wood chip species on wine phenolic composition, the results also showed that the wine stored in contact with Quercus petraea L. Chips exhibited in general the highest values for the majority of the global phenolic parameters analyzed. Wine stored in contact with Juglans regia L. chips showed significantly higher values for oligomeric fraction of proanthocyanidins. However, from a sensory point of view, a tendency for lower scores for the majority of sensory descriptors considered in this study was obtained for this wine compared to the same wine but stored in contact with Quercus petraea L. chips, as well as the control wine. The outcomes of this work improved the knowledge of the impact of a no conventional wood species (Juglans regia L.) in oenology. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.		; Ricardo-da-Silva, Jorge M./A-7345-2008	Jordao, Antonio/0000-0003-1129-4633; Correia, Ana Cristina/0000-0002-6283-1964; Ricardo-da-Silva, Jorge M./0000-0003-3706-0982							2021	247	12	3037	3052	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03854-3					FSTA:2022-03-Hj1650

Effects of the reactive moiety of phenolipids on their antioxidant efficiency in model emulsified systems.		Foods					Our previous research was focused on the effects of hydrophobicity on the antioxidant (AO) efficiency of series of homologous antioxidants with the same reactive moieties. In this work we evaluate the antioxidant efficiency of hydrophobic phenolipids in 4:6 olive oil-in-water emulsions, with different phenolic moieties (derived from caffeic, 4-hydroxycinnamic, dihydrocaffeic acids, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol), with alkyl chains of 8 and 16 carbons, and compare the antioxidant efficiency with that of the parent compounds. All catecholic phenolipids, in particular the C8 derivatives, have proven to be better antioxidants for the oxidative protection of emulsions than their parental compounds with octyl dihydrocaffeate being the most efficient (16-fold increase in relation to the control). To understand the importance of some factors on the antioxidant efficiency of compounds in emulsions, Pearson's correlation analysis was carried out between antioxidant activity and the first anodic potential (Epa), reducing capacity (FRAP value), DPPH radical scavenging activity (EC50) and the concentration of antioxidants in each region of the emulsified system. Results. Confirm the importance of the effective concentration of AOs in the interfacial region (AOI) (rho=0.820) and of the Epa (rho =-0.677) in predicting their antioxidant efficiency in olive oil-in-water emulsions. © 2021 by the authors.

A fast, low-cost, sensitive, selective, and non-laborious method based on functionalized magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic solid-phase extraction, and fluorescent carbon dots for the fluorimetric determination of copper in wines without prior sample treatment.		Food Chemistry					A new fluorimetric method for copper (II) determination in wines was developed combining functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (FMNP) and fluorescent carbon dots (FCD). To produce FMNP, Fe3O4 was coated with Al2O3 forming Fe3O4@Al2O3 core-shell magnetic nanoparticles and functionalized with PAN and SDS. FCD was synthesized from pineapple juice through hydrothermal carbonization. For copper determination, aliquots of wine, the FMNP dispersion, and Britton-Robinson buffer (pH = 4.0) were mixed under stirring to allow the adsorption of copper by FMNP. Cu-FMNP complex was attracted by a niobium magnet and, after discarding the non-magnetic material, the copper (II) ions were eluted with an FCD dispersion before fluorescence quenching measurements. The proposed method presented a linear range from 0.020 to 0.100 mg L-1 (r2 = 0.9953), RSD (intraday) < 3.0%, and recovery rates from 96 to 105%. FMNP and FCD properties permitted extraction/preconcentration/determination of copper within 1 min with an enrichment factor of nine and without prior sample treatment.

Characterization of PHBV films loaded with FO1 bacteriophage using polyvinyl alcohol-based nanofibers and coatings: a comparative study.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					There is a current demand for novel active food packaging solutions using biodegradable materials and no chemical antimicrobial compounds, to ensure food quality and safety. This work involved the incorporation of Salmonella Enteritidis bacteriophage Felix O1, for potential use as an anti-Salmonella agent, into polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH) coatings and fibers deposited by casting and electrospinning on polyhydroxybutyrate/polyhydroxyvalerate (PHBV) films. PHBV films (pristine, with coating, and with nanofibers) were characterized in terms of water sensitivity, mechanical performance, morphology, and thermal properties. Additionally, X-ray diffraction and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy were performed to assess possible chemical modifications on PHBV films after PVOH deposition and the presence of bacteriophage. PVOH increased the moisture content from 5.98% (PHBV) to 8.94% and 8.28% for PHBV/coating films and PHBV/nanofiber films respectively, increased the solubility from 0% (PHBV) to 30.32% (PHBV/coating films) and to 32.42% (PHBV/nanofiber films), and increased the hydrophilicity of the films (contact angle of 76.31° for PHBV, 64.01° for PHBV/coating films and 30.90° for PHBV/nanofiber films), leading to an increased water affinity of their surface. Felix O1 was successfully added and maintained antimicrobial activity (106 titer) after the formation of the coating and nanofibers, demonstrating that these solutions can potentially be used in future packaging materials to avoid Salmonella contamination.

High levels of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in trumpet shell Charonia lampas from the Portuguese coast.		Toxins					Tetrodotoxin (TTX) is a potent neurotoxin, considered an emerging toxin in Europe where recently a safety limit of 44 g TTX kg-1 was recommended by authorities. In this study, three specimens of the large gastropod trumpet shell Charonia lampas bought in a market in south Portugal were analyzed using a neuroblastoma cell (N2a) based assay and by LC-MS/MS. N2a toxicity was observed in the viscera of two individuals analyzed and LC-MS/MS showed very high concentrations of TTX (42.1 mg kg-1) and 4,9-anhydroTTX (56.3 mg kg-1). A third compound with m/z 318 and structurally related with TTX was observed. In the edible portion, i.e., the muscle, toxin levels were below the EFSA recommended limit. This study shows that trumpet shell marine snails are seafood species that may reach the markets containing low TTX levels in the edible portion but containing very high levels of TTX in non-edible portion raising concerns regarding food safety if a proper evisceration is not carried out by consumers.

An update on ciguatoxins and CTX-like toxicity in fish from different trophic levels of the Selvagens Islands (NE Atlantic, Madeira, Portugal).		Toxins					The Selvagens Islands, which are a marine protected area located at the southernmost point of the Portuguese maritime zone, have been associated with fish harboring ciguatoxins (CTX) and linked to ciguatera fish poisonings. This study reports the results of a field sampling campaign carried out in September 2018 in these remote and rarely surveyed islands. Fifty-six fish specimens from different trophic levels were caught for CTX-like toxicity determination by cell-based assay (CBA) and toxin content analysis by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Notably, high toxicity levels were found in fish with an intermediate position in the food web, such as zebra seabream (Diplodus cervinus) and barred hogfish (Bodianus scrofa), reaching levels up to 0.75 g CTX1B equivalent kg-1. The LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that C-CTX1 was the main toxin, but discrepancies between CBA and LC-MS/MS in D. cervinus and top predator species, such as the yellowmouth barracuda (Sphyraena viridis) and amberjacks (Seriola spp.), suggest the presence of fish metabolic products, which need to be further elucidated. This study confirms that fish from coastal food webs of the Selvagens Islands represent a high risk of ciguatera, raising important issues for fisheries and environmental management of the Selvagens Islands. © 2021 by the authors.

Electrochemical and optical biosensing platforms for the immunorecognition of hazelnut Cor a 14 allergen.		Food Chemistry					Two immunosensors were advanced to target hazelnut Cor a 14 based on electrochemical and optical transduction. Both approaches were developed with two types of custom-made antibodies, namely anti-Cor a 14 IgG (rabbit) and anti-Cor a 14 IgY (hen's egg) targeting the Cor a 14 allergen. Antibody immobilisation was performed via EDC/NHS onto disposable screen-printed electrodes. The detection limit (LOD) of the electrochemical immunoassay for Cor a 14 was 5-times lower than the optical, being down to 0.05 fg mL-1 with a dynamic range of 0.1 fg mL-1 to 0.01 ng mL-1. Antibody selectivity was verified against non-target 2S albumins (potential cross-reactive plant species). Anti-C or a 14 IgY exhibited the best specificity, presenting minor cross-reactivity with peanut/walnut. Preliminary results of the application of anti-Cor a 14 IgY electrochemical immunosensor to incurred foods established a LOD of 1 mg kg-1 of hazelnut in wheat (0.16 mg kg-1 hazelnut protein).

Enzymes produced by solid state fermentation of agro-industrial by-products release ferulic acid in bioprocessed whole-wheat breads.		Food Research International					Solid-state fermentation (SSF) presents low cost and the possibility of adding value to waste by generating products rich in enzymes. The production of enzymes by SSF and its application in bakery have been previously reported separately in the literature. However, very few studies combine both approaches to evaluate the feasibility of applying enzymes produced by SSF to bread processing. The objective of this study was to use cocoa bean shell (CBS), wheat bran (WB) and brewer's spent grain (BSG) for enzyme production by SSF, and to evaluate their addition in breads. Three breads were produced: control bread (CB), bioprocessed bread added with fermented wheat bran (WBB) and bioprocessed bread added with fermented BSG (BSGB). Feruloyl esterase highest activities were 1,730 mU/g for WB fermented for 24 h and 1,128 mU/g for BSG fermented for 72 h. Xylanase highest activities were 547.9 U/g for BSG fermented for 48 h and 868.1 U/g for WB fermented for 72 h. CBS showed the lowest enzymatic activities. Bioprocessing breads with fermented WB and BSG led to an increase in soluble ferulic acid of 159% and 198%, respectively. The combination of SSF enzyme production and bread enzymatic bioprocessing strategies proved to be an effective green option for the valorization of agro-industrial by-products and the production of breads with enhanced ferulic acid content.

Characterization of Enterococcus faecium EO1 isolated from mutton and activity of bacteriocin-like substances in the control of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh mutton sausage.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteriocinogenic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from mutton carcasses after slaughter. The study also evaluated the activity of bacteriocin-like substances (BLS) for control of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh mutton sausage. The cell-free supernatant (CFS) was obtained and its antimicrobial activity was quantified. The presence of genes encoding enterocin was evaluated by molecular techniques. Another aspect assessed was the action in situ of BLS produced by these isolates for control of Listeria monocytogenes in fresh mutton sausage, experimentally contaminated. Six isolates presented phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of safety. Also, the antibacterial peptides present in the CFS showed stability at different temperatures, pH, NaCl and cure salt concentrations, as well as potential against L. monocytogenes Scott A. The isolate identified as Enterococcus faecium EO1 showed gene coding for the production of enterocin A and produced bacteriocin after 6 h of growth (400 AU.mL-1). Based on this, the CFS of EO1 (5 and 10%) was applied in fresh mutton sausage, being significantly effective for control of L. monocytogenes during 21 days of refrigerated storage (4.07 log CFU.g-1). Therefore, the potential for preservation of food has been demonstrated through the use of CFS containing bacteriocin-like substances from E. faecium EO1 in fresh mutton sausage.

Experimental characterization of starch/beet-pulp bricks for building applications: drying kinetics and mechanical behavior.		International Sugar Journal					Buildings account for a large share of the primary energy and materials use in Europe. Therefore, the EU has set several energy and materials targets for the built environment and other sectors. Novel low-carbon materials can play a major role in the transition towards meeting those targets. Moreover, agriculture produces by-or waste products that could be used as constituent of innovative agro-materials for construction. Recently, beet pulp based-material is being investigated on the material scale and promising results are pointed out regarding its interesting mechanical, hygrothermal and acoustical properties for building insulation use. In this context, the paper aims to study experimentally two types of beet-pulp starch composites: whole bricks and hollowed bricks. The manufacturing of the two types of bricks is detailed. A comparative study is then achieved regarding the drying kinetics, mechanical properties as well as internal structure composition.										2021	123	1466	137	138	0020-8841				10.1016/j.conbuildmat.2020.120270					FSTA:2021-07-Lc1198

Effect of die configuration on the physico-chemical properties, anti-nutritional compounds, and sensory features of legume-based extruded snacks.		Foods					Legumes are not valued by all consumers, mostly due to the prolonged soaking and cooking process they require. This problem could be solved by preparing legume-based ready-to-eat snacks. In this study, the effect of two different dies (circular and star-shaped, with cross-sections of 19.6 and 35.9 mm2, respectively) on the physico-chemical properties, anti-nutritional compounds, and sensory features of extruded breakfast snacks was determined. Extruded products were obtained from 100% legume flours of red lentil, faba bean, brown pea, and common bean. The extrusion-cooking conditions were 2.5g/s feed rate; 160 1°C die temperature; 16 1g/100g feed moisture, and 230 rpm screw speed. Star-shaped extrudates showed a lower expansion ratio, degree of starch gelatinization, and water solubility index, as well as higher bulk density, hardness, crunchiness, and lightness (L*) values. The oligosaccharides showed non univocal variations by changing the die, whereas phytates did not vary at all. The extrudates from lentil flour (richer in fiber) were the least preferred by sensory panelists, due to their hard texture. However, the spherical extrudates were preferred over the star-shaped product. These results emphasize the possibility of improving the physico-chemical and sensory properties of legume extrudates by selecting a proper die. © 2021 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					The study examines Parental Feeding Practices (PFP) in relation to adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MD) and children's weight status. It's a cross-sectional study of 402 parents (68.4% mothers), with children aged 2-12 years. Parents completed the Comprehensive Parental Feeding Questionnaire and the Mediterranean Diet Quality Index for children and adolescents (KIDMED), evaluating children's adherence to the MD. Logistic regression showed that in children aged 2-<6 years, "emotion regulation/food as reward" and "pressure" decrease MD adherence (OR=0.186, p<0.0001 and OR=0.496, p=0.004), and "monitoring" decrease excess body weight (OR=0.284, p=0.009). In older children (6-12 years), "Healthy eating guidance" and "monitoring" increase MD adherence (OR=3.262, p=0.001 and OR=3.147, p<0.0001), "child control" decreases MD adherence (OR=0.587, p=0.049), "pressure" decrease excess body weight (OR=0.495, p<0.0001) and "restriction" increase excess body weight (OR=1.784, p=0.015). "Healthy eating guidance" and "monitoring" seem to be the best PFP employed, in terms of children's MD adherence and weight status. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The impact of food model system structure on the inactivation of Listeria innocua by cold atmospheric plasma and nisin combined treatments.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Novel processing methods such as cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) and natural antimicrobials like nisin, are of interest to replace traditional food decontamination approaches as, due to their mild nature, they can maintain desirable food characteristics, i.e., taste, texture, and nutritional content. However, the microbial growth characteristics (planktonic growth/surface colonies) and/or the food structure itself (liquid/solid surface) can impact the inactivation efficacy of these novel processing methods. More specifically, cells grown as colonies on a solid(like) surface experience a completely different growth environment to cells grown planktonically in liquid, and thus could display a different response to novel processing treatments through stress adaptation and/or cross protection mechanisms. The order in which combined treatments are applied could also impact their efficacy, especially if the mechanisms of action are complementary. This work presents a fundamental study on the efficacy of CAP and nisin, alone and combined, as affected by food system structure. More specifically, Listeria innocua was grown planktonically (liquid broth) or on a viscoelastic Xanthan gum gel system (1.5% w/v) and treated with CAP, nisin, or a combination of the two. Both the inactivation system, i.e., liquid versus solid(like) surface and the growth characteristics, i.e., planktonic versus colony growth, were shown to impact the treatment efficacy. The combination of nisin and CAP was more effective than individual treatments, but only when nisin was applied before the CAP treatment. This study provides insight into the environmental stress response/adaptation of L. innocua grown on structured systems in response to natural antimicrobials and novel processing technologies, and is a step towards the faster delivery of these food decontamination methods from the bench to the food industry.

J		Costo, R.; Sanz, P. D.; Guignon, B.							Pressure-induced modification of sodium caseinate techno-functional properties.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Sodium caseinate (NaCas) is a quite common ingredient for the manufacture of food products because of its multiple techno-functional properties. These properties might be enhanced or impaired by high-pressure treatment, which could be employed both, as a preservation treatment or for transformation purposes. To check whether pressure could be able to produce changes in the techno-functional properties of NaCas, aqueous solutions of NaCas at mass fractions of 0.026, and 0.052 were prepared and treated under pressures of 200 or 600 MPa during 15 min at 15, 30, or 60 °C. Changes in turbidity, viscosity, foaming, gel-forming, and emulsifying properties of the NaCas solutions before and after pressure-temperature treatments were measured. Turbidity analyses showed that casein aggregates were significantly modified after pressure treatments at 30 °C and 60 °C. Several techno-functional properties of NaCas dispersions were concomitantly affected. This study suggests that some properties as viscosity, foamability, or water holding capacity are affected by high-pressure treatments but as these changes are below 20%, NaCas should be considered as a pressure-proof additive. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Influence of different commercial yeasts on volatile fraction of sparkling wines.		Foods					The occurrence of aroma constituents in sparkling wines, with direct impact on their organoleptic characteristics, is affected by several factors, for example the base-wine particularities, grapes cultivar conditions, inoculated yeasts, the aging stage, and wine-making practices. This study evaluated the influence of different four commercial yeasts (IOC FIZZ, IOC DIVINE, LEVULIA CRISTAL, and IOC 18-2007) on the volatile composition of experimental sparkling wines. For this, five sparkling wines variants from the Muscat Ottonel grape variety were obtained. The base-wine was obtained through reverse osmosis and had a predetermined alcoholic concentration (10.5% vol.). In order to fulfill the proposed purpose, the experimental sparkling wines were characterized by the physical-chemical parameters (according to International Organization of Vine and Wine methods of analysis), volatile fraction (using gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry technique), and sensory descriptors. Data showed a key impact on the concentration of the volatile constituents (p< 0.05), depending on the type of inoculated yeast for the second fermentation. Regarding the sensory analysis, important differences can be observed due to the type of inoculated yeast. Only a minor influence on the physical-chemical parameters was registered. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cotovanu, I.; Mironeasa, S.							Impact of different amaranth particle sizes addition level on wheat flour dough rheology and bread features.		Foods					The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the effects generated by amaranth flour (AF)-of different particle sizes (PS) added to white wheat flour from 0% to 20%-on the proximate composition, dough rheological behavior, and bread technological parameters. The reduction of particle size led to an increased hydration capacity of the wheat-amaranth composite flour, while bulk density decreased. Increasing the amount of AF and decreasing the PS led to a significant increase in protein, lipids, and ash contents, while the moisture and carbohydrates of the composite flour decreased. Increasing AF addition led to an increase in dough tenacity and a decrease in dough extensibility, while the PS had an irregular trend. The large particle size, at 15% and 20% levels of AF in wheat flour, increased significantly (p< 0.001) the dough tenacity and hardness, bread firmness, but decreased bread volume, porosity, and elasticity, while medium and small particles at 5-15% addition levels improved porosity and elasticity of the composite bread. Significant correlations (p< 0.05) were found between proximate composition, dough rheological characteristics, and bread quality for the wheat-amaranth composite flours. The results of this study are an important basis for the development of innovative wheat-amaranth bread recipes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cotrim, W. da S.; Coimbra, J. C.; Cotrim, K. C. F.							Modeling and simulation of broiler carcass precooling by computational fluid dynamics.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					There are few studies with mathematical models representative of the effect of agitation on the poultry carcass cooling. Thus, the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technique was applied in the modeling and simulation of this process. Two process conditions were studied: (a) without agitation (NA) by recirculation (0 m3 hr-1) and (b) with agitation (WA) by recirculation (8 m3 hr-1). The simulation was performed in the software ANSYS 18.2 in a steady-state step, for the fluid flow, followed by a transient step (60min), for the heat transfer. In NA condition R2 is equal to 0.9959 and NRMSE (%) of 6.32%. WA condition obtained R2 equal to 0.9923 and NRMSE (%) of 6.39%. The final temperatures were 7.11 and 5.31 °C, for recirculation flows of 0 and 8 m3 hr-1, respectively. Increases in the volumetric flow of recirculation have a positive effect on reducing the time required for reaching the final temperature of the carcass. Practical Applications. We demonstrate that the CFD model was able to adequately predict the temperature drop profile inside the carcass, overcoming the capacity of traditional empirical models. The CFD model was sensitive to the effects of the cooling water turbulence. It was possible to numerically demonstrate that the turbulence generated by the agitation of the cooling water by recirculation causes a positive effect on the cooling rate of the carcasses. The results point to the possibility of using CFD modeling to optimize the equipment and the precooling process of poultry carcasses. Such optimization can represent a reduction in energy consumption for cold water production or even a reduction in precooling time, which contributes to the environmental sustainability and microbiological safety of poultry meat. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	6			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13693					FSTA:2021-10-Sn5681

Food Control					Consumption of plant-based products and meat alternatives has been rising for a few years, with vegetarian and vegan diets gaining more and more popularity. To comply with legislation and maintain consumers' trust, food manufacturers of vegan products must ensure the absence of animal residues in these products. A real-time PCR method targeting the 16S mitochondrial rRNA gene from vertebrates has been developed in order to detect the presence of vertebrate material in plant-based ingredients and finished products. The reaction successfully amplified on mammals, birds, reptiles and fish samples only. The analysis of plant-based samples spiked at 0.1% (w/w) with meat or fish materials confirmed the sensitivity of the method at this level, considered as the limit for unintended presence of animal residues by the European Vegetarian Union. The method was applied to commercialized vegan finished products from European markets and confirmed the absence of animal material in all the tested samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Science					Brewing is the final and key step in the production of the coffee beverage. Extraction related metrics such as the total dissolved solids (TDS), percentage extraction yield (PE) of solutes, and brew temperature (BT) are widely believed to govern the flavor and corresponding consumer acceptance of the resulting brew, as summarized in the industry standard "Coffee Brewing Control Chart. " In this study, we investigated how the three factors of TDS, PE, and BT affected consumer acceptance of a medium roast, single-origin coffee and whether consumer preference segmentation would be observed based on these variables. A cohort of 118 mostly college-age, self-reported consumers of black coffee tasted coffees that varied in BT, TDS, and PE. For each coffee, consumers rated overall acceptance on the 9-point hedonic scale; the adequacy of serving temperature, flavor intensity, acidity, and mouthfeel using 5-point just-about-right (JAR) scales; and described the flavor using a check-all-that-apply list of 17 attributes. Cluster analysis revealed two consumer segments whose preferences varied most strongly with TDS. Response surface methodology relating liking to TDS and PE produced dome-and saddle-shaped surfaces for the two segments, respectively. External preference mapping and penalty analysis indicated that overall flavor intensity as well as acidity heavily influenced the preferences of the two clusters. The Coffee Brewing Control Chart's "ideal" coffee should therefore be reconsidered to reflect consumer preference segmentation. Practical Application. This research informs the way coffee brewers manipulate brew strength and extraction of drip brew coffee for optimal consumer acceptance; and justifies a reform of the standard "Coffee Brewing Control Chart" in its representation of an "ideal" coffee as we uncovered two consumer preference segments with different positive and negative sensory drivers of liking. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Cotti, C. D.; Gordanier, J. M.; Ozturk, O. D.							Does distributing SNAP benefits later in the month smooth expenditures?		Food Policy					In this paper, we explore whether the alignment of the date a household receives Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits with the start of the calendar month affects the smoothness of household monthly expenditures. Across states, what day in the calendar month households receive SNAP benefits varies substantially. Further, other income sources (including transfer payments) and many regular household expenditures (e.g., rent) tend to arrive near the beginning of the calendar month. If alignment of SNAP benefit receipt with the start of the calendar month reduces expenditure smoothing, there may be important health and behavioral impacts for the SNAP population. Our main result is that increasing the median SNAP distribution date in a state by 10 days reduces the standard deviation of weekly spending by 0.23 dollars or approximately 6.5% for SNAP-eligible households. Results. Are robust to alternative measures of SNAP date distribution and expenditure smoothing.

This work considers the use of fluorescence spectroscopy to study the effects of the presence of microorganisms in the chicken's meat and therefore, how the detection of this presence can help on food safety . The fluorescence of organic boneless and skinless chicken breast pieces contaminated with variable concentrations of E. coli cells inoculated in meat (104, 105, 106, and 107 cells/mL) was measured with excitations at 340 and 410 nm. Raman spectra were obtained to investigate into conformational changes in the collagen structures, from samples kept for 48 h at 25 °C (non-contaminated and contaminated with E. coli, 105 and 107 cells/mL). Protoporphyrin IX fluorescence lifetime was measured in the function of an increased number of E. coli cells. The obtained results of E. coli were compared to the ones of Salmonella and Campylobacter contaminations (106 cells/mL). Some uncommon aspects were found in the spectra of the contaminated meat: enlargement of the collagen band at 400 nm; increase in free reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide fluorescence intensity around 505 nm; and decrease of flavin emission band. A shortening in the porphyrin emission lifetime (from ~10 ns for uncontaminated meat to ~5 ns) was observed, showing a quenching process for the meat contaminated with E. coli. The presence of coproporphyrin emission band was observed in the samples contaminated with Salmonella. The singularities observed in PpIX fluorescence spectroscopy for E. coli and Salmonella can be used to obtain a quick detection method of pathogenic bacteria. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Immobilization of peroxidase on textile carrier materials and their application in the bleaching of colored whey.		Journal of Dairy Science					Textiles represent promising support materials for enzymes. The goal of the present work was to investigate the immobilization of commercial peroxidase on a polyester needle felt and the repeated use in the gentle degradation of norbixin in whey from dairy cheese as a practical application. High enzyme loads were obtained by a 2-step immobilization procedure. First, the number of functional groups on the textile surface was increased by a modification with amino-functional polyvinylamine. Second, the enzyme was immobilized by using 2 types of crosslinking agents. Due to the iron content of peroxidase, inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry was used for the quantitative determination of the enzyme load on the textile. The enzyme activity was evaluated using common 2,2'-azino-di-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) assay for peroxidases. By the variation of enzyme input and crosslinker concentration, a maximal enzyme load of 80 mg/g of textile was achieved, and a maximum specific activity of 57 U/g of textile. For the visualization of the enzyme on the fiber surface, fluorescence microscopy as well as scanning probe microscopy were used. The immobilized peroxidase showed significant activity, even after 50 reuse cycles. In addition, the potential of the new support and enzyme combination in commercial whey bleaching was demonstrated successfully on a 10-L scale. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Green banana starch enhances physicochemical and sensory quality of baru almond-based fermented product with probiotic bacteria.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study aimed to isolate and characterise green banana starch (GBS) and to investigate the effect of adding 0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, 4.5% and 6.0% GBS on physicochemical and sensory properties of a fermented product based on baru almond (Dipteryx alata Vogel) water extract with probiotic bacteria. GBS showed high gelatinisation temperature (73.37 °C), enthalpy (16.61 J g-1) and final viscosity (239.6 RVU). On the contrary, it showed a low tendency to retrograde (67.53 RVU), water solubility (0.02%), water absorption (1.85 g g-1) and gel hardness (6.7 N). Higher addition levels of GBS increased firmness, reduced syneresis and positively affected pH, titratable acid, soluble solids and colour of baru almond-based fermented products. The incorporation of 4.5% GBS was well accepted and preferred over the control sample (no GBS addition). GBS can be used as a natural thickener. The baru almond-based fermented product with 4.5% GBS stands out for having potential probiotic properties and for being a promising dairy alternative. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to evaluate the consumers' perception (n = 1085) about processing chocolate milk drinks by cold plasma. The consumers were asked about food technology neophobia, familiarity and, willingness to buy the product, sensory attributes, and perceived quality compared to traditional technologies. The consumers considered that new technologies could have a negative impact on health, natural quality of the product, and environment, that the benefits of the new technologies are overstated, and that could be a risk replacing the traditional technologies. However, most of the consumers (72.3%) were willing to buy the chocolate milk drink processed by cold plasma, mainly if the price is similar to that of the conventional product. Chocolate milk drink should have a brown color, chocolate flavor, typical chocolate and milk taste, and high consistency. The willingness to buy the new product increases with the belief that the new technologies would not bring negative health effects, while it decreases with the unfamiliarity with new technologies, doubts about the information provided by the media, or no perceived quality compared to the traditional technology. Therefore, it is important that the food industry provide consumers with trustable, understandable, and clear information so that the lack of confidence could be overcome.

Characterization, techno-functional properties, and encapsulation efficiency of self-assembled beta-lactoglobulin nanostructures.		Food Chemistry					Whey is a cheese co-product with high protein content used in the food industry due to its techno-functional properties and nutritive value. This study aims to optimize the production of beta-lactoglobulin (beta-lg) nanostructures, to characterize their techno-functional properties and stability, and to apply them as a carrier of bioactive molecules. Box-Behnken planning was applied to determine the best conditions to obtain the beta-lg nanostructure, which consists in treatment at 100 °C in NaCl 50 mmol.L-1 for 60 min. TEM analysis showed a fibril structure in the observed nanostructures. The nanostructured systems formed foam and emulsion with higher stability than the systems composed of the native protein. The results for encapsulation efficiency of bioactive compounds were 96.50%, 89.04%, 67.78%, and 36.39% for quercetin, rutin, naringin, and vitamin B2, respectively. Thus, beta-lg nanostructure's great capacity to encapsulate hydrophobic molecules was verified.

Immobilization of baker's yeast in the alginate-based hydrogels to impart sensorial characteristics to frozen dough bread.		Food Bioscience					The objective of this study was to improve the sensorial characteristics of frozen dough bread by replacing free yeast cells with calcium alginate-yeast cells (CAY) or calcium alginate-starch yeast cells (CASY) hydrogels. Alginate-starch increased encapsulation efficiency by 18.7% compared with alginate-based encapsulation. Frozen storage affected the viability of all yeast cells, particularly free yeast cells, followed by yeasts encapsulated in CAY and CASY. The sensory evaluation of bread baked from both fresh and frozen doughs revealed that the highest scores for crust color and firmness, taste, smell, and overall acceptability were awarded to bread baked using dough containing CAY-encapsulated yeast that was subjected to 3-months storage. The scores obtained for crumb texture and specific volume (3.61 and 4.5, respectively) for frozen dough bread containing CAY-encapsulated yeast were similar to the highest scores, which were awarded to bread made from fresh dough with free yeast cells (3.63 and 4.84, respectively). These results indicated that the immobilization of baker's yeast in an alginate-based hydrogel could represent a viable solution for overcoming yeast cryosensitivity, allowing for the production of frozen dough bread with improved sensorial characteristics, which would be highly acceptable by consumers and opening new avenues for the economic sector of frozen baked good products.

E.; Yasmina Sultanbawa							Can infrared spectroscopy detect adulteration of kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) dry powder with synthetic ascorbic acid?		Food Analytical Methods					Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana) fruit is characterised by its high levels of natural ascorbic acid compared with other domesticated plants in the world (e.g. more than 75 times that of oranges). The concentration of ascorbic acid is one of the main factors that define the price of this fruit (as fresh or dry powder) in the market. As many other specialty foods and commodities, this food is not exempt against adulteration. Adulteration can be simply performed by the addition of water (dilution), low-quality fruit and synthetic ascorbic acid and other chemical products. The ability of attenuated total reflectance mid infrared spectroscopy (ATR-MIR) was evaluated as a tool to detect the level of adulteration of Kakadu plum powder with a synthetic source of ascorbic acid. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the standard error of cross validation (SECV) obtained for the prediction of level and source of adulteration were 0.85 (3.2%), and 0.83 (0.30%) respectively. This study demonstrated that the integration of ATR-MIR spectroscopy with chemometric analysis could be a valuable method to identify the adulteration of Kakadu plum powder with synthetic sources of ascorbic acid. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

The use of vibrational spectroscopy to predict vitamin C in Kakadu plum powders (Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell, Combretaceae).		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of using either mid-infrared (MIR) or near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to predict the vitamin C content in Kakadu plum (Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell, Combretaceae) powder samples. Vitamin C is the main and quality-determining bioactive compound in Kakadu plum (KP). Kakadu plum powder samples were analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a photodiode array detector (UPLC-PDA) and scanned using both MIR and NIR spectroscopy. Results. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the standard error in cross validation (SECV) for vitamin C were 0.93 and 1811mg 100g dry weight (DW) and 0.91 and 1839 mg 100g DW using MIR and NIR spectroscopy, respectively. The coefficient of correlation and the standard error of prediction (SEP) obtained using the independent set (n = 5) were 0.65 (SEP: 2367mg 100g DW) and 0.73 (SEP: 4773mg 100g DW) using MIR and NIR spectroscopy, respectively. Conclusions. The results obtained in this study clearly showed that it is possible to calibrate IR spectroscopic instruments for the measurement of vitamin C in KP plum powder samples. Mid-infrared spectroscopy showed the most promising results; however, Fourier transform near-infrared (FTNIR) spectroscopy also produced models capable of good quantification of this important bioactive compound and vitamin. These findings are promising in terms of using high-throughput IR spectroscopy as a routine technology to determine vitamin C in plant-based foods and derived products. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Profiles of volatile and phenolic compounds as markers of ripening stage in candonga strawberries.		Foods					Volatile compounds, quality traits (total phenols and antioxidant capacity) and High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-isolated polyphenols of strawberries, variety Sabrosa, commercially referred to as "Candonga", harvested at three different times (H1, H2 and H3) and at two different ripening stages, namely half-red (Half-red-H1, Half-red-H2 and Half-red-H3) and red (Red-H1, Red-H2 and Red-H3) were evaluated. Dominant anthocyanins, namely cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-O-glucoside and pelargonidin-3-O-rutinoside, as well as p-coumaryl hexoside increased during harvesting, differently from flavonoids, such as quercetin-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-3-O-glucoronide and quercetin 3-O-glucoronide, that declined. Samples clustered in different quadrants of the principal component analysis (PCA) performed on volatiles, quality traits and phenolic compounds, highlighting that only the red samples were directly correlated to volatile components, as volatiles clearly increased both in number and amount during ripening. In particular, volatiles with a positive impact on the consumers' acceptance, including butyl butyrate, ethyl hexanoate, hexyl acetate, nonanal, terpenes and lactones, were positively associated with the Red-H1 and Red-H2 strawberries, while volatiles with negative coefficients related to consumer liking, including isopropyl butyrate, isoamyl butyrate and mesifurane directly correlated with the Red-H3 samples. Accordingly, strawberries harvested at Red-H1 and Red-H2 ripening stages could be preferred by the consumers compared to the Red-H3 fruit. Altogether, these results could help to individuate quality traits as putative markers of the ripening stage, and optimize the process of post-harvesting ripening to preserve or improve the desirable aromatic characteristics of strawberries. © 2021 by the authors.

Landraces.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Volatile and phenolic compounds of four onion landraces (Airola, Alifana, Montoro and Vatolla) cultivated in Campania region (southern Italy) were compared. Overall, 31 volatiles were identified in the four landraces including: sulfur metabolites (19), aldehydes (7), alcohols (2), acids (2) and others (3). Phenolic compounds, assigned using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) and semi-quantified by HPLC coupled with a diode array detector, varied from 297.3 to 1348.3 mg/kg fresh onion. Principal Component Analysis performed on volatiles and phenolic compounds revealed a relatively high inter-and intra-landrace variability, since the relative concentration of individual volatile and phenolic components varied within ample ranges. The four landraces could be distinguished with sound confidence by attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometric analysis of the fresh bulb skin. The qualitative and semi-quantitative volatile profiles of Airola onions were distinct among each other, indicating sensorial peculiarity of this landrace. The presence of 2-methylfuran differentiated the five Vatolla samples, as the remaining landraces lacked it. Altogether, these results could support consumers' choices toward onion varieties with higher potential health benefits on a molecular basis and encourage future biodiversity programs to preserve onion landraces exhibiting valuable genetic resources.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Overall 90 volatile compoundswere recognized in well-watered and mild drought-stressed samples of two wild Iranian ecotypes of S. reuterana Boiss., namely S. reuterana A and S. reuterana B, and of S. officinalis L. (control) during the main phenological stages (vegetative, pre-flowering and flowering). In water-stressed S. officinalis the total level of volatiles increased (50, 03%) at the vegetative stage, while it decreased (-11, 11%) at the flowering stage. In drought-stressed S. reuterana A, volatiles amount decreased both at vegetative (-74, 62%) and pre-flowering (-31, 34%) stages, whereas control and water-stressed S. reuterana B showed similar volatile levels in all the stages. The Orthogonal Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) revealed that, excluding S. officinalis at the flowering stage, control and drought-stressed samples can be differentiated based on their volatile contents and despite the phenological stage. Moreover, OPLS-DA indicated that linalool and p-methylanisole can be considered putative biomarkers of the water deficit conditions in S. officinalis and S. reuterana A. Finally, as, when cultivated, S. reuterana A and S. officinalis seemed to show similar volatiles patterns, the cultivation of the Iranian ecotype A could provide a valuable source of natural antioxidants for the preparation of novel functional foods, pharmaceutical and cosmetics ingredients.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), quality attributes (respiration activity, total phenols and antioxidant activity) and olfactory profile by electronic nose of fresh-cut orange and purple Polignano carrots stored in Air or passive modified atmosphere (pMAP) were examined until 14 days of storage. The pMAP storage reduced the respiration rate, preserving the antioxidant activity and total phenols of the carrots. Moreover, it enhanced the peculiar aromatic notes of these carrots, as showed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which allowed also to select the VOCs associated to fresh carrots and to samples stored in Air or pMAP. Predictive models of selected volatiles by electronic nose data were build running Partial least squares regression (PLSR). In orange carrots, six significant models were obtained for beta-pinene, delta-elemene, gamma-curcumene, cis alpha-bisabolene, cariophyllene oxide and alpha-cedrol. In the case of purple carrots, E-nose signals were able to predict only two terpenes, trans beta-cariophyllene and myristicin. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The use of pulsed light to inactivate Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts on high-risk commodities (Cilantro, mesclun lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes).		Food Control					Pulsed light (PL) is an emerging technology with potential applications in food processing. This study investigated the impact of PL treatment on the viability of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts inoculated onto cilantro, mesclun lettuce, spinach, and tomatoes. A light with pulses at wavelengths of 180-1100 nm, generated at 3 pulses/s with a pulse width of 360 mus was used. Samples were treated for 0, 10, 45, and 90 s at a working distance of 40 cm. Oocyst viability was determined using an HCT-8 cell culture infectivity assay. The maximum log reductions (log genomic copies) achieved on cilantro, mesclun lettuce, spinach, and tomato were 2.4, 4.3, 2.5, and 2.2, respectively. Significant changes in color values (CIE L*, a*, b*) were not observed in leafy greens or herbs; however, wilting was observed in samples treated longer than 10s. Significant change in the b* value for tomato treated for 90 s was observed. Pulsed light can reduce the infectivity of C. parvum oocysts on cilantro, mesclun, lettuce, spinach, and tomato and with further optimization could have potential applications in post-harvest processing of these commodities.

Journal of Food Science					American craft brewers are targeting barley malt as a novel source of flavor and As a means of differentiation. However, fundamental tools have only recently emerged to aid barley breeders in supporting this effort, such as the hot steep malt sensory method, a wort preparation method recently approved by the American Society of Brewing Chemists for evaluation of extractable malt flavor. The primary objective of this study was to determine if insights into beer liking and sensory attributes can be gained through hot steep malt sensory using an untrained panel of craft beer consumers (n = 95). We evaluated consumer acceptance of hot steep and beer samples of different barley genotypes using a 9-point hedonic scale, check-all-that-apply (CATA), and open comment during separate sensory panels. Beers brewed with Washington State University breeding lines (n = 4), selected for all-malt craft brewing, generally had higher consumer acceptance than the industry-standard control variety (CDC Copeland). Genotype had a significant influence on the consumer acceptance of beer aroma, appearance, taste/flavor, sweetness, and overall liking but only on hot steep appearance. Significant differences between genotypes were found for 18% (fruity and other) and 46% (chemical, citrus, earthy, fruity, stale, and sweet aromatic) of CATA attributes for the hot steep and beer panels, respectively. Hot steep and beer liking and sensory attributes had low correlation coefficients. For example, beer overall liking was negatively correlated with chemical (r = -0.338, p< 0.0001) and positively correlated with fruity (r = 0.265, p< 0.0001). This study demonstrates that untrained craft beer consumers can better differentiate among genotypes using beers than hot steep samples. Practical Application. In general, Washington State University barley breeding lines had higher consumer acceptance than the control variety, CDC Copeland. Each genotype had a distinctive beer flavor profile, such as 12WA_120.14 (fruity and sweet aromatic), which had the highest consumer acceptance ratings, and 10WA_107.43 (citrus), which has been released as the variety "Palmer." The results illustrate that the use of different barley genotypes presents varied sensory properties in the final beer and that particular malt and beer sensory attributes may influence consumer acceptance. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Cramer, H.; Lehnberger, A.							Seed massecuite production by a crystal seeding plant.		International Sugar Journal					Controlled crystal growth is the real challenge in crystallisation. Particularly at the beginning of the process, when the crystals are still very small and have a low volume concentration in the vacuum pan, undesired secondary nucleation can take place and is regularly observed in sugar factory practices. Crystal seed plants that have been commissioned in cane sugar factories clearly show that crystallisation by cooling allows the production of a seed massecuite with a stable and reproducible crystal quality, even from high-purity syrups. The technology that is used in beet sugar production can be used in exactly the same way in cane sugar production. The benefits that arise are the stable production capacity of the entire sugar house and the enhanced quality of the final product. Examples are given of crystal seed plants that have been integrated into sugar houses, to illustrate the successful implementation of this crystallisation concept.

Toxins					Several classes of non-antibiotic drugs, including psychoactive drugs, proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and others, appear to have strong antimicrobial properties. We considered whether psychoactive drugs induce the SOS response in E. coli bacteria and, consequently, induce Shiga toxins in Shiga-toxigenic E. coli (STEC). We measured the induction of an SOS response using a recA-lacZ E. coli reporter strain, as RecA is an early, reliable, and quantifiable marker for activation of the SOS stress response pathway. We also measured the production and release of Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2) from a classic E. coli O157:H7 strain, derived from a food-borne outbreak due to spinach. Some, but not all, serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and antipsychotic drugs induced an SOS response. The use of SSRIs is widespread and increasing; thus, the use of these antidepressants could account for some cases of hemolytic-uremic syndrome due to STEC and is not attributable to antibiotic administration. SSRIs could have detrimental effects on the normal intestinal microbiome in humans. In addition, as SSRIs are resistant to environmental breakdown, they could have effects on microbial communities, including aquatic ecosystems, long after they have left the human body. © 2021 by the authors.

Applicability of Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms tests as indicators for Cronobacter in milk powder factory environments.		Food Microbiology					The emergence of Cronobacter as an important potential pathogen for newborn children and its occurrence in powdered infant formulae has generated a need to develop new management practices for this food group. This includes reduction of the prevalence of Cronobacter in manufacturing environments which can be a source of Cronobacter. This study was performed to assess the suitability of qualitative and quantitative Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms indicator tests for the presence and prevalence of Cronobacter. Environmental swabs (205) from five milk powder factories were examined. The qualitative indicator tests had good sensitivity but they lacked specificity for reliable routine use. Logistic regression analyses revealed a significant relationship between the quantitative indicator tests and Cronobacter prevalence, where the Enterobacteriaceae count was a slightly stronger predictor for Cronobacter than the coliforms count. The optimum test sensitivity (81%) and specificity (66%) was obtained when the indicator count thresholds were set at ≥1 cfu/cm2. However, since 11% of samples were Cronobacter positive when counts of Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms were less than 1 cfu/cm2, specific testing for Cronobacter is advised in addition to Enterobacteriaceae testing to minimise risk of transfer of Cronobacter from the factory environment into powdered infant formulae products.

Urso, G., d'						LC-ESI/LTQOrbitrap/MS metabolomic analysis of fennel waste (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) as a byproduct rich in bioactive compounds.		Foods					Food industries produce a high amount of waste every year. These wastes represent a source of bioactive compounds to be used to produce cosmetic and nutraceutical products. In this study, the possibility to retrain food waste as a potential source of bioactive metabolites is evaluated. In particular, metabolite profiles of different parts (bulb, leaves, stems and little stems) of fennel waste were investigated by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/LTQ Orbitrap MS). To discriminate the different plant parts, a Multivariate Data Analysis approach was developed. Metabolomic analysis allowed the identification of different metabolites mainly belonging to hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, flavonoid glycosides, flavonoid aglycons, phenolic acids, iridoid derivatives and lignans. The identification of compounds was based on retention times, accurate mass measurements, MS/MS data, exploration on specific metabolites database and comparison with data reported in the literature for F. vulgare. Moreover, the presence of different oxylipins was relieved; these metabolites for the first time were identified in fennel. Most of the metabolites identified in F. vulgare possess anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and/or immunomodulatory properties. Considering that polyphenols are described to possess antioxidant activity, spectrophotometric tests were performed to evaluate the antioxidant activity of each part of the fennel. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					The epitopes of the major allergen of pine nut, Pin p 1, were analyzed using a peptide library and sera from patients with clinical allergy to pine nut in order to deepen into the allergenic characteristics of Pin p 1. Analyses of epitope similarities and epitopes location in a 3D-model were also performed. Results. Showed that three main regions of Pin p 1 containing 5 epitopes were recognized by patient sera IgE. The epitopes of Pin p 1 had important similarities with epitopes of allergenic 2S albumins from peanut (Ara h 2 and 6) and Brazil nut (Ber e 1). The epitopes of Pin p 1 were found in alpha-helices and coils in the 3D protein structure. Interestingly, all epitopes were found to be well-exposed in the protein surface, which suggests facile access for IgE-binding to the structure of Pin p 1 which is known to be highly resistant.

Bioaccumulation of selenium-by fruit origin lactic acid bacteria in tropical fermented fruit juices.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Adequate fruit consumption helps to prevent several chronic age-related diseases. Selenium (Se) is an elemental micronutrient with antioxidant capacity. In general, fruits and Se ingest by humans are below the recommended daily intake value. Fresh fruits are highly susceptible to deterioration during storage. Fermentation can improve the storage period, sensory profile, and bioactive compound content of foods; moreover, some lactic acid bacteria can accumulate organic Se intracellularly. In this work, microbial growth and Se accumulation by Levilactobacillus brevis CRL2051 and Fructobacillus tropaeoli CRL2034 in tropical fruit juices were evaluated. The strains could grow 1-2 log cfu/mL, alone or combined, in mango, passion fruit, and mango/passion fruit juices, although they could not completely eliminate native microorganisms in unpasteurised juices. In pasteurised trials, both strains consumed fruit carbohydrates producing lactic acid, in addition to acetic acid, and mannitol by F. tropaeoli. Both strains accumulated Se intracellularly in the fruit juices, especially (123.0 mug/L) in the passion fruit juice fermented by the mixed culture. Finally, the Fructobacillus strain increased 3.42 times the phenolic compound concentration in the mango/passion fruit juice with added Se after 24 h. The assayed LAB strains could be used for preparing functional fermented fruit beverages bio-enriched in Se.

Differences in salivary flow and composition between age groups are correlated to dynamic retronasal aroma perception during wine consumption.		Food Quality and Preference					Salivary flow and composition have been related to the dynamics of retronasal aroma release during wine consumption. However, whether differences in saliva composition among age groups are related to wine aroma perception remains unexplored. Therefore, the aim of this work has been to determine the relationship between salivary parameters and the dynamics of wine retronasal aroma perception in two groups of individuals of different age (young and senior adults). To do so, 22 individuals, 11 from the young group (18-35 years old) and another 11 from the senior group (>55 y.o.) were recruited for this study. The retronasal aroma intensity of two specific aroma attributes (smoked and black pepper) of a red wine was rated by using Time-Intensity (TI) methodology. Saliva was previously collected from each individual. Salivary flow and composition (pH, total protein content, protease and alpha-amylase activities) were determined in order to characterise the two groups of panellists. Results. Showed significant differences among age groups (young and seniors) in the TI parameters extracted from the dynamics curves of retronasal aroma perception of both attributes. Thus, smoky and black pepper notes were more intensely rated and for longer times by the senior group than by the younger group. Salivary parameters were also significantly different in both age groups. A significant positive correlation between the salivary total protein content and the maximum intensity (Imax) perceived, and a significant negative correlation between the salivary flow and most TI parameters (Imax, area under the curve and duration time of the perceived stimuli) were found for both aroma attributes.

Journal of Food Science					The edible coating has been used for covering fruits and vegetables, bringing surface protection, and extending product shelf-life. Due to the outstanding properties, nanomaterials have become a part of the packaging/coating new generation, demonstrating improvements in the barrier capacity of materials starting from construction products to the food industry. In the food industry, on the other hand, Agaricus bisporus mushrooms have a limited shelf-life from 1 to 3 days because of their high respiration rate and enzymatic browning. With the aim to reduce these two parameters and prevent rapid senescence, the objective of this study was to incorporate a natural source of nanomaterials (cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) into a gellan gum-based coating and sprayed the surface of the mushrooms with the coating material. To evaluate the effect of CNCs, oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production rate, and color change were recorded during the mushroom storage at 41 °C. Results showed that all coatings were able to decrease total color change (DeltaE) of mushrooms from 12 to 8 at day 10 when the coating was applied in all samples compared to control. In addition, significant differences were observed in the respiration rate when CNCs were added to the mushrooms. Oxygen consumption results exhibited a 44 mL O2/kg. Day production at day 5 with 20% CNCs compared to 269 mL O2/kg. Day observed in noncoated samples. This trend was similarly observed in the carbon dioxide production rate. Practical Application. With this research, it was remarkable to see the presence of CNCs in the coating solution reduced the respiration rate and increased the shelf-life of mushrooms. Similar applications can be industrially scaled-up to protect fruits and vegetables by CNCs-based coating or packaging materials. A variety of sustainable materials are available nowadays that serve as packaging matrix, and scientists are working on expanding the compatibility of these nanomaterials. In addition, it has been studied that CNCs enhance the degradation of polymers, an effort that many companies are making to reduce the environmental impact in their products. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	2	420	425	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15580					FSTA:2021-05-Jq7011

Influence of fruit destoning on bioactive compounds of virgin olive oil.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Fruit destoning before crushing is gaining interest due to this operation enhances the working capacity, reduces the waste generation, and improves the quality of virgin olive oil (VOO). Despite these benefits, the influence of olives destoning on the concentration of bioactive compounds in VOO has not been evaluated. In this research, we studied the changes occurring in two different families of bioactive compounds (phenols and terpenoids) in VOO obtained from two cultivars ("Arbequina" and "Picual") after fruits destoning. For this purpose, we used as reference the bioactive profile of VOOs obtained with intact fruits. A cultivar significant effect was found in the concentration of the main phenols included in the health claim of the Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012. Thus, fruit destoning contributed to significantly decrease the health benefits of VOO in "Arbequina" while no changes were observed in "Picual". These variations affected particularly to the aglycone isomers of oleuropein and ligstroside. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Comparison of droplet digital PCR vs real-time PCR for Yersinia enterocolitica detection in vegetables.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Yersiniosis-the 4th most commonly reported zoonosis in the European Union-is caused by the consumption of food contaminated with the bacterium Yersinia enterocolitica. The number of human cases and contaminated food samples is probably underestimated since conventional molecular methods currently proposed for Yersinia enterocolitica detection proved to have several limitations. Critical issues associated with the detection of Yersinia enterocolitica in meat and/or meat product has already been investigated, whereas data on the possible limits of the molecular methods for Yersinia enterocolitica detection in vegetables are still lacking. According to ISO method (ISO 18867:2015), real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtPCR) should be adopted for Yersinia enterocolitica detection, even if it proved to be affected by some biases. Recently, Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) has been introduced as a useful tool to detect and quantify different pathogenic bacteria in complex food matrices. However, its potential application for Yersinia enterocolitica detection in vegetables has never been investigated before. In the present study two molecular platforms (rtPCR and ddPCR) were used to evaluate the pathogen's behaviour in experimentally contaminated leafy greens (Lactuca sativa L.) and to assess the rate of detection achievable after the incubation for eleven days at different temperatures. By comparing, noticeable differences emerged between the two technical approaches: only ddPCR allowed the detection of the pathogen in leafy greens when contaminated at low levels. Moreover, results of the present work highlighted the importance of length and temperature of incubation on the survival and/or the growth of Yersinia enterocolitica in vegetables: at 18 and 25°C the concentration of the pathogen considerably decreases along incubation. Based on data, the use of rtPCR leads to an underestimation of the true prevalence of pathogenic Y. enterocolitica in vegetables, while temperature and time currently proposed for Y. enterocolitica (25°C for 24 h), allow optimizing detection. To conclude, ddPCR may be undoubtedly proposed as a reliable alternative strategy for the quick detection of the pathogen in food samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of the use of guabiroba bark and functional ingredients on the characteristics of Nile Tilapia burger.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of guabiroba bark (GB) on the techno-functional properties, chemical composition, lipid oxidation (thiobarbituric acid index [TBA]), microbiological, and sensory analyses of tilapia fish burger added with functional agents. Initially, the burgers were added with amaranth, chia and quinoa, and characterized with regard to cooking loss (CL%), reduction in diameter (RD%), reduction in thickness (RT%), cooking yield (CY%), color, pH, and water activity (Aw). The amaranth stood out (F02), generating values of 18.4% (CL), 7.7% (RD), 12.5% (RT), and 81.6% (CY). The addition of GB changed the lightness (L*), but did not affect the results for CL%, RD%, RT%, and CY%. The burger with (F05) or without (F02) the addition of GB showed no difference regarding protein and lipids. The BAGB showed lower concentration of TBA than the BA. The sensory analysis showed an average of 7.0 for all evaluated parameters. Practical applications. Nile tilapia is one of Brazil's most abundant fish species, but its consumption is still low and lipid oxidation is the main cause of loss in its quality and shortened shelf life. In addition, due to the highly competitive market, meat processors are constantly seeking for alternative solutions to meet the consumer needs for more natural, healthier products. Studies published in recent years show the use of natural antioxidants not only in the final product but also during the entire meat processing steps. A variety of natural antioxidants have been studied for this purpose. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Crofton, E.; Murray, N.; Botinestean, C.							Exploring the effects of immersive virtual reality environments on sensory perception of beef steaks and chocolate.		Foods					Virtual reality (VR) technology is emerging as a tool for simulating different eating environments to better understand consumer sensory response to food. This research explored the impact of different environmental contexts on participants' hedonic ratings of two different food products: beef steaks, and milk chocolate, using VR as the context-enhancing technology. Two separate studies were conducted. For beef, two different contextual conditions were compared: traditional sensory booths and a VR restaurant. For chocolate, data were generated under three different contextual conditions: traditional sensory booths, VR Irish countryside; VR busy city (Dublin, Ireland). All VR experiences were 360-degree video based. Consumer level of engagement in the different contextual settings was also investigated. The results showed that VR had a significant effect on participants' hedonic responses to the food products. Beef was rated significantly higher in terms of liking for all sensory attributes when consumed in the VR restaurant. While for chocolate, the VR countryside context generated significantly higher hedonic scores for flavour and overall liking in comparison to the sensory booth. Taken together, both studies demonstrate how specific contextual settings can impact participants' sensory response to food products, when compared to a traditional sensory laboratory condition. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Three important wine parameters: vineyard, region, and vintage year, were evaluated using fifteen Vitis vinifera L. "Pinot noir" wines derived from the same scion clone (Pinot noir 667). These wines were produced from two vintage years (2015 and 2016) and eight different regions along the Pacific Coast of the United States. We successfully improved the classification of the selected Pinot noir wines by combining an untargeted 1D 1H NMR analysis with a targeted peptide based differential sensing array. NMR spectroscopy was used to evaluate the chemical fingerprint of the wines, whereas the peptide-based sensing array is known to mimic the senses of taste, smell, and palate texture by characterizing the phenolic profile. Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses of the combined NMR and differential sensing array dataset classified the genetically identical Pinot noir wines on the basis of distinctive metabolic signatures associated with the region of growth, vineyard, and vintage year.

Study of the influence of pulsed electric field pre-treatment on quality parameters of sea bass during brine salting.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Pulsed electric field (PEF), as an emerging technique, has recently gained increased popularity in food processing and preservation. However, applications in the seafood industry are still scarce. In the present study, sea bass samples were subjected to PEF pre-treatment prior to brine salting to verify the possible acceleration of the brining rate, increasing the salt uptake and ensuring the homogeneous salt distribution in the muscle. The applied intensity of the current was set at 10 and 20 A (corresponding to a field strength of 0.3 and 0.6 kV/cm) prior to sea bass salting in brine with 5 and 10% salt concentration, respectively. The results have shown that PEF pretreatment could effectively shorten the brine salting time compared to control samples (from 5 to 2 days), or increase the salt uptake up to 77%, ensuring at the same time its homogenous distribution in the muscle. However, myofibrillar protein solubility was significantly reduced in PEF pretreated samples. At the same time, no significant differences in water holding capacity and water activity between PEF pre-treated and untreated samples were found during the whole salting period. Freezable water was influenced by PEF application, but the effect was significant only at the lowest salt concentration during the first period of the salting process. Industrial relevance PEF-assisted brining appears a promising technology in the fish processing industry due to its efficacy in reducing the salt brining time, increasing the mass transfer and enhancing the diffusion of brine into the muscle to ensure the homogeneous distribution of salt in it. The increased salt uptake of the PEF-treated samples compared to control samples shows future potentiality of using PEF prior to salting in the fish processing industry.

Viraemic pigs entering the food chain are the most likely source of hepatitis E virus (HEV) in pork meat: modelling the fate of HEV during slaughtering of pigs.		Food Control					Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) is an emerging foodborne pathogen and consumption of raw or undercooked pork products has been associated with increased risk of human infection. This work represents the first attempt to evaluate the risk of HEV being present on pig carcasses and in meat at the end of the slaughtering process considering the steps of bleeding, scalding, dehairing, singeing, polishing, evisceration and trimming. Based on available knowledge on the epidemiology and biology of HEV, the risk pathways leading to the presence of HEV on carcasses as a consequence of (i) faecal contamination of the skin from environment and contacts with contaminated faeces during transport and lairage, (ii) contact with viraemic blood at bleeding and (iii) faecal/bile cross-contamination during evisceration were assessed qualitatively. The pathway through which HEV could be present in meat of viraemic pigs, as conveyed by residual blood in muscular tissue after bleeding was instead modelled quantitatively. Of the three risk pathways evaluated qualitatively, only the occurrence of HEV on carcasses as a consequence of accidental rupture of the gut or gallbladder at evisceration was found to be non-negligible, but with a very low likelihood of occurrence. The quantitative output for the expected amount of HEV in meat of viraemic pigs shows minimum and maximum values of 0.10 and 1.1 * 104 genome copies (gc)/g respectively with 4.8 * 102 and 5.3 * 103 gc/g at 95th and 99th percentile of the cumulative distribution. These results are consistent with the existing evidence that levels of HEV RNA in meat samples are usually low even in the presence of high viral loads in livers of the same animals. Results of the sensitivity analysis confirm highly viraemic pigs entering the slaughter line as those posing the greater risk for consumers. Our study suggests that prevention of HEV infection through consumption of pork meat at pre-harvest/harvest stages should focus on reducing the flow of highly viraemic pigs into the food chain.

Modulation of the gut microbiota by probiotics and symbiotics is associated with changes in serum metabolite profile related to a decrease in inflammation and overall benefits to metabolic health: a double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial in women with obesity.		Food & Function					Modulation of the gut microbiota may help in treating obesity by improving host metabolic health. We aimed to evaluate the effects of probiotics or symbiotics on body weight and serum metabolite profile in women with obesity. A double-blind, parallel, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted with 32 adult women with body mass index ranging from 30 to 34.9 kg m-2. Volunteers followed a low-energy diet and were subjected to 8 weeks intervention: probiotic group (PG-Bifidobacterium lactis UBBLa-70, n = 10), symbiotic group (SG-Bifidobacterium lactis UBBLa-70 and fructooligosaccharide, n = 11), or control group (CG-placebo, n = 11). Analyses of anthropometric variables, gut microbiota and serum metabolites by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were performed at baseline and after the intervention. Multivariate statistics showed that all groups presented a decrease in glycerol and increase in arginine, glutamine and 2-oxoisovalerate. Therefore, a low-energy diet per se promoted changes in the metabolite profile related to decreased inflammation and positive effects on body weight. SG presented unique changes in metabolites (increase in pyruvate and alanine and decrease in citrate and BCAA). Negative correlations between arginine and glutamine with fat mass were observed in the SG. PG presented a decrease in 1H NMR lipid signals and negative correlation between Verrucomicrobia and Firmicutes with (CH2)n lipids. Both probiotics and symbiotics promoted changes in metabolites related to improved metabolic health. Specific metabolite changes following symbiotic intervention might suggest some advantage in providing Bifidobacterium lactis in combination with fructooligosaccharide in a low-energy diet, rather than probiotics or diet alone.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					In this paper, multilayer pectin-beeswax/colophony-pectin (P-BC-P) films including different proportions of beeswax/colophony mixtures were prepared in order to reduce the water vapor permeability. FTIR, XRD, DSC, polarized light microscopy (PLM), and water vapor permeation assays were performed. Characterization techniques showed (i) polar interactions between beeswax and colophony at the amorphous phase, (ii) changes in beeswax crystalline phase from sponge-like to needle-like structure, and (iii) formation of a eutectic mixture at BC3 70/30 ratio which guides the epitaxial crystallization of beeswax. Pure pectin films showed low resistance to the water vapor permeation (361*10-13 g m m-2 s-1 Pa-1), while multilayer films showed major control over the transport process. P-BC3-P showed one of the lowest water vapor permeability (WVP) values (56*10-13 g m m-2 s-1 Pa-1) and the closest WVP value to that of polyethylene films (LDPE 5.8*10-13 g m m-2 s-1 Pa-1). This result was attributed to the ordered crystalline structure reached by the epitaxial crystallization of beeswax within the hydrophobic phase. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Effect of pre-harvest inactivated yeast treatment on the anthocyanin content and quality of table grapes.		Food Chemistry					Due to the global warming, more and more often the red-pink grape varieties grown in the Mediterranean basin reveal an insufficient accumulation of anthocyanins and thus a scarce coloration. Nowadays, this is becoming an important technological issue, which may result in the reduction of the fresh market value of table grape. This study aimed at assessing the effect of the pre-harvest treatment by specific inactivated yeasts (YE) on the qualitative parameters and anthocyanin pattern of three red table grape varieties, which typically present poor and/or incomplete coloration during warm years. An increment of anthocyanins level up to almost seven folds corresponding to an improvement of red skin appearance was observed in all the treated table grapes, which was preserved after cold storage, too. While, no significant influence on chemical composition and berry texture and dimensions was found, meaning that YE did not cause appreciable taste changes in grapes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Developing functional fish pates from Oligosarcus robustus and Loricariichythys anus with pre- and pro-biotic potentials.		Food Bioscience					In addition to providing nourishment, functional foods have the potential to promote consumer health benefits. Novel fish (Oligosarcus robustus and Loricariichthys anus) pates containing prebiotic fructooligosaccharides and probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus LAFTI L10 were developed. Acidity and pH analyses were carried out right after the preparation of the pates (0 day) and on the 7th, 15th, 30th, and 45th days of refrigerated storage, while the other physicochemical and sensory analyses were performed on the 30th day of refrigerated storage. Finished products had high protein (above 11.0%), and low carbohydrate (0.18%) contents, considerable amounts of minerals (above 5.5%) and dietary fibers (10.0%), and a lipid profile with more than 83% unsaturated fatty acids, predominantly oleic (omega-9) and linoleic (omega-6) acids. Lactobacillus acidophilus counts were greater than 6 Log CFU g-1 for up to the 34th day of refrigerated storage. In addition, color, texture, and flavor attributes of both formulations received high acceptance and purchase intent scores, which suggest strong market potential.

A sodium alginate bilayer coating incorporated with green propolis extract as a powerful tool to extend Colossoma macropomum fillet shelf-life.		Food Chemistry					Fish deterioration imposes great economic losses and serious human health hazards. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of a sodium alginate bilayer coating incorporated to the green propolis extract in shelf-life, physical-chemical properties, microbiological properties and sensory acceptance of Colossoma macropomum fillets. Additionally, the chemical composition, along with the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Brazilian green propolis extract (GPE) were investigated. GPE showed promising antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Twenty-seven metabolites were identified by gas chromatography (GC-MS), which mainly comprised terpenoids (52.14%). Cyclolaudenol was the major constituent of the GPE and it is described for the first time in green propolis extracts. C. macropomum fillets treated with the sodium alginate bilayer coating showed high sensory acceptance, reduced microbial deterioration and extended shelf-life (up to 11 days) during cold storage. Taken together, these results show that GPE can be a great alternative of a natural preservative for fish coating. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Evaluation of the efficacy of probiotic VSL#3 and synbiotic VSL#3 and yacon-based product in reducing oxidative stress and intestinal permeability in mice induced to colorectal carcinogenesis.		Journal of Food Science					The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of probiotic VSL#3 isolated or associated with a yacon-based product (synbiotic) on oxidative stress modulation and intestinal permeability in an experimental model of colorectal carcinogenesis. Forty-five C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: control (standard diet AIN-93 M); probiotic (standard diet AIN-93 M and multispecies probiotic VSL#3, 2.25 * 109 CFU), and synbiotic (standard diet AIN-93 M with yacon-based product, 6% fructooligosaccharides and inulin, and probiotic VSL#3, 2.25 * 109 CFU). The experimental diets were provided for 13 weeks. The probiotic and the yacon-based product showed antioxidant activity, with the percentage of DPPH radical scavenging equal to 69.7 0.4% and 74.3 0.1%, respectively. These findings contributed to reduce hepatic oxidative stress: the control group showed higher concentration of malondialdehyde (1.8-fold, p = 0.007 and 1.5-fold, p = 0.035) and carbonylated protein (2-fold, p = 0.008 and 5.6-fold, p = 0.000) compared to the probiotic and synbiotic groups, respectively. Catalase enzyme activity increased 1.43-fold (p = 0.014) in synbiotic group. The crypt depth increased 1.2-fold and 1.4-fold with the use of probiotic and synbiotic, respectively, compared to the control diet (p = 0.000). These findings corroborate the reduction in intestinal permeability in the probiotic and synbiotic groups, as measured by the percentage of urinary lactulose excretion (CON: 0.93 0.62% * PRO: 0.44 0.05%, p = 0.048; and CON: 0.93 0.62% * SYN: 0.41 0.12%, p = 0.043). In conclusion, the probiotic and synbiotic showed antioxidant activity, which contributed to the reduction of oxidative stress markers. In addition, they protected the mucosa from damage caused by chemical carcinogen and reduced intestinal permeability. Practical Application. The relationship between intestinal health and the occurrence of various organic disorders has been demonstrated in many studies. The use of probiotics and prebiotics is currently one of the main targets for modulation of intestinal health. We demonstrated that the use of a commercial mix of probiotic bacteria (VSL#3) isolated or associated with a yacon-based prebiotic, rich in fructooligosaccharides and inulin, is able to reduce the oxidative stress and intestinal permeability in a colorectal carcinogenesis model. These compounds have great potential to be used as a food supplement, or as ingredients in the development of food products. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	4	1448	1462	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15690					FSTA:2021-08-Aj12118

Pinhao coat extract encapsulated in starch ultrafine fibers: thermal, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties and in vitro biological digestion.		Journal of Food Science					This study aimed to produce soluble potato starch ultrafine fibers for the encapsulation of pinhao coat extract (PCE), evaluating their relative crystallinity (RC), thermal stability, antioxidant activity, antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, as well as in vitro biological digestion. In the simulation of in vitro biological digestion, the phenolic compounds release profile was also evaluated. The ultrafine fibers were produced by electrospinning, based on a polymeric solution composed of soluble potato starch (50% w/v) and formic acid. Then, PCE was incorporated at various concentrations (0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5%, w/w, dry basis). The endothermic event of free PCE was not observed in the ultrafine fibers, which suggests its encapsulation. The RC decreased according to the increase in PCE concentration in the ultrafine fibers. The PCE resisted thermal treatments when encapsulated into the ultrafine fibers (100 and 180 °C), and the ultrafine fibers with 1% PCE presented the highest amount of preserved phenolic compounds. Regarding antioxidant activity, the free PCE presented 85% of DPPH inhibition and the ultrafine fibers had 18% inhibition, not differing among the PCE concentrations (p< 0.05). The free PCE and the ultrafine fibers with 0.5% PCE showed inhibitory effect against S. aureus and the ones with 1.5% PCE showed controlled release of phenolic compounds during the simulation of in vitro digestion. Starch ultrafine fibers showed potential to be applied in food industries due to their capacity of protecting phenolic compounds when submitted to high temperatures or gastrointestinal conditions. Nevertheless, their application depends on the end use of the product. Practical Application. The encapsulation of pinhao coat extract (PCE) in ultrafine starch fibers promotes greater preservation of phenolic compounds. Thus, it can be incorporated into different foods that are produced using the ultra-high temperature (UHT) process-at 135-145 °C for 5 to 10 s, or some other equivalent time/temperature combination. Another possibility is the incorporation of ultrafine fibers in active packaging: compounds can migrate to food, improving sensory characteristics, increasing shelf life, preventing chemical and microbiological deterioration, and ensuring food safety. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	7	2886	2897	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15779					FSTA:2021-11-Aj15771

Food Chemistry					The use of reference materials (RMs) is critical for validating and testing the accuracy of analytical protocols. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is in initial stages of developing a glyphosate in oats RM. The first aim of this study was to optimize and validate a robust method for the extraction and analysis of glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). The optimized method was used to screen thirteen commercially available oat products to identify candidate RMs. Glyphosate was detected in all samples, with the highest glyphosate mass fraction of 1100 ng/g; lower levels were measured in grains from organic agriculture. AMPA was quantified in nine samples up to 40 ng/g. The findings of this study led to the identification of candidate RMs, with "high" and "low" glyphosate levels. A preliminary stability study determined that glyphosate is stable in oat material at room temperature for six months.

Probiotic fermented milks: children's emotional responses using a product-specific emoji list.		Food Research International					This study aimed to develop and validate a product-specific emoji list and use this list to analyse children's emotional responses associated with the consumption of probiotic fermented milks prepared with different probiotic strains. Furthermore, the overall liking of the products was studied during a sensory test. Six formulations were studied: Bifidobacterium BB12 (BB), Lactobacillus acidophilus L3 (LA3), Lactobacillus acidophilus LA 05 (LA5), Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis (LL), Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 (LC), and Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (CONV). A total of 132 children (7-14 years old) participated in two study phases: development (n=32) and validation (n=100) of the list. Fifteen emoji were selected to be included in the product-specific list, which had a high frequency of citations in the first phase. The formulations with the highest overall liking (LL, BB, LC and CONV) were correlated with positive emoji, while the least-liked formulations (LA3 and LA5) were associated with negative emoji. Furthermore, the utilisation of emoji enabled the differentiation among formulations with similar overall liking. Therefore, this study developed and validated an emoji list to be used in the evaluation of fermented milks by children. The results suggest that the type of probiotic culture impacted the sensory characteristics of fermented milks, supporting the use of Bifidobacterium, L. lactis or L. casei in these products.

Efficacy of potentially probiotic fruit-derived Lactobacillus fermentum, L. paracasei and L. plantarum to remove aflatoxin M1 in vitro.		Toxins					This study evaluated the efficacy of potentially probiotic fruit-derived Lactobacillus isolates, namely, L. paracasei 108, L. plantarum 49, and L. fermentum 111, to remove aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) from a phosphate buffer solution (PBS; spiked with 0.15 g/mL AFM1). The efficacy of examined isolates (approximately 109 cfu/mL) as viable and non-viable cells (heat-killed; 100 °C, 1 h) to remove AFM1 was measured after 1 and 24 h at 37 °C. The recovery of AFM1 bound to bacterial cells after washing with PBS was also evaluated. Levels of AFM1 in PBS were measured with high-performance liquid chromatography. Viable and non-viable cells of all examined isolates were capable of removing AFM1 in PBS with removal percentage values in the range of 73.9-80.0% and 72.9-78.7%, respectively. Viable and non-viable cells of all examined Lactobacillus isolates had similar abilities to remove AFM1. Only L. paracasei 108 showed higher values of AFM1 removal after 24 h for both viable and non-viable cells. Percentage values of recovered AFM1 from viable and non-viable cells after washing were in the range of 13.4-60.6% and 10.9-47.9%, respectively. L. plantarum 49 showed the highest AFM1 retention capacity after washing. L. paracasei 108, L. plantarum 49, and L. fermentum 111 could have potential application to reduce AFM1 to safe levels in foods and feeds. The cell viability of examined isolates was not a pre-requisite for their capacity to remove and retain AFM1. © 2020 by the authors.

Nondestructive simultaneous prediction of internal browning disorder and quality attributes in "Rocha" pear (Pyrus communis L.) using VIS-NIR spectroscopy.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					This study explores the possibility of predicting the soluble solids content (SSC), firmness and the presence of internal browning disorders in "Rocha" pear (Pyrus communis L.) using a single VIS-NIR spectroscopic measurement in semi-transmittance mode. The spectroscopic measurement setup was developed to mimic real world conditions and takes into account geometry and technical requirements of a commercial fruit sorting optical module. The randomness of the fruit position during the spectra acquisition was simulated by sampling each fruit on four sides. Calibration models for internal quality properties were built using individual and/or average side spectra. The results show that models using the spectrum of each side as an individual sample only under-perform slightly relatively to the models based on spectra averages, which are common in the laboratory but very difficult to implement on an automated grading line. The performance of PLS, SVM and Ridge Regression models was compared for the prediction of SSC and firmness. Multiple types of spectra pre-processing were computed and the best combination of model and pre-processing method identified. The lowest RMSEP results for SSC and firmness were 0.7% (R2 = 0.71) and 7.66 N (R2 = 0.68) respectively, achieved using SVM on data pre-processed with Standard Normal Variate corrected 2nd derivative. For the internal disorder detection (browning), a classification benchmark composed by five different models (PLS-LDA, PCA-Logistic Regression, PCA-Extremely Randomized Trees, Extremely Randomized Trees and SVC) was implemented. PLS-LDA applied to the raw spectra presented the highest sensitivity, 76%. The results confirm that simultaneously achieving viable firmness and SSC predictions and internal disorder detection levels in pears is possible using a single VIS-NIR spectral measurement.

Extraction optimization of bioactive compounds from ora-pro-nobis (Pereskia aculeata Miller) leaves and their in vitro antioxidant and antihemolytic activities.		Food Chemistry					Ora-pro-nobis (Pereskia aculeata Miller) is a non-conventional food plant common in Brazil. The objective of this study was to optimize the extraction of bioactive phenolic compounds from ora-pro-nobis leaves by employing solvent mixtures. Ten extracts were obtained with water, ethanol, acetone, and their binary and ternary mixtures, evaluating the chemical composition, antioxidant activity and bioactivities in vitro. The response surface methodology was applied to model the results and calculate the optimal solvent composition, which is 60% water, 40% ethanol and 0% acetone. The optimized extract is rich in phenolic compounds (64 mg GAE/g) and proteins (823 mg/g) and presents antioxidant activity (in intracellular media as well) and inhibits lipid peroxidation (32%) along with hypotonic hemolysis (H50 = 0.339%), it does not present toxicity in vitro against cancer and normal cells. This is the first report of chicoric, caffeoyl-hexaric and coumaroyl-hexaric acids and some glycosylate derivatives of flavonols in ora-pro-nobis leaves. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Optimal thermoultrasound processing of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus lam.) nectar: physicochemical characteristics, antioxidant properties, microbial quality, and fatty acid profile comparison with pasteurized nectar.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The objective of this study was to determine the optimal thermoultrasound processing conditions for jackfruit nectar by applying response surface methodology and comparing the physicochemical parameters, antioxidant properties, microbiology, and fatty acid profile with pasteurized jackfruit nectar. Optimal condition was 80% of amplitude at 451 °C for 201 min, allowing physical stability of 68%, 60% of pectin methylesterase activity, ascorbic acid of 420 mg AA/L, total phenolic of 134 mg GAE/L, ABTS, DPPH, and chelating activity of 3,510 mol TE/L, 75 mol TE/L, and 96%, respectively. The thermoultrasonicated jackfruit nectar had lower microbial load and higher total soluble solids, ascorbic acid content, total phenolic content, antioxidant activity than pasteurized, and similar unsaturated fatty acids to the untreated sample. Our results demonstrated that thermoultrasound could be an option for processing jackfruit nectar as an alternative to pasteurization that allows successful inactivation of microorganisms, inactivation of enzymes, and good quality parameters. Practical applications. Based on consumer demand for more natural or fresh-like products, alternative technologies have been evaluated by research works looking to reduce the effects of heat treatments in the Food Industry. Among these technologies, thermoultrasound technology have gained relevance and seems to be a good replacement to inactivate microorganisms and enzymes without affecting the quality parameters, maintaining the unsaturated fatty acids content, and even increasing bioactive compounds. For example, the thermoultrasound application in jackfruit nectar has been demonstrated as a viable preservation technique to develop an innocuous nectar without affecting their food quality. Nevertheless, in order to solve the challenges about potential applications of ultrasound technology, further research is needed to obtain optimal processing conditions according to the food matrix quality required. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15029					FSTA:2021-05-Hq5279

Tomatoes consumed in-season prevent oxidative stress in Fischer 344 rats: impact of geographical origin.		Food & Function					Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) constitute an important source of health-promoting compounds including bioactive antioxidants, such as flavonoids, that can differ in terms of composition and quantity depending on the conditions that tomatoes are cultivated. Otherwise, biological rhythms modulate oxidative stress. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antioxidant properties of seasonally consumed tomatoes from two different geographical origins (local LT or non-local NLT) in Fischer 344 rats. The results show that LT and NLT have a specific phenolic signature and that each tomato gives a particular response toward biomarkers evaluated, which in turn showed a photoperiod-dependent effect. Remarkably, when tomatoes were administered in-season they improved or sustained antioxidant biomarkers, thus reducing oxidative stress values. It is noteworthy that the protective effect of tomatoes against oxidative stress depends on the geographical origin of the crop. Therefore, tomatoes consumed in-season may improve health by preventing oxidative stress. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Safety and efficacy of a beverage containing lupine protein hydrolysates on the immune, oxidative and lipid status in healthy subjects: an intervention study (the Lupine-1 Trial).		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. We have previously demonstrated the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of in vitro administered Lupinus angustifolius protein hydrolysates (LPHs) on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a beverage containing LPHs (LPHb) on the immune, oxidative and metabolic status of healthy subjects. Methods and Results. In this open-label intervention, 33 participants daily ingest a LPHb containing 1 g LPHs for 28 days. Biochemical parameters are assayed in fasting peripheral blood and urine samples before, during (14 days) and after LPHb ingestion. Participants' health status and the immune and antioxidant responses of PBMCs are also evaluated throughout the trial. The LPHb ingestion is safe and effective in both increasing the anti-/pro-inflammatory response of PBMCs and improving the cellular anti-oxidant capacity. LPHb also reduces the low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) /high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) atherogenic index. LPHb effect is particularly beneficial on decreasing not only the LDL-C/HDL-C index but also serum total cholesterol levels in the male cohort that shows the highest baseline levels of well-known cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion. This is the first study to show the pleiotropic actions of a lupine bioactive peptides-based functional food on key steps of atherosclerosis including inflammation, oxidative stress, and cholesterol metabolism. © 2021 The Authors.

Maltodextrin encapsulation improves thermal and pH stability of green tea extract catechins.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to trap green tea extract (GTE) with maltodextrin (MD) to protect catechins from high temperatures, pH variations, and storage. GTE: MD microparticles (19.35:80.65% wt/wt) were obtained by spray drying, producing microparticles (26 mum) with a trapping efficiency of 63%, containing epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), gallocatechin gallate, epigallocatechin (EGC), epicatechin, and catechin. The free GTE evaporated at 43 °C, loosed 50% of its weight at 100 °C, and decomposed at 130 °C. The microparticles started to weight loss at 75 °C and decomposed at 290 °C. The EGCG and EGC content of the free GTE completely depleted after 30 days at pH 7 and pH 6, respectively. However, the microparticles increased their EGCG content to 121% after 30 days at pH 7 and reduced 3.5% the EGC content after 30 days at pH 6. MD was an effective barrier capable of stabilizing the GTE's polyphenolic content and antioxidant capacity. Practical applications. The bioactive compounds of the green tea extracts (GTEs) are catechins with antioxidant activity; however, these compounds and their activity may decrease with the epimerization caused by high temperatures, pH variations, and storage. The immobilization of GTE in maltodextrin (MD) preserved its polyphenols' chemical structures and their antioxidant capacity at different pH and storage times; in addition, the MD immobilization offered thermal protection to the GTE. The results of our study allow us to advance the knowledge in the field, understanding the interactions between GTE components and MD molecules and the possibility of a commercial application of our study. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15729					FSTA:2022-01-Hn0112

Microbial diversity associated with spontaneous coffee bean fermentation process and specialty coffee production in northern Colombia.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Coffee fermentation involves the action of microorganisms, whose metabolism has a significant influence on the composition of the beans and, consequently, on the beverage's sensory characteristics. In this study, the microbial diversity during the wet fermentation of Coffea arabica L. in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta (SNSM) in Colombia was explored by high-throughput sequencing and the resulting cup quality through the standards of the Specialty Coffee Association. The taxonomic assignment of sequence reads showed a high microbial diversity comprised of 695 bacterial and 156 fungal genera. The microbial community was dominated by the Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) Leuconostoc, the yeast Kazachstania, and the Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) Acetobacter. Co-occurrence relationships suggested synergistic patterns between populations of LAB-AAB, yeasts-AAB, Leuconostoc-Prevotella, LAB-ABB-Selenomonas, and yeasts-fungi-nonLAB-nonAAB, which may result in the production of metabolites that positively impact the sensory attributes of coffee. The beverages produced were classified as specialty coffees, and their score was positively influenced by the fungal richness and the abundance of unclassified Lactobacillales, Pichia, and Pseudomonas. The findings show the richness and microbial diversity of the SNSM and serve as input for future research such as the analysis of microbial-derived metabolites and the establishment of starter cultures in coffee processing that guarantee the generation of high-quality beverages, the standardization of processes, the reduction of economic losses, and the production of value-added products that allow taking advantage of specialty coffee market.

Prebiotic potential and chemical characterization of the poly and oligosaccharides present in the mucilage of Opuntia ficus-indica and Opuntia joconostle.		Food Chemistry					The mucilage extracted from the convection-dried cladodes of O. ficus-indica and O. joconostle, two species of economic importance, delivered three fractions after methanol precipitation. Two were composed of high molar mass polysaccharides, and one included water-soluble mono-, di-, and oligosaccharides. The large polysaccharides have a molar mass range of 4.0 * 103 to 8.0 * 105 g. Mol-1 and are consistently composed of galactose, arabinose, xylose, and rhamnose; however, the content of galacturonic acid was different between both fractions and species. Their fermentability by selected probiotics was relatively low, 11-27% compared to glucose, and decreased with increasing levels of galacturonic acid in the molecules. In the third fraction, previously unreported oligosaccharides were found. These include simple-and complex-structured galactooligosaccharides with arabinosyl-, xylosyl-and galacturonosyl acid residues. Their fermentability by prebiotic species can be ascribed more to their structural characteristics and monosaccharide composition than their molecular dimensions. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Shelf life estimation and kinetic degradation modeling of chia seeds (Salvia hispanica) using principal component analysis based on NIR-hyperspectral imaging.		Food Control					A new methodology based on Near Infrared-hyperspectral imaging and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was developed and accurately validated to model the degradations kinetics and to estimate the multivariate accelerated shelf life (MASLT) of chia seeds (Salvia hispanica). Chia seeds were stored 180 days at 25, 35 and 45 °C, observing fatty acid degradation and an increase in the acidity. PC1 scores and kinetic charts were built fitting the time-related PC1 scores versus time by a fused kinetic model (R2> 0.85). The spectra of chia seeds where acidity increased at 75% from initial value were used to calculate the cut-off value (-0.9853). The shelf life estimations were 1300,798 and 90 days for chia seeds stored at 25, 35 and 45 °C, respectively. For the first time, a reliable methodology is proposed to validate that all samples were correctly predicted using PC1 scores. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Chromatograms are a valuable source of information about the chemical composition of the food being analyzed. Sometimes, this information is not explicit and appears in a hidden or not obvious way. Thus, the use of chemometric tools and data-mining methods to extract it is required. The fingerprint provided by a chromatogram offers the possibility to perform both identity and quality testing of foodstuffs. This perspective is aimed at providing an updated opinion of chromatographic fingerprinting methodology in the field of food authentication. Furthermore, the limitations, its absence in official analytical methods, and the future directions of this methodology are discussed.

J		Cubeddu, A.; Fava, P.; Pulvirenti, A.; Haghighi, H.; Licciardello, F.							Suitability assessment of PLA bottles for high-pressure processing of apple juice.		Foods					The aim of the present study is to assess the use of polylactic acid (PLA) bottles as an alternative to polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ones for high-pressure processing (HPP) of apple juice. The treatment of PLA bottles at 600 MPa for 3 min did not cause alterations in the packaging shape and content, confirming the suitability of PLA bottles to withstand HPP conditions as well as PET bottles. Quantification of total mesophilic bacterial and fungal load suggested HPP treatment can be effectively applied as an alternative to pasteurization for apple juice packed in PLA bottles since it guarantees microbial stability during at least 28 days of refrigerated storage. The headspace gas level did not change significantly during 28 days of refrigerated storage, irrespective of the bottle material. Color parameters (L*, a*, and b*) of the HPP-treated juice were similar to those of the fresh juice. Irrespective of the packaging type, the total color variation significantly changed during storage, showing an exponential increase in the first 14 days, followed by a steady state until the end of observations. Overall, PLA bottles proved to offer comparable performances to PET both in terms of mechanical resistance and quality maintenance. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cucciniello, R.; Forino, M.; Picariello, L.; Coppola, F.; Moio, L.; Gambuti, A.							How acetaldehyde reacts with low molecular weight phenolics in white and red wines.		European Food Research and Technology					Acetaldehyde is a key compound in determining wine color evolution and sensory properties. Major wine metabolites reactive to acetaldehyde are phenolic compounds, mainly flavan-3-ols and anthocyanins. Many studies have been conducted with the purpose of investigating acetaldehyde reactivity in model solutions, but very poor are the reports of its fate in real wines. By means of LC-HRESIMS and UV/Vis HPLC, red and white wines exposed to an excess of acetaldehyde were analyzed with a specific focus on low molecular weight phenolics. The chemical behavior of acetaldehyde turned out to be different in white and red wines. In white wines, it mainly mediated the formation of vinyl-flavan-3-ol derivatives, while in red wines it led to the formation of ethylidene-bridged red pigments. These latter positively enhanced the color properties of red wines. Conversely, in white wines, the formation of compounds, such as xanthylium ions, causing the undesired browning effects were not detected. © The Author(s) 2021.

Multi-element (13C, 2H and 34S) bulk and compound-specific stable isotope analysis for authentication of Allium species essential oils.		Food Control					Pure and natural essential oils of Allium species are primarily used in the food industry, but due to their low yield, production quantities can be difficult to achieve and thus can be highly expensive. Due to these problems, adulterations are a reality in this field. The purpose of this research is to develop a multi element stable isotope analysis methodology for authentication of the essential oils of leek, onion, shallot, and chive. Naturalness of these essential oils was achieved by assessment of compound specific delta13C and delta34S: an addition of 5% of synthetic compound can be detected. Chemometric models were undertaken to assess purity by distinction of the Allium samples according to their species origin using bulk stable and compound specific delta13C, delta2H, delta34S, and compositions of their major metabolites dipropyl disulfide, dipropyl trisulfide, methyl propyl disulfide, and methyl propyl trisulfide.

J		Cuciureanu, M.; Tuchilus, C.; Vartolomei, A.; Tamba, B. I.; Filip, L.							An immunoenzymatic method for the determination of ochratoxin A in biological liquids (colostrum and cow's milk).		Toxins					Ochratoxins are mycotoxins that have been extensively studied lately due to the multiple toxic effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and carcinogenicity. These toxins contaminate plant and animal foods and after ingestion they reach into body fluids. The method of competitive direct enzyme immunoassay, in the solid phase, was validated through the determination of specific parameters (performance, linearity, recovery percentage, limit of detection, limit of quantification). The validated method was used to determine ochratoxin A in colostrum and cow's milk. The method applied for the determination of ochratoxin A was linear for the concentration range of 0.0-0.5 ng/mL, the value for the regression coefficient (r) was 0.9838. Ochratoxin A was present in 91.67% of the colostrum and in 93.33% of cow's milk samples. The linearity of the method, demonstrated for very low concentrations of analyte, the detection limit as well as the limit of quantification recommend the method for the determinations of micro-pollutants from foods, including biological fluids. © 2021 by the authors.

Moringa oleifera leaves alleviated inflammation through downregulation of IL-2, IL-6, and TNF-alpha in a colitis-associated colorectal cancer model.		Food Research International					New chemopreventive alternatives are needed due to the rising worldwide incidence of colorectal cancer. The objective was to evaluate the chemopreventive activity of Moringa oleifera leaves (MO) in a colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis model. We hypothesized that MO contain bioactive compounds capable of modulating the expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response and carcinogenesis. Forty-eight male mice (CD-1) were divided into six groups; 1: Healthy control; 2: Positive control induced with azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/Kg body weight, intraperitoneal injection) and three cycles of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS, 1.5% in drinking water); groups 3, 4, and 5 were induced with AOM/DSS and supplemented with 5%, 10%, and 20% of MO, respectively; group 6: had no disease induction and supplemented with 20% of MO. Mice were treated for 12 weeks and euthanized. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were found for the moringa-administered groups in morphological and histopathological parameters compared to the AOM/DSS control. A decrease in myeloperoxidase activity (~50%) and lipid peroxidation (1.9-3.1 times) were found in groups with 10% and 20% of MO compared to the AOM/DSS control (p < 0.05). The group supplemented with 10% MO showed a significant increase (~3 times) in butyrate and propionate in fecal and cecal content. Groups supplemented with 10%, and 20% MO showed a reduction in proinflammatory cytokines in serum (MCP-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) compared to the AOM/DSS control. Treatment with 10% MO induced differential expression of 65 genes in colon tissue such as IL-2, IL-6, TNF, IL-1beta, and INF-gamma. MO downregulated proinflammatory mediators showing chemopreventive properties against inflammatory response and colon carcinogenesis.

Lactational performance, rumen fermentation, and enteric methane emission of dairy cows fed an amylase-enabled corn silage.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study investigated the effects of an amylase-enabled corn silage on lactational performance, enteric CH4 emission, and rumen fermentation of lactating dairy cows. Following a 2-wk covariate period, 48 Holstein cows were blocked based on parity, days in milk, milk yield (MY), and CH4 emission. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in an 8-wk randomized complete block design experiment: (1) control corn silage (CON) from an isogenic corn without alpha-amylase trait and (2) Enogen hybrid corn (Syngenta Seeds LLC) harvested as silage (ECS) containing a bacterial transgene expressing alpha-amylase (i.e., amylase-enabled) in the endosperm of the grain. The ECS and CON silages were included at 40% of the dietary dry matter (DM) and contained, on average, 43.3 and 41.8% DM and (% DM) 36.7 and 37.5% neutral detergent fiber, and 36.1 and 33.1% starch, respectively. Rumen samples were collected from a subset of 10 cows using the ororuminal sampling technique on wk 3 of the experimental period. Enteric CH4 emission was measured using the GreenFeed system (C-Lock Inc.). Dry matter intake (DMI) was similar between treatments. Compared with CON, MY (38.8 vs. 40.8 kg/d), feed efficiency (1.47 vs. 1.55 kg of MY/kg of DMI), and milk true protein (1.20 vs. 1.25 kg/d) and lactose yields (1.89 vs. 2.00 kg/d) were increased, whereas milk urea nitrogen (14.0 vs. 12.7 mg/dL) was decreased, with the ECS diet. No effect of treatment on energy-corrected MY (ECM) was observed, but a trend was detected for increased ECM feed efficiency (1.45 vs. 1.50 kg of ECM/kg of DMI) for cows fed ECS compared with CON-fed cows. Daily CH4 emission was not affected by treatment, but emission intensity was decreased with the ECS diet (11.1 vs. 10.3 g/kg of milk, CON and ECS, respectively); CH4 emission intensity on ECM basis was not different between treatments. Rumen fermentation, apart from a reduced molar proportion of butyrate in ECS-fed cows, was not affected by treatment. Apparent total-tract digestibility of nutrients and urinary and fecal nitrogen excretions, apart from a trend for increased DM digestibility by ECS-fed cows, were not affected by treatment. Overall, ECS inclusion at 40% of dietary DM increased milk, milk protein, and lactose yields and feed efficiency, and tended to increase ECM feed efficiency but had no effect on ECM yield in dairy cows. The increased MY with ECS led to a decrease in enteric CH4 emission intensity, compared with the control silage. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Occurrence and accumulation of human enteric viruses and phages in process water from the fresh produce industry.		Foods					The virological quality of process water (PW) used by the produce industry has received limited attention. As a first step to overcoming technical limitations in monitoring viruses in PW, the analytical performance of ultrafiltration was assessed to concentrate viral particles from 20 L of spiked PW. The selected method used for sample concentration of PW was carefully validated, thus enabling the accurate quantification and estimation of viral titers of human enteric viruses and phages. PW from the produce industry was collected periodically from the washing tanks of commercial facilities. The analysis of coliphages was performed by plaque assay, while the occurrence of enteric viruses and crAssphage was determined by molecular techniques. Significant differences in the physicochemical composition of PW, mostly due to the different nature of fresh produce types and differences in the sanitizer used in commercial operation, were observed. Accumulation of crAssphage and coliphages was observed in PW, but correlation with human enteric viruses was not possible due to the low prevalence of these pathogens in the PW analyzed. The obtained results showed that depending on the type of product washed, the product/water ratio and the residual concentrations of the sanitizers, the prevalence and concentration of bacteriophages changed significantly. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cufaoglu, G.; Ambarcioglu, P.; Ayaz, N. D.							Meta-analysis of the prevalence of Listeria spp. and antibiotic resistant L. monocytogenes isolates from foods in Turkey.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Due to its ability to survive in challenging conditions, Listeria species have been isolated in almost all kinds of foods. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of Listeria spp. and antibiotic-resistant L. monocytogenes isolates in all types of foods reported in Turkey using meta-analysis. Overall, 103 publications included to this study. The most frequently studied food types were chicken meat, ground beef, deli meat, ready-to-eat foods, cheese, and raw bovine milk, for which the pooled prevalence for L. monocytogenes were found 19.1% (95% CI:15.2%-23.7%), 13.9% (95% CI:9.7%-19.5%), 6.5% (95% CI:4.1%-10.2%), 5.2% (95% CI:3.4%-8.0%), 4.7% (95% CI:3.4%-6.5%), and 2% (95% CI:1.2%-3.1%), respectively. For the same food types the prevalence for Listeria spp. Were 62.3% (95% CI:55.2%-69%), 74.9% (95% CI:53.4%-88.6%), 16.8% (95% CI:10.7%-25.5%), 16.6% (95% CI:11.0%-24.3%), 11.0% (95% CI:7.1%-16.8%), and 5.6% (95% CI:3.5%-9%), respectively. For the most preferred antibiotics in listeriosis treatment the mean prevalence of penicillin, ampicillin and gentamicin resistance were found 30.4%, 27.2% and 8.3%, respectively. The rates differed among food types, however they showed that there is a potential risk in terms of public health. The results compiled herein contribute to the epidemiological surveillance of the presence and antibiotic resistance of L. monocytogenes from foods in Turkey. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cuhaci, A.; Karaat, F. E.; Ugur, Y.; Erdogan, S.; Asma, B. M.							Fruit quality and biochemical characteristics of new early ripening apricots of Turkey.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, the important fruit quality characteristics of 11 early ripening and promising apricot hybrids and reference cultivars recently developed in Turkey were analyzed. A large variation was observed between the genotypes in terms of fruit size (fruit weight ranged from 34.28 to 72.53 g). The total soluble solids which is one of the significant fruit quality parameters for the table apricots, was found between 10.07 and 18.27% and fruit flesh/kernel rate was between 9.6 and 18.42. Epicatechin, rutin, catechin, chlorogenic acid, epigallocatechin gallate and beta-carotene were found to be the highest bioactive compounds. A large variation was also determined among the genotypes in this regard. ABP-4-23 and ABP-7-12 apricot genotypes were rich with respect to catechin, chlorogenic acid, epicatechin, rutin and beta-carotene. The highest catachin and epicatechin contents were obtained in ABP-4-23 (176.76 and 517.45 mg/kg, respectively). In terms of beta-carotene ABP-2-24 and ABP-1-18 presented the highest values (127.45 and 119.54 mg/kg, respectively). Fruit weight was found highly and positively correlated with kernel weight and total soluble solids (r=0.65 and r=0.61, respectively). Fruit weight was also found to be moderately correlated with rutin, quercetin, and beta-carotene, while correlations was negative for rutin and beta-carotene.

Food & Function					Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an incurable chronic inflammation of the enteric tract. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of arabinogalactan from Lycium barbarum on DSS-induced chronic colitis. A homogeneous arabinogalactan was isolated and purified from L. barbarum, named LBP-3, which mainly consisted of arabinose and galactose with a molar ratio of 1.00:0.82. LBP-3 treatment remarkably alleviated body weight loss, histopathological damage and the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes in UC mice. Additionally, the intestinal barrier integrity was partially recovered by the up-regulated expression of MUC2 and tight junction proteins. Moreover, the gut microbiota shift was reversed by LBP-3 administration by enriching potential probiotic bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcaceae) and inhibiting the proliferation of harmful bacteria (e.g., Enterobacteriaceae). Furthermore, SCFAs, as major metabolites of LBP-3 fermentation by gut microbiota, were also promoted so as to maintain relatively favorable intestinal homeostasis. Overall, our findings suggested LBP-3 from L. barbarum could be a potential therapeutic candidate against UC via improving intestinal barrier function and partially restoring gut microbiota and its metabolites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	9829	9843	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01200b					FSTA:2022-02-Jf1630
J		Cui Han; Shuanglin Dong; Li Li; Qinfeng Gao							Efficacy of using stable isotopes coupled with chemometrics to differentiate the production method and geographical origin of farmed salmonids.		Food Chemistry					The delta2H and delta18O of 105 salmonids cultured in freshwater and seawater and from different regions were combined with linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) to create discrimination models. To assess the stability of the discrimination models, seasonal variation in delta2H and delta18O in salmonids cultured in different systems was studied. delta2H and delta18O were significantly different between salmonids cultured in freshwater and seawater and from different geographical origins. delta2H and delta18O of salmonids cultured in an open system were vulnerable to seasonal effects. The KNN model had 100% accuracy for identifying the production methods of salmonids and was less affected by seasonal variation. The RF model had the highest accuracy for identifying the geographical origins of salmonids with an accuracy of over 80%. Thus, delta2H and delta18O were more effective for identifying the production methods of salmonids than their geographical origins.

J		Cui Han; Li Li; Gong Zhang; Shuanglin Dong; Xiangli Tian							Assessment of elemental profiling combined with chemometrics for authenticating the geographical origins of Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei).		Food Control					Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is an important aquaculture species worldwide, and there is a growing concern over misdescribed shrimp products, particularly over their geographical origins. Shrimp samples were collected from 12 locations in northern and southern China to develop traceability methods in identifying their geographic origins. In one of the sampling sites, shrimp were collected from five farms using the same water source but feeding with different brands of feed to investigate the effect of feed on the elemental compositions of shrimp. Totally 35 elements (Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Th, Y, U, Li, Al, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Rb, Sr, Ag, Cd, Cs, Ba, and Pb) were detected in both shrimp and feed. Only Cd and Tb in shrimp were positively correlated with those in the feed. Moreover, 24 elements (Li, Al, V, Fe, As, Rb, Sr, Cd, Pb, Ce, Nd, Pr, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, Th, and Y) in shrimp were significantly different between northern and southern China. Elements As, Fe, Pb, Rb, Cs, and U, selected by stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA), were used to create a new dataset (SSDAs dataset) to compare with the entire dataset (ATEs dataset) in discrimination analyses. Classification tools, including linear discriminant analysis (LDA), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and random forest (RF) were used to create a discrimination model to authenticate shrimp provenance based on the ATEs and SSDAs datasets. The highest discrimination rate was achieved with RF using the SSDAs dataset, which achieved an overall correct discrimination rate of 100%, a cross-validation rate of 98.78%, and a predictive discrimination rate of 100%. Therefore, elemental profiling combined with chemometrics is a promising method which can be used to identify shrimp provenance.

J		Cui Han; Shuanglin Dong; Li Li; Qinfeng Gao; Yangen Zhou							Assessment of phospholipid fatty acid profiles for discrimination of salmonids cultured in freshwater and seawater.		Food Control					Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles were studied for their potential to discriminate between freshwater-cultured and seawater-cultured salmonids. The effects of culture season and fish size on the PLFAs compositions in salmonids were investigated to assess their effects on the discrimination results. Totally 19 PLFAs of salmonids were determined via gas chromatography (GC). Among them, 12 PLFAs were significantly different between freshwater-cultured and seawater-cultured salmonids. But only four PLFAs in salmonids cultured in different seasons and two PLFAs in fish with different size were significantly different. The PLFAs, including 18:1n9, 24:1n9, 20:5n3, 20:3n6, SigmaMUFA, and Sigman6PUFA, were selected via stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) for further multivariate statistics analysis. Principal component analysis (PCA) and canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) visualized the differences of the PLFAs profiles in fish cultured in freshwater and seawater. The linear discrimination analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF) were used to create a discrimination model that can authenticate salmonids farmed in freshwater and seawater. An overall correct classification rate of 95.89%, a cross-validation rate of 93.15%, and a predictive classification rate of 100% were achieved by the LDA. The RF achieved an overall correct classification rate of 95.89%, a cross-validation rate of 95.89%, and a predictive classification rate of 100%. These results indicate that PLFAs profiles can be used to effectively distinguish samples cultured in freshwater and seawater while less affected by season and fish size. Therefore, PLFAs analysis is a promising method for the accurate identification of salmonids cultured in freshwater and seawater.

J		Cui Li; Shuhui Song; Yanan He; Xindan Zhang; Haijie Liu							CaCl2-HCl electrolyzed water affects glucosinolate metabolism and improves the quality of broccoli sprouts.		Food Research International					This study evaluated the effects of CaCl2-HCl electrolyzed water (CHEW) with different calcium chloride concentrations on broccoli sprouts. CHEW treatment reduced the malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 contents of broccoli sprouts. The results showed that 10 kinds of glucosinolates were detected, and glucoraphanin was the dominant component. After hydrolysis, three kinds of isothiocyanates and two kinds of nitriles were detected in broccoli sprouts; however, the corresponding nitrile 4-isothiocyanato-1-butene was not detectable. The sulforaphane content of broccoli sprouts in the 10CHEW (Electrolyte of 10 mM CaCl2 acidic solution) treatment increased by 34.4%, and the content of sulforaphane nitrile decreased by 53.3% compared with that of the tap water treatment. CHEW changed the metabolism of glucosinolates in broccoli sprouts by promoting the synthesis of glucoraphanin, increasing the activity of myrosinase and decreasing the activity of epithiospecifier protein (ESP) for the generation of more bioactive isothiocyanates. In addition, compared to the tap water treatment, the calcium content in broccoli sprouts treated with 25CHEW (Electrolyte of 25 mM CaCl2 acidic solution) was dramatically enhanced from 15.8 to 49.7 mg/g DW. CHEW can be a useful tool for enhancing the amount of secondary metabolites and calcium content in broccoli sprouts intended for fresh consumption as a functional food.

Food Chemistry					In this study, the inclusion complex (IC) of thymol with 2-hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) was fast synthetized by ultrasonic technology and its antifungal activities were evaluated. The thymol/HPbetaCD-IC was characterized by UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, fluorescence emission spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, 1H-NMR, TGA and DSC. The phase solubility studies proved that the aqueous solubility of thymol was significantly improved by forming the inclusion complex with HPbetaCD, and the thermal stability analysis showed that thymol/HPbetaCD-IC had a better thermal stability than pure thymol. The in vitro antifungal activities of thymol/HPbetaCD-IC against Botrytis cinerea, Penicillium digitatum and Alternaria alternata were significantly improved compared with pure thymol. Furthermore, the gray mold rot of tomatoes was evidently inhibited by thymol/HPbetaCD-IC treatment in vivo study. Therefore, the complexation with HPbetaCD assisted by ultrasound is a promising approach to solubilize and stabilize thymol for application as an antifungal agent in fruit preservation.

Journal of Food Science					Red-fleshedapples are preferredbecause of their high content of phenolics and antioxidants in peel and pulp. Herein, we evaluated the mechanisms of apple peel polyphenolic extracts (APP) and apple flesh polyphenolic extracts (AFP) from the new red-fleshed apple in inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. The antiproliferative activities were determined by the CCK8 assay. The expression of proteins was determined using Western blot. We found that the content of polyphenols and flavonoids in APP was significantly higher than that in AFP, and 14 main phenolic compounds in APP and AFP were quantified using UPLC-MS/MS techniques. Besides, the significant inhibition effects of APP and AFP were achieved through Akt pathway by inducing apoptosis (significantly upregulating reactive oxygen species [ROS] levels, and downregulating expression of pAkt, pBad, Bcl-2, promoting Cytochrome c release, activating Cle-Caspase 9, and inducing expressions of Cle-Caspase 3 and Cle-PARP), and inducing G0/G1 cell cycle arrest (increased expressions of p-p53 and p21 and decreased expressions of PCNA and Cyclin D1). And the inhibition effect of APP was stronger than that of AFP. These results suggest that AFP and APP may be excellent sources of natural chemicals for treating triple-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. Practical Application. The effects of antiproliferation of phenolic extracts from red-fleshed apple peels and flesh on human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells were evaluated. The data may clarify the functional parts of red-fleshed apple and provide some basis for scientific researchers and consumers to recognize and exploit red-fleshed apple. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	9	4209	4222	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15863					FSTA:2022-01-Je0191

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is a natural dihydroflavonol with many bioactive effects. However, the physicochemical properties of DMY related to its bioavailability, especially its stability, are unclear. Results. The effects of pH, temperature, metal ions and ascorbic acid (AA) on the stability of DMY were studied using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The bioavailability of DMY in the presence and absence of AA was compared. Dihydromyricetin was unstable in weak alkaline solutions, and the degradation was significantly accelerated in the presence of Cu2+ and Fe3+. The degradation process followed the first-order kinetic model. The degradation rate constant (k) increased with increasing pH and temperature. The remaining DMY was only 49% of its initial concnentration after 4 h in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF) at 37 °C. However, by supplementing with AA, the degradation of DMY was rarely occured within 6 h. The solubility of DMY at pH 3-5 was about 750 mugmL-1, slightly increasing to 853 mugmL-1 at pH 6. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the bioavailability of DMY increased from 0.122% to 0.341% by supplementing with AA (10% of DMY). Conclusion. The degradation of DMY is one reason for its poor bioavailability. The presence of AA could significantly improve the stability of DMY, and further improve its bioavailability in rats. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3862	3869	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11022					FSTA:2021-10-Aj13938
J		Cuicui Duan; Lin Ma; Lin Cai; Xiaolei Li; Fumin Ma; Junliang Chen; Guicheng Huo; Dan Li							Comparison of allergenicity among cow, goat, and horse milks using a murine model of atopy.		Food & Function					Due to the prevalence and severity of cow milk (CM) allergy (CMA), an ideal substitute is urgently needed to develop hypoallergenic infant formula for infants who experience anaphylaxis to typical whey-based CM formula. Goat milk (GM) and horse milk (HM) are considered appropriate substitutes; however, whether GM and HM are less allergenic than CM is unclear. In the present study, the difference in allergenicity among CM, GM, and HM was investigated using the Balb/c mouse model. The number of mice with severe respiratory symptoms was significantly lower in the GM-and HM-sensitised groups than in the CM-sensitised group. Furthermore, histologic examination of intestinal and lung tissues revealed a thinner lamina propria of the small intestine and obvious inflammation and congestion in lungs in the CM-sensitised group than in the GM-and HM-sensitised groups. CM-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) E, serum IgG1, and plasma histamine levels were also higher in CM-sensitised mice than in GM-or HM-sensitised mice. In addition, higher interleukin (IL) 4 and IL-17A levels and lower interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IL-10 levels were observed in CM-sensitised mice compared with GM-and HM-sensitised mice, according to qPCR, indicating Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 imbalances. The CM-sensitised group had a higher proportion of IL-4-and IL-17A-producing CD3+ T cells but a lower proportion of IFN-gamma-and IL-10-producing CD3+ T cells compared with the GM-and HM-sensitised groups, confirming the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 imbalances. In conclusion, GM and HM were less allergenic than CM in mice as a result of a shift in the Th1/Th2 and Treg/Th17 imbalances; however, HM was less allergenic than GM and can be used as an alternative milk to develop infant formulas for children with CMA. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	12	5417	5428	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00492a					FSTA:2021-10-Pn5256

Foods					This work investigated the effect of lipase addition on a Chinese traditional fermented fish product, Suanzhayu. The accumulation of lactic acid and the decrease of pH during the fermentation were mainly caused by the metabolism of Lactobacillus. The addition of lipase had little effect on pH and the bacterial community structure but promoted the growth of Proteus. The addition of lipase promotes the formation of volatile compounds, especially aldehydes and esters. The formation of volatile compounds is mainly divided into three stages, and lipase had accelerated the fermentation process. Lactobacillus, Enterococcus and Proteus played an important role not only in inhibition of the growth of Escherichia-Shigella, but also in the formation of flavor. This study provides a rapid fermentation method for the Suanzhayu process. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					Zein is a widely used plant protein, but its application is limited by its poor water solubility under neutral conditions. In this work, we present an approach to develop a water-soluble zein-gum arabic (GA) complex and to explore its application in stabilizing lemon oil-in-water emulsions. As a simple, inexpensive and rapid method, sonication was used to accelerate the glycation reaction between zein and GA. The grafting degree of zein and GA was highest when the sonication power was 400 W and the treatment time was 25 min. SDS-PAGE and 1H NMR confirmed the formation of covalent bonds between zein and GA. The water-dispersibility, antioxidant activity, and thermal stability of zein-GA conjugates were better than those of native zein. The conjugates were used to form stable high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) containing 80% v/v oil, which had relatively small mean droplet diameter (<10 mum). The HIPEs were semi-solids that exhibited strong shear-thinning behavior. After encapsulation in the HIPEs, the chemical degradation of lemon oil when exposed to UV-light and heat was significantly reduced. This study shows that the functional performance of zein can be extended by covalently linking it to GA using a combination of sonication and heat.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Apple gray mold caused by Botrytis cinerea can reduce postharvest shelf-life and quality of apple produce, and thus causes serious economic losses. In this study, we investigated the biocontrol efficacy of Meyerozyma guilliermondii Y-1 with and without its combination with melatonin (MLT) against B. cinerea in the postharvest apple fruit, and the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms. Our results showed that the combination of M. guilliermondii Y-1 (1*108 cells/mL) and MLT (100mumol/L) synergistically and significantly reduced the decay incidence and lesion diameter. MLT improved the ability of strain Y-1 to colonize in apple fruit wounds and surface whether at 22 or 4°C. Moreover, M. guilliermondii Y-1 and MLT treatment markedly increased the defense-related enzyme activities, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO), as well as the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), total phenolics and lignin contents. As expected, the expression levels of four pathogenesis-related (PR) genes (MdPR1, MdPR5, MdGLU, and MdCHI) and two jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway related genes (MdPDF1.2 and MdCOI1) were significantly increased in response to strain Y-1 and MLT treatment. Furthermore, the most pronounced and/or rapid increase was observed in the combined than individual treatments of either strain Y-1 or MLT. Our results suggest that the effective combination of strain Y-1 and MLT might be a reliable alternative against B. cinerea postharvest infection in apple fruit.

J		Cuihua Chang; Yujie Su; Luping Gu; Junhua Li; Yanjun Yang							Microwave induced glycosylation of egg white protein:study on physicochemical properties and baking performance.		Food Hydrocolloids					The application of industrial egg white powder (EWP) was limited by the relatively poor foaming properties. Microwave treatment was proposed to be a creative and efficient technology to improve the functionality of EWP. This study focused on the physicochemical properties and baking performance of EWP undergoing microwave treatment at the presence of maltodextrin (MD). The solubility, fluorescent properties, molecular weight and secondary structure of protein were investigated to verify the glycation and structure transformation. The baking performance of the modified EWP was thoroughly investigated by foaming properties, specific volume, water content, microstructure, and sensory analysis. The microwave treated EWP at presence of MD showed smaller particle size and higher surface hydrophobicity than untreated EWP. The result of molecular weight distribution and FTIR spectrum verified the covalent binding of -OH abundant MD on the EWP molecule. The foaming ability of EWP after microwave treatment was increased from 4.84mL/g to 6.18mL/g at the presence of MD. The enhanced hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bonding between protein molecules were the main beneficial factors affecting foaming properties and baking performance of EWP. This study was meaningful for promoting the application of microwave-assisted glycosylation reaction in the functional modification of proteins.

J		Cuihua Chang; Yang Gao; Yujie Su; Luping Gu; Junhua Li; Yanjun Yang							Influence of chitosan on the emulsifying properties of egg yolk hydrolysates: study on creaming, thermal and oxidative stability.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Egg yolk, as a natural emulsifier, is widely used in high-oil-phase food systems, such as mayonnaise and salad. However, the application of egg yolk in an oil-in-water system is still limited due to poor emulsifying stability. To improve the emulsifying capacity of egg yolk, the effect of chitosan addition sequence and concentration on emulsifying properties (creaming stability, thermal tolerance and oxidation resistance) of egg yolk hydrolysates were investigated. Results. Stacking sequence of multilayer materials has an influence on properties of composite emulsions. The composite emulsions with egg yolk hydrolysis dominate at the interface (functioning on reducing interfacial tension), and chitosan layered on the surface (providing steric hindrance) displayed better stability. Little chitosan addition (0.5g*kg-1, w/w) was unhelpful for the dispersion of emulsion droplets as a result of bridging flocculation. At a chitosan concentration of 2gkg-1 (w/w), the composite emulsion possesses the best stability. When chitosan concentration was higher than 2gkg-1 (w/w), depletion flocculation would occur. Hydrolyzed egg yolk prepared composite emulsions possessed better thermal resistance, but with poorer oxidative stability as compared to natural egg yolk. In combination with chitosan it also displayed a negative effect on the oxidative stability of the emulsion system. Conclusion. The research revealed the effect of chitosan addition on the physical and chemical stability of emulsions prepared with egg yolk hydrolysates. The results could provide guidance on expanding the application of egg yolk as an emulsifier in water-abundant food systems such as beverages. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	11	4691	4698	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11114					FSTA:2021-10-Qc0727

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Lycopene is the main pigment in red-flesh citrus fruits, and its formation is a research hotspot. To explore the basis of lycopene accumulation in red-flesh mutants, we profiled the terpenoid metabolites. Compared with their respective wild types, Cara Cara (Cara) [and Red-Anliu (R-An)] oranges showed increased carotenoid and limonoid aglycone contents and decreased contents of abscisic acid (ABA) catabolites, monoterpenoid volatiles, and sesquiterpenoid volatiles. Cara contained less than half of the amount of ABA glucose ester (ABAGE), the main ABA derivative in oranges. Parallel lower transcript levels of NCED and ABA glucosyltransferase in Cara were detected at the mature green stage. These results document the changes in terpenoid profiles in Cara and show that the red flesh of citrus color mutants is related to weak ABA catabolism, especially ABAGE, and decreased transcript levels of two genes encoding uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferases that catalyze ABAGE biosynthesis.										2021	69	29	8236	8246	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03766					FSTA:2021-11-Jc15844
J		Cuiping Yi; Hong Zhu; Yu Zhang; Suxi Wu; Jinsong Bao							The role of indica starch in the mechanism of formation of fresh rice noodles.		Journal of Cereal Science					Starch is the largest component in frequently consumed fresh rice noodles (FRN). The effects of morphology, relative crystallinity, molecular weight distribution and physicochemical (rheological, water hydration and gel texture) properties of starch from five rice cultivars with different amylose contents on the formation of FRN were investigated. FRN made from NR rice cultivar, used for commercial rice noodles making, showed excellent FRN texture. NR starch exhibited larger G′ and smaller tan delta values. The morphology of FRN from GM03 cultivar was closest to NR, but had higher hardness and lower springiness, resilience and cohesiveness. Its starch granules morphology was relatively small and round. The extracted starch from Zhongzao 35, Zao 87 and BX02 rice cultivars, with higher swelling power or lower proportions of amylose (FrI) and higher proportions of amylopectin (FrII), could not produce a dense and consistent FRN structure. It was observed that relative crystallinity of the starch samples had no influence on the formation of FRN. Nevertheless, the gel texture of starch played a role in the formation of FRN. The formation of FRN is the common effect of structure and physicochemical properties of rice starch. The finding of this research would be useful in understanding the role of starch in producing FRN of high quality.

J		Cuiping Yi; Yisi Li; Hong Zhu; Yanlan Liu; Ke Quan							Effect of Lactobacillus plantarum fermentation on the volatile flavors of mung beans.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum on the volatile flavors of mung beans were studied using a gas chromatograph-ion mobility spectrometer, electronic nose, relative odor activity values and sensory evaluation. The main volatile compounds in unfermented mung beans were aldehydes such as nonanal, octanal and butanal, and esters such as ethyl hexanoate and ethyl acetate. The relative contents of the beany flavor components (1-octen-3-ol, hexanal and hexanol) were relatively high in the unfermented samples. The main volatile compounds of fermented mung beans (FMB) were acetic acid, ethyl hexanoate and ethyl acetate. The relative content of the beany flavor components in FMB decreased significantly, with hexanal changing the most. L. plantarum 23169 was most effective at removing the beany flavor. The electronic nose results showed that the flavor of L. plantarum 23169 FMB and L. plantarum 22699 FMB changed most and were similar, but the flavors from the three FMB samples could still be clearly distinguished. According to relative odor activity values, the special smell of FMB were fruity and grassy with no beany flavor, and sensory evaluation showed that L. plantarum YI-Y2013 provided a good "deodorization" effect, with the most obvious aromatic flavor and a high overall flavor coordination.

J		Cuiqin Fan; Ye Li; Tian Lan; Wenjing Wang; Xueqin Mao; Shu Yan Yu							Prophylactic treatment of curcumin in a rat model of depression by attenuating hippocampal synaptic loss.		Food & Function					Curcumin is a polyphenol substance considered to be effective in the treatment of a number of neurodegenerative diseases. However, details regarding the exact mechanisms for the protective effects of curcumin in neuropsychiatric disorders, like depression, remain unknown. In the pathogenesis of major depressive disorder (MDD) it appears that dysregulation of oxidative stress and immune systems, particularly within the hippocampal region, may play a critical role. Here, we show that pre-treatment with curcumin (40 mg kg-1) alleviates depression-like behaviors in a LPS-induced rat model of depression, effects which were accompanied with suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation and an inhibition of neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampal CA1 region, and results from ultramicrostructure electrophysiological experiments revealed that the curcumin pre-treatment significantly prevented excessive synaptic loss and enhanced synaptic functioning in this LPS-induced rat model. In addition, curcumin attenuated the increases in levels of miR-146a-5p and decreases in the expression of p-ERK signaling that would normally occur within CA1 regions of these depressed rats. Taken together, these results demonstrated that curcumin exerts neuroprotective and antidepressant activities by suppressing oxidative stress, neural inflammation and their related effects upon synaptic dysregulation. One of the mechanisms for these beneficial effects of curcumin appears to involve the miR-146a-5p/ERK signaling pathway within the hippocampal CA1 region. These findings not only elucidated some of the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective/antidepressant effects of curcumin, but also suggested a role of curcumin as a potential therapeutic strategy for depression. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	22	11202	11213	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02676c					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4167
J		Cuirong Ren; Qingzhe Jin; Jun Jin; Yanbing Zhang; Xingguo Wang							Characteristics of sow milks at different lactation stages and their frozen storage stabilities.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Characteristics of sow milk fats at different lactation stages, including colostrum (on day-1 of lactation) and milk (on day-15 of lactation), were systematically investigated from the emulsions, milk fat globules (MFGs) to fats. The viscosities of sow milks were significantly influenced by different lactation stages, in which colostrum showed a higher viscosity than milk. Colostrum fat globules had a lower volume-weighted average diameter (D43) (4.030.21 mum), surface-weighted average diameter (D32) (2.050.13 mum) and higher absolute zeta-potential (10.090.09 mV) than those of milk. The unsaturated ratios of MFGs in sow milk were reduced with the increasing size of the globules, resulting in that colostrum fat had a lower melting temperature of 30.260.98 °C with a corresponding lower starting crystallization temperature of 7.380.55 °C compared with milk fat. The general stability of sow milk during storage could be reflected from the moisture distributions: bound water showed an overall downward trend; while a downtrend of free water was found during frozen storage at-20 °C for 4 months. These results establish the foundations for the improvement and development of sow milk substitutes, as well as for the feasibility of being a substitute for human milk.

J		Cuixia Sun; Chenxi Wang; Zheqiang Xiong; Yapeng Fang							Properties of binary complexes of whey protein fibril and gum arabic and their functions of stabilizing emulsions and simulating mayonnaise.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Food protein fibrillization is recently regarded as an attractive strategy to broaden and improve food protein functionality in food science. In the present work, whey protein isolate (WPI) solutions was heated at pH 2.0 and 80 °C for different time (1, 2, 4,8, and 16 h) to prepare whey protein isolate fibrils (WPF), and the resulting WPF was mixed with gum arabic (GA) at pH 2.0-6.0 to explore the properties and functions of such mixtures. The fibril conversion rate of WPI continued to grow from 4% to 32% with the extension of heating time from 1 to 16 h. The phase behavior study showed that the insoluble WPF-GA binary complexes were formed at pH 4.6-6.0 due to the electrostatic interaction between amino groups of WPI and the carboxyl groups of GA. Compared to the WPI-GA complexes, the WPF-GA complexes had a higher GA content and coacervate yield, suggesting that the fibrillization contributes to the association of proteins with polysaccharides. WPF alone were linear, while fibril bundles appeared in the presence of GA. Such WPF-GA complexes exhibited an excellent capacity to prepare gel-like emulsions. The viscosity and strength of the prepared emulsions was gradually enhanced as the fibril conversion rate of WPI increased. Besides, the complexes of GA and WPF with a heat-treated time of 16 h showed the greatest potential to prepare mayonnaise analogues with a solid-like property, which possessed the similar storage modulus and smoothness to the commercial mayonnaise products.

J		Cuixia Sun; Xuelian Zhou; Zining Hu; Wei Lu; Yiguo Zhao; Yapeng Fang							Food and salt structure design for salt reducing.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Salt plays an important role in food processing and consumption. High salt intake increases the health risks especially the cardiovascular diseases. The growing demand of the consumer towards healthier foods serves as a driving force for the research and development of salt-reduced food products both by the academia and the industry. Since salt addition has a fundamental effect on the processing characteristics, sensory quality and shelf life of foods, the achievement of salt reduction is a great challenge. This article introduces the principles of salt reduction in food products, particularly from the view point of modifying salt and food structure. The size, morphology, and spatial structure of salt crystals were introduced. The relationship between salt reduction and structural characteristics of food matrix in baked foods, emulsion-based products and cheese products was discussed. Non-cubic and agglomerated salt crystals with a smaller particle size result in a greater saltiness perception. Salt with a hollow structure improves its availability to taste receptors, leading to the same desired taste at a lower salt content. Salt reduction is achieved through the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of salt in the food matrix. The multilayer structure in bread enhanced the saltiness perception intensity. Double emulsions due to the dissolved salt in both of the internal and external phases enhanced sensory perception of saltiness compared to a single emulsion. A looser and more porous microstructure of the cheese matrix facilitates the release of salt while a higher gel strength limits the release of salt in cheese.

Compositional changes in smoke-affected grape juice as a consequence of activated carbon treatment and the impact on phenolic compounds and smoke flavor in wine.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					An increase in bushfires and wildfires globally and consequent smoke exposure of grapevines has seen an elevated need for remediation options to manage the impact of smoke taint in the wine industry. Two commercially available activated carbons (PS1300 and CASPF) were evaluated at 1, 2, and 4 g/L with juice from smoke-affected Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes. PS1300 and CASPF treatments removed up to 75 and 92% of the phenolic glycosides in the smoke-affected Pinot Noir rose juice, respectively, and both carbons removed virtually all (i.e., 98-99%) of the phenolic glycosides in the smoke-affected Chardonnay juice at the highest dose rate (4 g/L). The free volatile phenols in the wines were similarly lower in concentration following treatment. Sensory analysis confirmed that the wines made from carbon fined juice had reduced smoke aroma and flavor compared to those from the nontreated controls. However, desirable sensory properties such as color and fruity attributes were also negatively affected by the treatment. The dose rate should be optimized in industry practice to find a balance between reducing the intensity of smoke-related sensory attributes while maintaining or enhancing positive attributes.

J		Culler, M. D.; Inchingolo, R.; McClements, D. J.; Decker, E. A.							Impact of polyunsaturated fatty acid dilution and antioxidant addition on lipid oxidation kinetics in oil/water emulsions.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					As consumers increasingly demand "cleaner" labels, one available strategy is diluting oils high in unsaturated fatty acids into more stable, more saturated oils, thus delaying lipid oxidation by decreasing free-radical propagation reactions between oxidized fatty acids and unsaturated lipids. The effect of diluting fish oil into medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) on oxidative stability was investigated using lipid hydroperoxides and gas chromatography headspace analysis. Dilutions up to 1 in 20 of fish oil in MCT extended propanal formation from 1 to 6 days in Tween-80-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions. This protective effect was not observed in emulsions wherein the two oils were in separate droplets. Fish oil blended with high oleic sunflower oil (HOSO) also demonstrated a protective effect when the oils were in the same emulsion droplets but not in separate emulsion droplets. The present study indicates that dilution can be used to increase the oxidative stability of polyunsaturated fatty acids in oil-in-water emulsions.

Effect of microencapsulated extract of pitaya (Hylocereus costaricensis) peel on oxidative quality parameters of refrigerated ground pork patties subjected to UV-C radiation.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effect of different levels of microencapsulated pitaya peel extracts (100 ppm-MPE100,1, 000 ppm-MPE1000, and 2,000 ppm-MPE2000) on the oxidative stability of refrigerated ground pork patties subjected to UV-C (0.5 J/cm2) for 10 days was investigated. Ground pitaya peel was microwave-assisted extracted utilizing different factors, and the extract with the highest polyphenol content (2.68 mg GAE/g sample) was microencapsulated and added to ground pork. MPE2000 promoted higher protection (30%) of polyunsaturated fatty acids. All extracts mitigated the increase of protein oxidation in an average value of 1.5 nmol carbonyl/mg protein; however, only MPE2000 hindered the lipid oxidation (about 44%) induced by UV-C up to sixth day. MPE2000 (Delta E=2.65) and BHT (Delta E=2.62) had an equal effect on preventing color changes. MPE2000 may be used as a simple and effective natural source to mitigate the adverse effects of UV-C on oxidative stability of ground pork patties. Novelty Impact Statement. Ultraviolet radiation type C (UV-C) is a nonthermal preservation technology useful for extending the shelf life of foods. However, in general, UV-C doses to promote antimicrobial effect induce lipid and protein oxidation, affecting meat color, which determines quality loss and consumer rejection. Due to the toxic effects associated with the consumption of synthetic antioxidants and the increasing demand for safe and healthy products, the meat industry seeks natural alternatives capable of maintaining the oxidative stability of meat during refrigerated storage. Our study could encourage the use of microencapsulated extracts of pitaya (Hylocereus spp.) peel in irradiated pork meat at an industrial scale. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Chemistry					Microbiota influenced quality formation of ripened Pu-erh tea. To understand the effect of each tea-derived fungal strain, tea-leaves were fermented by Aspergillus pallidofulvus PT-3 (ApaPT), Aspergillus sesamicola PT-4 (AsePT) and Penicillium manginii PT-5 (PmaPT), respectively. 14 Phenolic compounds, 3 purine alkaloids, 19 free amino acids and gamma-aminobutyric acid contents were determined by HPLC and amino acid analyzer analysis. Additionally, UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS method was developed for LC-MS metabolomics analysis. Multivariate statistical analyses, such as PCA and HCA, exhibited that the chemical profile of PmaPT fermentation was similar to biocidal treatment, but had significant differences with ApaPT and AsePT fermentation. The differentiated metabolites (VIP > 1, p < 0.05 and FC > 1.50 or < 0.66) and one-way ANOVA revealed the impact of three fungal strains in tea-leaves fermentation. APaPT and AsePT contributed to biosynthesis of gallic acid and several flavonoids, such as kaempferol, quercetin and myricetin in the metabolism of phenolic compounds.

J		Cunshan Zhou; Zezhi Wang; Xule Wang; Abu E. A. Yagoub; Haile Ma; Yanhui Sun; Xiaojie Yu							Effects of tri-frequency ultrasound-ethanol pretreatment combined with infrared convection drying on the quality properties and drying characteristics of scallion stalk.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Having short drying time and attractive product quality are important in fruit and vegetable dehydration processing. In this work, tri-frequency (20, 40 and 60kHz) ultrasound-ethanol pretreatment, ultrasound-water pretreatment and ethanol pretreatment were employed before infrared convection drying (ICD) of scallion stalks, which was aimed at improving the drying process and quality of the end products. The mass transfer, drying characteristics moisture ratio and drying rate and quality properties of scallion (rehydration, color, flavor, optical microscope image, moisture distribution and microbiological quality) were analyzed. Results. All pretreatments have decreased the drying time by 33.34-83.34% compared to the control, while ultrasound-ethanol pretreatment provided the highest time reduction (83.34%). The reason is that the volatility of ethanol have replaced air in the tissue, which produced a better osmotic dehydration effect and the cavitation effect of ultrasound changed the cell function of the material, so that the food tissue was rapidly compressed and expanded, resulting in damage to the cell structure. Ultrasonic-ethanol pretreatment has greatly reduced the water loss and dry matter of fresh scallion, improved the rehydration effect of dried scallion, better retained the color and flavor of scallion and effectively reduced the microbiological quality of the scallion. Conclusion. The tri-frequency ultrasound-ethanol pretreatment has effectively improved the drying process and quality characteristics of the dried scallion. Therefore, this research has a great contribution to the drying technology, as evident in the remarkable reduction in drying time and the improvement in the quality of the end product. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	7	2809	2817	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10910					FSTA:2021-08-Jq10161

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work aimed to study the rehydration characteristics of vacuum freeze-(VFD) and hot air-dried (HAD) garlic slices and explain the rehydration mechanism. It was observed that VFD samples had significantly faster water absorption rates than HAD samples. However, VFD samples had lower final moisture contents than the HAD samples. Additionally, the effect slice thickness on rehydration characteristics of samples was lower than that of drying methods. The contact angle and microstructure analysis of dried samples revealed that the strong water wettability and the porous structure contributed to the faster water absorption rate of VFD samples. Moreover, we found and confirmed, for the first time, that numerous air bubbles trapped in the VFD samples hindered the absorption of water. This resulted in a lower water holding capacity in VFD samples compared with HAD samples, which had less air bubbles.

Foods					Dysphagia that involves difficulty swallowing food and liquids is a symptom of different diseases. In some cases, patients who experience this symptom should be fed with modified consistency foods. Dysphagia is often accompanied by malnutrition and dehydration and an interesting approach to dealing with these conditions is to provide patients with nutrient-rich foods. In this study, two new food formulations for dysphagia patients are proposed: a cereal-based protein meal and a vegetable cream. The nutritional and rheological characteristics of the two innovative preparations were assessed and compared with those of commercial products. The proposed protein meal formulations meet the criteria for the "high protein" claim and the vegetable cream meets those of the "source of fiber" claim. The rheological investigation revealed that the flow properties of the innovative formulations were comparable to those of the commercial ones. Based on these preliminary outcomes, this investigation represents an interesting perspective potentially valuable to enlarge the offer of possibilities for people suffering from swallowing disorders. © 2021 by the authors.

Alessandro, C., d'						Protection of residual renal function and nutritional treatment: first step strategy for reduction of uremic toxins in end-stage kidney disease patients.		Toxins					The retention of uremic toxins and their pathological effects occurs in the advanced phases of chronic kidney disease (CKD), mainly in stage 5, when the implementation of conventional thrice-weekly hemodialysis is the prevalent and life-saving treatment. However, the start of hemodialysis is associated with both an acceleration of the loss of residual kidney function (RKF) and the shift to an increased intake of proteins, which are precursors of uremic toxins. In this phase, hemodialysis treatment is the only way to remove toxins from the body, but it can be largely inefficient in the case of high molecular weight and/or protein-bound molecules. Instead, even very low levels of RKF are crucial for uremic toxins excretion, which in most cases are protein-derived waste products generated by the intestinal microbiota. Protection of RKF can be obtained even in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) by a gradual and soft shift to kidney replacement therapy (KRT), for example by combining a once-a-week hemodialysis program with a low or very low-protein diet on the extra-dialysis days. This approach could represent a tailored strategy aimed at limiting the retention of both inorganic and organic toxins. In this paper, we discuss the combination of upstream (i.e., reduced production) and downstream (i.e., increased removal) strategies to reduce the concentration of uremic toxins in patients with ESKD during the transition phase from pure conservative management to full hemodialysis treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

Results. Showed that outcomes of micro-oxygenation strongly depend on aging treatments. High SO2 concentration during aging in barrels and bottles delayed typical phenolic changes and slightly contributed to astringency and lower color intensity, particularly in wine that was not micro-oxygenated. High metal concentrations and gelatin fining promoted intensive polymerization of proanthocyanins and a lower percentage of prodelphinidins after long-term aging in barrels. Also, flavan-3-ol and anthocyanins transformation rates in micro-oxygenated wines of both treatments significantly differed from their controls. Gelatin fining proved to be a very effective treatment for astringency reduction, particularly when combined with micro-oxygenation, but fined wines after long term aging in bottles showed lower color intensity.

Fast and green method to control frauds of geographical origin in traded cuttlefish using a portable infrared reflective instrument.		Foods					An appropriate seafood origin identification is essential for labelling regulation but also economic and ecological issues. Near infrared (NIRS) reflectance spectroscopy was employed to assess the origins of cuttlefish caught from five fishing FAO areas (Adriatic Sea, northeastern and eastern central Atlantic Oceans, and eastern Indian and western central Pacific Oceans). A total of 727 cuttlefishes of the family Sepiidae (Sepia officinalis and Sepiella inermis) were collected with a portable spectrophotometer (902-1680 nm) in a wholesale fish plant. NIR spectra were treated with standard normal variate, detrending, smoothing, and second derivative before performing chemometric approaches. The random forest feature selection procedure was executed to select the most significative wavelengths. The geographical origin classification models were constructed on the most informative bands, applying support vector machine (SVM) and K nearest neighbors algorithms (KNN). The SVM showed the best performance of geographical classification through the hold-out validation according to the overall accuracy (0.92), balanced accuracy (from 0.83 to 1.00), sensitivity (from 0.67 to 1.00), and specificity (from 0.88 to 1.00). Thus, being one of the first studies on cuttlefish traceability using NIRS, the results suggest that this represents a rapid, green, and non-destructive method to support on-site, practical inspection to authenticate geographical origin and to contrast fraudulent activities of cuttlefish mislabeled as local. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Curutchet, A.; Trias, J.; Tarrega, A.; Arcia, P.							Consumer response to cake with apple pomace as a sustainable source of fibre.		Foods					The use of apple pomace flour (APF) as a fibre enrichment strategy was investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate consumers' response to intrinsic and extrinsic properties of a bakery premix product when using APF. Apple pomace, a by-product from the juice industry, was dried and ground. APF is high in carbohydrates (47.47%) and fibre (38.48%), and it was used to partially substitute wheat flour and sugar in a cake premix. Acceptability, health, and nutrition questions were evaluated with and without information in terms of regular and fibre-enriched cake. The regular cake score was not affected by information, while the enriched cake's score increased with information. Three clusters were identified. Cluster 1 (29%) showed high liking scores for regular cake, cluster 2 (31%) for the fibre-enriched cake, and cluster 3 (40%) showed similar liking for both. Consumers described the samples and ideal cake using a check-all-that-apply (CATA) questionnaire. Penalty analyses explained differences in acceptability among consumers. Healthiness, tastiness, and fibre content were the main reasons to buy the enriched cake for cluster 2; taste for consumers in cluster 1; and healthiness and taste for consumers in cluster 3. APF as a functional ingredient may be a consumers' choice as a sustainable use of apple pomace. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Effect of blueberry (Vaccinium virgatum) extract on depressive-like behavior and metabolic serum alterations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged mice.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In the present study, we aimed to investigate the protective effect of blueberry extract on behavioral, biochemical, and morphological changes in an experimental model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced depressive behavior. Male Swiss mice were pretreated with the vehicle, fluoxetine (20 mg/kg), or Vaccinium virgatum extract (100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg) for seven days. On day 7, the animals were administered an LPS injection (0.83 mg/kg) or vehicle. Pretreatment with blueberry extract prevented LPS-induced depressive-like behavior. Moreover, LPS increased serum levels of total cholesterol; however, V. virgatum did not prevent the increase in total cholesterol levels. Furthermore, the extract prevented the LPS-induced elevation in serum reactive oxygen species. Also, V. virgatum extract increased the HDL cholesterol levels. Additionally, this extract prevented the LPS-induced decrease in glucose levels and serum adenosine deaminase activity. Collectively, V. virgatum extract has a potential protective effect against changes similar to those observed in patients with depression. Practical applications. Vaccinium virgatum, popularly known as blueberry, has been effective in preventing or treating neuropsychiatric diseases owing to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. Fluoxetine is a known drug used to treat depression; however, its adverse effects result in therapeutic non-adherence. Thus, the search for new natural compounds possessing antidepressant activities while lacking adverse effects is crucial for identifying novel therapeutic alternatives against depression. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		de Aguiar, Mayara Sandrielly Soares/ABA-5461-2021	Spanevello, Roselia/0000-0002-5117-2000; Lopez Alvez, Fernando/0000-0002-8905-8078							2021	45	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13920					FSTA:2022-01-Jf1077
J		Cuthill, H.; Elleman, C.; Curwen, T.; Wolf, B.							Colloidal particles for pickering emulsion stabilization prepared via antisolvent precipitation of lignin-rich cocoa shell extract.		Foods					This study concerns the preparation and functionality testing of a new class of Pickering particles for food emulsion stabilization: colloidal lignin-rich particles (CLRPs) derived from ethanol-soluble extract of cocoa shell. A further goal was to achieve Pickering functionality without the need to add co-emulsifying surfactants during emulsion processing. Cocoa shell is a co-product of the food manufacturing industry. As such it is anticipated that the particles would be accepted as a natural food ingredient, provided no harmful solvents are used in any step of their processing. The cocoa shell particles were milled, dispersed in water and exposed to 250 °C for 1 h in a stainless-steel tubular reactor followed by ethanol extraction to obtain a lignin-rich extract (46% (w/w) lignin with the remainder predominantly lipids). CLRPs were then fabricated by the precipitation of ethanol-dissolved extract into water (antisolvent). By employing an agitated process and droplet dosing into a non-agitated process, four particle suspensions of a range of submicron diameters were obtained. All particle suspensions contained the same mass fraction of extract and were surface active, with surface tension decreasing with increasing particle size. The smallest particles were obtained when lipids were removed from the extract prior to particle processing. In contrast to the other four particle suspensions, this one failed to stabilize a 10% (w/w) sunflower oil-in-water emulsion. We hypothesize that the phospholipids indigenously present in these CLRP formulations are a critical component for Pickering functionality. It can be concluded that we have successfully introduced a new class of Pickering particles, fabricated from an industry co-product and anticipated to be food grade. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cutignano, A.; Mamone, G.; Boscaino, F.; Ceriotti, A.; Maccaferri, M.; Picariello, G.							Monitoring changes of lipid composition in durum wheat during grain development.		Journal of Cereal Science					The lipid fraction of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum (Desf.) Husn.), cultivar Svevo, was characterized during grain maturation. Growing grain kernels were harvested at five key stages of development between 5 and 30 days post anthesis (dpa). Lipid evolution was assessed during kernel filling by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of triacylglycerols and methylated free fatty acids (FFA) as well as by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRESI-MS/MS) lipid analysis. Major triacylglycerols (TAG) were detected already at early developmental stages, albeit at low abundance. The decrease of FFA during kernel filling corresponded to accumulation of predominantly linoleate (C18:2n6)-containing C52 and C54 TAG. Fatty acid composition of polar lipids including phospholipids and galactolipids also showed the progressive dominance of linoleate, typically since two weeks after anthesis. Conversely, minor sphingolipids (ceramides and glycosylceramides) were constituted mainly by saturated long chain FA, also oxygenated, combined with a restricted set of sphingoid bases, and might play a signaling role during grain development.

J		Cutillo, S.; Farahnaky, A.; Marcotuli, I.; Gadaleta, A.; Sissons, M.							In vitro starch digestion and technological properties of spaghetti fortified with lupin protein isolate.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Spaghetti commonly made with durum wheat, typically lacks essential amino acids and with low fibre. Legumes offer potential to improve these properties and lupin is a good choice because it is cheaper with fewer antinutritional compounds than other legumes. Spaghetti was prepared with 0%, 5%, 17% and 30% lupin protein isolate (LPI) using both single-screw (SSEP) and twin-screw extrusion (TSEP). LPI increased protein up to 129%, reduced cooking time, water absorption and cooked firmness while stickiness and cooking loss were increased, especially using TSEP. LPI made the dried pasta more red and yellow and decreased brightness. The percentage of starch digested under in vitro conditions was reduced using 17%LPI with TSEP and 30%LPI with SSEP compared vs. control. Microscopy revealed changes in structure by LPI which may explain impacts on technological properties and digestion. Inclusion of LPI in pasta represents a potential approach for a low-cost improvement of nutritional value of spaghetti and potentially reducing its starch digestibility. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3567	3577	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14984					FSTA:2021-10-Mq6422

International Journal of Food Microbiology					The survival of Listeria monocytogenes was assessed during long-term storage on three dried fruits: dried apples, raisins and dried strawberries. Using sand as a carrier, the dried fruits were dry-inoculated with a four-strain cocktail of L. monocytogenes to achieve numbers of 4.0 to 4.6 log CFU/g. The inoculated foods were stored at 4 °C, 25-81% relative humidity (RH) and 23 °C, 30-35% RH for 336 days. Colonies of L. monocytogenes could not be recovered from the dried apples after inoculation, i.e., day 0. Concentrations of L. monocytogenes decreased rapidly on the raisins and dried strawberries during storage at 23 °C, with enhanced survival observed at 4 °C. Linear rates of decline for populations of L. monocytogenes during storage at 4 °C on the raisins and dried strawberries were 0.1 and 0.2 log CFU/g/month, respectively. The relative distribution of the four L. monocytogenes strains making up the cocktail was determined by multiplex PCR at the beginning of storage and after 336 days on the dried fruits. At day 0, L. monocytogenes populations were predominantly composed of the serotype 1/2a and 3a strains on both the raisins and dried strawberries. After long-term storage at 4 °C, a relative decrease in serotype 1/2a was observed on both fruits, coupled with relative increases in the serotype 3a strain during storage on both fruits, in addition to the serotype 1/2b strain on the raisins. These results demonstrate that L. monocytogenes is rapidly inactivated during storage on raisins and dried strawberries at 23 °C, but it is capable of long-term survival at 4 °C. Improved knowledge on the survival of L. monocytogenes on these commodities is important for predictive modeling and can be used to better inform microbial health risk assessments.

Evaluating the performance of lateral flow devices for total aflatoxins with special emphasis on their robustness under Sub-Saharan conditions.		Toxins					As aflatoxins are a global risk for humans and animals, testing methods for rapid on-site screening are increasingly needed alongside the standard analytical laboratory tools. In the presented study, lateral flow devices (LFDs) for rapid total aflatoxin screening were thoroughly investigated with respect to their matrix effects, cross-reactivity, their performance under harsh conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and their stability, as well as when compared with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). To analyze the matrix effects, qualitative test kits offering a certain cutoff level were used to screen different nut samples. In addition, these tests were challenged on their cross-reactivity with 230 fungal toxins and metabolites. Furthermore, the resulting measurements performed under harsh tropical conditions (up to 38.4°C and 91% relative humidity) in SSA, specifically Burkina Faso and Mozambique, were compared with the results from a well-established and validated LC-MS/MS-based reference method. The comparison of the on-site LFD results with the reference method showed a good agreement: 86.4% agreement, 11.8% non-agreement, and 1.8% invalid test results. To test the robustness of the cutoff tests, short-and long-term stability testing was carried out in Mozambique and Nigeria. For both experiments, no loss of test performance could be determined. Finally, a subset of African corn samples was shipped to Austria and analyzed under laboratory conditions using semiquantitative aflatoxin tests. A good correlation was found between the rapid strip tests and the LC-MS/MS reference method. Overall, the evaluated LFDs showed satisfying results regarding their cross-reactivity, matrix effects, stability, and robustness. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Pumpkin fruit (Cucurbita pepo L.) as a source of phytochemicals useful in food and pharmaceutical industries.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of the presented work was to evaluate polar and non-polar extracts and fatty oil, isolated from pumpkin fruit (Cucurbita pepo L.), as a potential food supplements or raw material for cosmetic and pharmaceutical preparations. The extracts were isolated from the pumpkin peel, mesocarp and pulp and fatty oil from the seeds. The highest yield of total extractive matter and highest beta-carotene content was determined in peel extracts at concentrations of 5.45 g/100gf.p.m and 136.22 mugg-1f.p.m, respectively. The presence of phenolic acids, flavonoids and carotenoids in polar and non-polar extracts was confirmed by UHPLC-DAD-ESI-MS and HPLC-DAD analysis, respectively. The yield of fatty oil in the seeds was 34.53%, while TLC and HPLC analysis showed the highest percentage of triglycerides (99.3%) and methyl esters (99.7%) in fatty oil and fatty acids methyl esters, respectively. Non-polar extracts of peel showed the highest antioxidant activity estimated by DPPH test (EC50 = 0.041 mgcm-3), fully comparable to activity of synthetic BHT antioxidant (EC50 = 0.021 mgcm-3). High linear correlation factor (0.9969) of EC50 values on beta-carotene concentration suggests that beta-carotene is the most responsible for significant antioxidant activity of non-polar extracts. Investigated isolates showed no antimicrobial activity against Lt. monocytogenes, St. aureus, E. coli, P. vulgaris, C. albicans, P. aeruginosa, B. cereus, K. pneumoniae and B. luteus under the examined conditions. Bearing in mind the results presented, the C. pepo isolates can be used as an alternative to synthetic antioxidants and a rich source of phytochemicals in food and pharmaceutical industry. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Composition and antioxidant properties of pigments of Mediterranean herbs and spices as affected by different extraction methods.		Foods					This study examined the composition and properties of chlorophyll and carotenoid extracted from the leaves of several Mediterranean evergreen shrubs and subshrubs (Myrtus communis L., Pistacia lentiscus L., Thymus vulgaris L., Salvia officinalis L. And Laurus nobilis L.) commonly used as herbs and spices. In order to fully assess their composition over a wide polarity range, pigments were extracted by successive solvent extraction with hexane, 80% acetone and 96% ethanol. Agitation-assisted extraction (AAE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) were employed and compared regarding their effect on the pigments' yield and composition. Individual chlorophylls and carotenoids were analyzed by HPLC-DAD, while the content of total pigments and the extracts' antioxidant capacity were determined spectrophotometrically. Throughout the experiments, pheophytin a, b and b were dominant chlorophyll molecules, while lutein and beta-carotene were dominant carotenoids. Overall, the extracted pigments were determined as being in the range of 73.84-127.60 mg 100 g-1 and were the lowest in T. Vulgaris, with no significant differences between other species. M. communis and P. lentiscus had the highest antioxidant capacities, showing a moderate positive correlation with carotenoid and chlorophyll levels. Significant differences were found in the levels of individual pigments with most of them showing a medium level of polarity due to the dissolution in acetone as a medium polar solvent. AAE and PLE demonstrated similar efficacy in the extraction of both carotenoids and chlorophylls; however, preference can be given to PLE, being a novel method with numerous advantages, e.g., shorter extraction time and lower solvent consumption. The examined plant species certainly expressed great diversity and showed the potential for application in the production of various functional products. © 2021 by the authors.

Improving rye bread antioxidant capacity by bread-making methodology: contribution of phosphate-buffered saline- and methanol-soluble phenolic phytochemicals with different molecular profiles.		Journal of Cereal Science					Bread antioxidant properties may be considerably modified in the bread-making process. To indicate the bread-making methods that may boost its antioxidant properties, five bread types were produced by straight dough and sourdough methods from seven rye cultivars. Their antioxidant, chemical and molecular characteristics were investigated in PBS and MeOH extracts. Free and conjugated phenolic acids (esters and glucosides) predominated in both extracts. Nevertheless, PBS-soluble fractions also comprised feruloylated arabinoxylans (69-83 mug/g and 28-29 mg/g of bread, for ferulic acid and arabinoxylan, respectively) with high molar masses (443000-556000 g/mol). They showed markedly higher concentration of Folin-Ciocalteu reactive components and two times higher ABTS+ scavenging capacity than MeOH-soluble ones. These parameters were significantly correlated with bread acidity and arabinoxylan-esterified ferulic acid content. Consequently, rye bread with the lowest pH, obtained by a straight method with lactic acid addition, exhibited substantially increased antioxidant capacity, owing to the most efficient hydrolysis of highly feruloylated water-unextractable arabinoxylans during bread-making. This study showed that macromolecule-bound ferulic acid present in physiologically relevant PBS extract of rye bread is a stronger antioxidant than much more abundant low molar mass phenolics extracted with MeOH. Thus, PBS extract might better reflect antioxidant potency of cereal-based products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

FODMAP intake in children with coeliac disease influences diet quality and health-related quality of life and has no impact on gastrointestinal symptoms.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Children with coeliac disease (CD) following the gluten-free diet may experience ongoing gastrointestinal symptoms despite strict adherence. The study objective was to evaluate the association between foods high in fermentable oligo/di/monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) and gastrointestinal symptoms, and the potential implications to diet quality and health-related quality of life in CD children. Dietary intake was studied in age-sex matched children 5-18years (CD, n=46; non-coeliac mild chronic gastrointestinal complaints [GIC], n=46; healthy controls [HC], n=46). CD children consumed fewer foods high in FODMAPs compared to GIC and HC (p<.0001). FODMAP intake was not related to gastrointestinal symptoms in CD children (p>0.05) but was positively associated with child health-related quality of life (p<0.05). FODMAP intake from fruits and vegetables was positively associated with diet adequacy and total diet quality in CD children (p<0.05). FODMAP intake may influence diet quality and health-related quality of life but has no impact on gastrointestinal symptoms in CD children. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to determine the changes in the baking value of rye flour and the content of nutrients in rye breadstuff under the influence of partial rye flour (RF) replacement with brewer's grains (BSG): barley (BBSG) and, barley with buckwheat (BBSG + B). Compared to rye flour (RF), BBSG and BBSG + B contained significantly more total protein, dietary fiber, lipids and ash, and less starch, which significantly modified contents of these ingredients in breadstuff with 10% of BSG in a mixture with RF. Under the influence of both supplements, the initial and final gelatinization temperature increased, and the measured viscosities of the gruel decreased, especially in the BBSG samples. The dough softening was reduced by replacing flour with BBSG + B, while increased by adding BBSG. The supplements increased the water absorption of the flour by 4-6%, which resulted in an increase in the bread productivity with their 10% share. The volume of breadstuff decreased significantly in the samples with 20% of BSG. In the organoleptic assessment, the breadstuffs with BBSG and BBSG+ B were rated higher than the rye breadstuff. Breads containing 10% of BBSG + B or BBSG were ranked the highest.

J		Czubinski, J.							Fluorescence polarization as an approach to study the molecular interaction between lupin seed gamma-conglutin and insulin.		Food Bioscience					Gamma-Conglutin is an unusual protein found lupin in seeds. Numerous scientific data indicate that this protein is capable of reducing glucose levels in the blood. Unfortunately, the molecular mechanisms underlying this unique feature remain poorly understood, mostly due to experimental obstacles. Interestingly, gamma-conglutin shows also insulin-binding ability, however, there is limited data about the kinetics of this interaction. Moreover, the available information comes from studies in which gamma-conglutin was immobilized or partially unfolded. Herein, the fluorescence polarization assay application allowed for a successful determination of the insulin-gamma-conglutin complex's binding parameters. Saturation and competitive binding experiments were done in a solution where gamma-conglutin and insulin retained their native structure. The dissociation (Kd) and inhibition (Ki) constant of the complex was 9.16*10-6 M and 7.34*10-6 M, respectively. It is expected that knowing the quantitative interaction parameters can help in explaining the gamma-conglutin hypoglycemic activity. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Czubinski, J.							Insight into thermally induced structural changes of lupin seed gamma-conglutin.		Food Chemistry					A multidimensional analysis aimed to determine the thermal impact on gamma-conglutin at the two oligomeric states was carried out. A wide range of biophysical and bioinformatic methods allowed to get insight into a thermal unfolding mechanism. The determined midpoint transition temperature (Tm) values were remarkably different, being 56.5 °C and 71.1 °C for gamma-conglutin monomer and hexamer, respectively. The unfolding pattern for hexamer molecules included aggregation/precipitation, while monomers tended to form soluble aggregates after heat exposure. Interestingly, differences in the aromatic amino acid residues movements indicate that during thermal treatment of gamma-conglutin hexamer red-shift occurred contrary to the monomer in the case of which blue-shift was noted. The obtained results provide an essential contribution to expand our knowledge about the molecular characterization of this intriguing lupin seed protein. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Czubinski, J.; Grygier, A.; Siger, A.							Lupinus mutabilis seed composition and its comparison with other lupin species.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Lupinus mutabilis, also termed Andean lupin, has gained increasing interest in recent years. In the literature, there is a lack of information about the detailed chemical characteristic of L. mutabilis seeds cultivated in the Europe region. Providing basic knowledge about the seeds' composition is essential for emerging their cultivation in Europe. The main nutrients present in the studied seeds were proteins and fat that constituted 44.7% d. M. And 15.4% d. M., respectively. Detailed analysis revealed that the proteins mainly consisted of alpha-and beta-conglutin fractions (>80% of all proteins isolated from the seeds). The main TAGs in the oil fraction were identified as LOO (16.43%), LnOP (14.72%), LLO (13.77%), and LnLP (10.17%). Other analyses revealed the presence of such pro-healthy compounds as oligosaccharides, tocochromanols, carotenoids, phytosterols, and flavonoids. The high content of proteins and fat that was determined in L. mutabilies seeds allows to consider them as a dual source of nutrients. Moreover, the wide range of bioactive compounds that were identified in the seeds suggests their application for the production of food with health-beneficial effects.

J		Czubinski, J.; Rusko, J.; Gornas, P.							Japanese quince seeds as a promising rich source of proteins and essential amino acids.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					The Japanese quince (Chaenomeles japonica) seeds (JQS) are generated in large amounts as a by-product in considerable quantities during industrial quince fruit processing. Due to economic, environmental, and nutritional reasons, the utilization of JQS as a protein source seems to be highly justified. Therefore, three cultivars were studied, "Rasa", "Rondo", and "Darius" of JQS as a protein source during three harvesting years. The total protein content in JQS determined by the Kjeldahl method amounted from 24.6 to 33.2% and was significantly affected (p ≤ 0.05) by the cultivar and harvesting year. The protein isolation was most effective in the pH range of 6-9, and their profile was mainly characterized by a molecular weight of 54.1-57.7 kDa and 70.0-77.6 kDa. The amino acids profile of JQS turned out to be valuable from a nutritional point of view due to the relatively high content of essential and relatively essential amino acids such as histidine (6-9%), leucine (11-12%), lysine (10-16%), phenylalanine (12-16%), glutamine/glutamic acid (7-15%), and tyrosine (9-13%). The initial analysis of JQS indicates that they can be a good source of proteins characterized by a favorable amino acid profile. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

R. d'						The addition of spices and herbs to vegetables in the National School Lunch Program increased vegetable intake at an urban, economically-underserved, and predominantly African-American high school.		Food Quality and Preference					Vegetable intake is far below recommendations among African-American adolescents living in economically-underserved urban areas. While the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) helps overcome access barriers, vegetable intake remains challenging and novel interventions are required. A two-year, multi-phase, school-based intervention was conducted at an urban, economically-underserved, and predominantly African-American high school in Baltimore, Maryland to determine whether stakeholder-informed addition of spices and herbs to NSLP vegetables would increase intake. The stakeholder engagement phase included assessment of NSLP vegetable attitudes/preferences among 43 school stakeholders and subsequent student sensory testing. The second phase was conducted in the school cafeteria and consisted of eight weeks comparing student intake of typical vegetable recipes versus otherwise-identical recipes with spices and herbs. 4570 student lunch plates were included in the vegetable intake comparison. Vegetable intake was measured by lunch tray plate waste. Willingness to try vegetables was assessed by the difference between plate waste and estimated mean vegetable served weight. Intake of typical vegetable recipes and vegetable recipes with spices and herbs was compared with student's t-test. Chi-square test was used to compare willingness to try vegetables. Total vegetable intake was 18.2% higher (8.22 g per meal, p < 0.0001) with spices and herbs than with typical recipes. There were no differences in trying vegetables with spices and herbs, although student-led advocacy was associated with increased trying vegetables with spices and herbs (78.8% with advocacy, 67.5% without advocacy, p < 0.0001). The addition of spices and herbs to vegetables in the NSLP was feasible and associated with small increases in vegetable intake at an urban, economically-underserved, and predominantly African-American high school.

Characterization of genetically modified microorganisms using short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing reveals contaminations of related origin in multiple commercial food enzyme products.		Foods					Despite their presence being unauthorized on the European market, contaminations with genetically modified (GM) microorganisms have repeatedly been reported in diverse commercial microbial fermentation produce types. Several of these contaminations are related to a GM Bacillus velezensis used to synthesize a food enzyme protease, for which genomic characterization remains currently incomplete, and it is unknown whether these contaminations have a common origin. In this study, GM B. velezensis isolates from multiple food enzyme products were characterized by short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing (WGS), demonstrating that they harbor a free recombinant pUB110-derived plasmid carrying antimicrobial resistance genes. Additionally, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and whole-genome based comparative analyses showed that the isolates likely originate from the same parental GM strain. This study highlights the added value of a hybrid WGS approach for accurate genomic characterization of GMM (e.g., genomic location of the transgenic construct), and of SNP-based phylogenomic analysis for source-tracking of GMM. © 2021 by the authors.

J		D'Alessandro, A. G.; Martemucci, G.; Faccia, M.	Alessandro, A. G. d'						Effects of microbial transglutaminase levels on donkey cheese production.		Journal of Dairy Research					Microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) is an enzyme widely used in the dairy sector to improve the functional properties of protein-based products via the formation of a network between protein molecules. The aim of this study involving cheese from the milk of donkeys was to evaluate the effects of treatment with MTGase at the concentrations of 0 (control), 5, 8 and 10 U/g milk protein on the cheese-making process parameters, as well as the physical and chemical characteristics of the resulting cheese. MTGase influenced the time of gel formation from rennet addition (P< 0.05), with a delay at the two highest concentrations, accompanied by a lower (P< 0.01) pH of cheese and the lowest (P< 0.01) loss in cheese weight at 24 h of storage. The highest gel viscosity (P< 0.01) was observed at the highest concentration of the enzyme, reaching the value of 70 mPa.sec after 60 min. The chemical composition and color of the cheeses were not significantly affected by the inclusion of MTGase, regardless of the enzyme concentration. These findings may be of relevance in adapting the cheese-making process and might help in the design of new dairy products from donkey's milk. Copyright ©The Author(s), 2021.

Journal of Functional Foods					The main aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of microencapsulation with soy milk as a carrier, conducted by spray-drying, on three mixed cultures of functional vaginal lactobacilli, Lactobacillus crispatus (BC1, BC3, and BC4) and Lactobacillus gasseri BC9, that could be further exploited as an adjunct in health foods. The i) physicochemical properties (using scanning electronic microscopy), ii) viability of encapsulated bacteria over time, and iii) functional features of powders containing the encapsulated bacteria were characterised considering different storage conditions. All microbial mixtures exhibited high viability for 90 d of storage, regardless of the storage conditions. All microencapsulated microbial combinations, excluding L. crispatus BC3 + L. gasseri BC9, exhibited hydrophobicity values exceeding 60%. Moreover, regardless of the considered combination, the in vitro digestion results exhibited a more significant decrease in cell viability for non-encapsulated microbial combinations than that of the encapsulated strains.

Food Research International					Sorghum is a potential substitute for corn/wheat in cereal-based extruded products. Despite agronomic advantages and its rich diversity of phenolic compounds, sorghum kafirins group together and form complex with tannins, leading to a low digestibility. Phenolic content/profile by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MSE and kafirins polymerization by SE-HPLC were evaluated in wholemeal sorghum extrudates; tannin-rich (#SC319) and tannin-free (#BRS330) genotypes with/without turmeric powder. Total phenolic, proantocyanidin and flavonoid contents were strongly correlated with antioxidant capacity (r > 0.9, p < 0.05). Extrusion increased free (+60%) and decreased bound phenolics (-40%) in #SC319, but reduced both (-40%; -90%, respectively) in #BRS330, which presented lower abundance after extrusion. Turmeric addition did not significantly impact antioxidant activity, phenolic content and profile and kafirins profile. Tannins presence/absence impacted phenolic profiles and polymerization of kafirins which appears related to the thermoplastic process. The extrusion improved proteins solubility and can positively enhance their digestibility (phenolic compounds-proteins interactions), making more accessible to proteolysis in sorghum extrudates.

Amore, T. d'						Going green in food analysis: a rapid and accurate method for the determination of sorbic acid and benzoic acid in foods by capillary ion chromatography with conductivity detection.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					An innovative analytical method for the simultaneous determination of two food preservatives, sorbic acid (SA) and benzoic acid (BA), by capillary ion chromatography with conductivity detection (CIC-CD), was developed. After optimization of a simple bain-marie alkaline extraction/purification procedure and chromatographic conditions, the method was validated with excellent results in terms of linearity (R2> 0.999), recovery values (ranging from 90.2% to 105.8%), limit of detection and quantification (1.6 and 4.1 mg kg-1 and 4.9 and 12.6 mg kg-1 for SA and BA, respectively) and precision (CV% lower than 3.9). The method was applied to all food and beverage types in which the additives may be added, according to European regulations, successfully. CIC-CD proved to be flexible, highly sensitive and selective, accurate and robust. Finally, embracing the main principles of Green Analytical Chemistry and the challenge of greening laboratory practices, the proposed method may be considered environmentally friendly, sustainable and "reagent-free".

J		D'Astous, A.; Labrecque, J.	Astous, A., d'						The impact of responsible food packaging perceptions on naturalness and healthiness inferences, and consumer buying intentions.		Foods					The research presented in this article examines the relationship between consumer perceptions that a food package is responsible (sustainable) and consumers' intention to purchase the product that it contains. On the basis of the relevant literature, a conceptual model is proposed where this relationship is hypothesized to be mediated by two variables: the product's perceived naturalness and healthiness. A first study was conducted with the objective of developing a scale with good psychometric properties to measure the perceived naturalness of a food product. The objective of the second study was to test the validity of the two-mediator conceptual model. The results show that the extent to which a food product package is seen as responsible (i.e., recyclable, reusable, compostable) has a positive and statistically significant impact on consumers' intention to buy it, and that it is through the sequential mediation of the product's perceived naturalness and healthiness that this relationship unfolds. © 2021 by the authors.

J		D'Costa, A. S.; Bordenave, N.							Inhibition of starch digestion by flavonoids: role of flavonoid-amylase binding kinetics.		Food Chemistry					In this study, kinetics of binding between alpha-amylase and green tea flavonoids were investigated by fluorescence quenching (FQ). Their effect on alpha-amylase inhibition was evaluated. Whereas epicatechin (EC) and epigallocatechin (EGC) exhibited slow binding kinetics (in the order of minutes), epicatechin gallate (ECG) and epigallocatechin gallate (ECGC) exhibited very rapid binding (in the order of seconds) with Human Salivary alpha-amylase (HSA) and Porcine Pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA). EGCG reached maximum inhibition of HSA and PPA with short incubation time whereas maximum inhibition of HSA and PPA by EC was reached only after 45 to 60 min of incubation. Similar results with ECG and EGC, but not in line with FQ kinetics, highlighted possible interferences of starch-flavonoid interaction in the binding and inhibition process. These results suggest that incubation times of enzymes and flavonoids shall be evaluated prior to enzyme inhibition testing in order to ensure consistent and reliable results.

Souza, K. d'						Whey peptides exacerbate body weight gain and perturb systemic glucose and tissue lipid metabolism in male high-fat fed mice.		Food & Function					Consumption of milk-derived whey proteins has been demonstrated to have insulin-sensitizing effects in mice and humans, in part through the generation of bioactive whey peptides. While whey peptides can prevent insulin resistance in vitro, it is unclear whether consumption of whey peptides can prevent obesity-induced metabolic dysfunction in vivo. We sought to determine whether whey peptides consumption can protect from high fat (HF) diet-induced obesity and dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed either a low or HF diet for 13 weeks. HF diet fed mice were provided drinking water with no addition (control), undigested whey protein isolate (WPI, 1 mg ml-1) or whey protein hydrolysate (WPH, 1 mg ml-1) throughout the diet regimen. Mice consuming WPH gained more body weight and were more glucose intolerant compared to those consuming WPI or water only. Despite increased body weight gain, perigonadal adipose tissue weight and lipid accumulation were unchanged. However, excess lipids accumulated ectopically in the liver and skeletal muscle in mice consuming WPH, which was associated with elevated inflammatory markers systemically and in adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle. In skeletal muscle, mitochondrial fat oxidation and electron transport chain proteins were decreased with WPH consumption, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Taken together, our results demonstrate that WPH, but not WPI, exacerbates HF-induced body weight gain and impairs glucose homeostasis, which is accompanied by increased inflammation, ectopic fat accumulation and mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus, our results argue against the use of dietary whey peptide supplementation as a preventative option against HF diet-induced metabolic dysfunction. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Journal of Functional Foods					Lactobacillus can effectively enhance the immune function of the body. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immunomodulatory effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 on cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced immunosuppressive mice. The results showed that CTX can successfully induce immunosuppression in mice. Compared with the CTX-induced immunosuppressed mice, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 alleviated the body weight loss of mice and increased the spleen index and the thymus index. Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 significantly increased splenic lymphocyte proliferation, phagocytosis of neutral red by macrophages, NK cell activity, the carbon particle clearance index, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) and serum half-hemolysis concentration (HC50) in immunosuppressed mice. In addition, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 could upregulate the serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-alpha and IgG, restore the damage to the small intestine and liver tissue in immunosuppressed mice. Taken together, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1.0320 can significantly enhance the immune function of immunosuppressed mice.

Foods					Doenjang and ganjang are secondary fermented soybean products from meju (primary fermented product) following a complex fermentation process that separates the products into solid (doenjang) and liquid (ganjang) states. We performed a comparative study on gas chromatography mass spectrometry-(GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry-(LC-MS) based metabolite profiling with fungal and bacterial microbial community analysis of doenjang and ganjang during fermentation. Metabolite profiling and microbial community data showed distinct patterns, depending on the fermentation process. The relative levels of metabolic patterns were similar and most of the microorganisms produced halophilic or halotolerant microbes during the fermentation period in doenjang and ganjang. In the doenjang end products, isoflavones, soyasaponins, and amino acids were largely distributed and Debaryomyces and Staphylococcus were dominant, whereas the biogenic amine and phenylpropanoid contents were highly distributed in the ganjang end products, with higher levels of Meyerozyma and Tetragenococcus. Our results demonstrate that the quality of doenjang and ganjang is predominantly influenced by the microbiome and by metabolite changes during fermentation. Moreover, the present study provides a platform for comparing samples in different states. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					For utilization of whole wheat (WW) in cooked rice products, WW was processed by four different methods (steeping (S_WW), milling (M_WW), enzymatic treatment (E_WW), and passing through a roll mill (1 mm) (R_WW)). Additionally, the physicochemical properties of cooked rice containing various processed wheat were investigated. The hardness of the cooked rice decreased significantly with R_WW and E_WW compared to WW. As a result of a consumer acceptance test, the cooked rice samples containing M_WW and E_WW with high liking scores frequently included "chewiness" as a reason for liking, and the cooked rice with WW and S_WW was mentioned as being "too hard" as a reason for disliking. The cooked rice with R_WW, which had the lowest liking score, was mentioned as having appearance characteristics such as "husk", "clumpy appearance", and "messy appearance" as reasons for disliking. The overall results of this study suggest the inclusion of M_WW or E_WW with cooked rice considering health-related benefits and consumer acceptability. © 2021 by the authors.

Bw during 90 days feeding administration; there was no significant difference in bw and food consumption; no significant differences were found in each hematology and serum biochemistry parameter and organ/body weight ratio comparing with the control experimental group. The results revealed that the FSLT has low or no toxicity via oral administration. Therefore, FSLT is very suitable and safe to be used as a new resource food. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	2	305	314	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-020-00855-y					FSTA:2021-06-Hn6204

European Food Research and Technology					The objective was to screen Lactobacillus strains with strong survivability in oro-gastrointestinal tract and adhesion abilities of intestinal mucins and Caco-2 cells, and their effect on absorption of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) by epithelial cells was studied. The survival rate of Lactobacillus strains was studied after exposure to oral stress, gastric stress and intestinal stress successively, and then their adhesion ability was also researched. The model of intestinal epithelial cells absorbing SCFAs was established, which was used to evaluate the effect of Lactobacillus strains on Caco-2 cells absorption of SCFAs. The survival rate of Lactobacillus plantarum L58, L67, L97, L123, and L198 and Lactobacillus fermentum L146 was significantly higher than others in oro-gastrointestinal tract (P< 0.05), which also showed high adhesion to mucins and Caco-2 cells. The model was successfully established with the Caco-2 cell line, which formed a polarized cell monolayer and developed tight junctions with an appropriate permeability coefficient for phenol red lower than 1 * 10-6 cm/s after culturing for 15 days, and the viability of Caco-2 cells was significantly higher than other concentrations when the content of propionic acid or butyric acid was 1 mmol/L in the model. The propionic acid content in Caco-2 cells inoculated with L. plantarum L58, L67, L97, L123, and L198 was significantly higher than that of cells without L. plantarum inoculation (P< 0.05), and the butyric acid content in cells inoculated with L. fermentum L146 was significantly higher than that of cells without inoculation (P< 0.05). Our results highlight that L. plantarum L58, L67, L97, L123, L198 and L. fermentum L146 are more resistant to oro-gastrointestinal conditions and their high adhesion to the intestine can enhance SCFAs uptake in intestinal epithelial cells. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	5	1049	1060	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03686-1					FSTA:2021-08-Ad11863

Food & Function					To maximize the biological activity of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), it is necessary to find a new excipient agent to increase the bioavailability of BCAAs in protein mixtures. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of soy lecithin (SLC), zinc oxide (ZnO), and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) on the bioaccessibility and intestinal transport of BCAAs from animal and plant protein mixtures (PMs) via an in vitro digestion model with human intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. The bioaccessibility of total BCAAs in PMs considerably increased by 107.511.50% with the addition of SLC, and the combined effects of SLC, ZnO, and MSM on enhancing the bioaccessibility of total BCAAs was observed (107.140.18%). Interestingly, SLC showed a major role in binding bile acid, showing 65.781.66% of binding capacity. Intestinal transport of BCAAs was measured to be at 100.48,110.86, and 130.29 mug mL-1 for leucine, isoleucine, and valine, respectively, in PMs with SLC+ ZnO+ MSM, and it eventually amplified the amount of the total transported BCAAs (341.636.34 mug mL-1), which was about 8.72 times higher than that of PM only. The cellular integrity of digesta-treated Caco-2 cells tended to decrease according to the incubation time, but it was recovered in the treatment of PM+ SLC+ ZnO+ MSM, and nearly reached the control levels with 92.820.53%. Results. From the current study suggest that the co-consumption of proteins equally consisting of plant and animal sources with SLC, ZnO, and MSM could improve the bioavailability of total BCAAs, resulting in the improvement of health benefits. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	22	11399	11407	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01712h					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4160

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The aim of the current study is to investigate the effects of spray dry powders of Curcuma longa containing 40% curcumin (CM-SD), as a new aqueous curcumin formula, on sarcopenia in chronic forced exercise executed 10 month old ICR mice. CM-SD (80 and 40 mg/kg) increased calf thicknesses and strengths, total body and calf protein amounts, and muscle weights in both gastrocnemius and soleus muscles. MRNA expressions regarding muscle growth and protein synthesis were induced, while those of muscle degradation significantly declined in CM-SD treatment. CM-SD decreased serum biochemical markers, lipid peroxidation, and reactive oxygen species and increased endogenous antioxidants and enzyme activities. It also reduced immunoreactive myofibers for apoptosis and oxidative stress markers but increased ATPase in myofibers. These results suggest that CM-SD can be an adjunct therapy to exercise-based remedy that prevents muscle disorders including sarcopenia by anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation, and antioxidation-mediated modulation of gene expressions related to muscle degradation and protein synthesis.										2021	69	22	6214	6228	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00699					FSTA:2021-10-Te3890
J		Da-Young Jee; Jae-Won Ha							Synergistic interaction of tap water-based neutral electrolyzed water combined with UVA irradiation to enhance microbial inactivation on stainless steel.		Food Research International					As an emerging electrolyzed water (EW) technology, tap water-based neutral electrolyzed water (TNEW) is an attractive alternative to other types of conventional EW for sterilization of food contact surfaces. In this study, we sought to identify strategies for improving TNEW inactivation efficiencies of major foodborne pathogenic bacteria. We investigated the synergistic antimicrobial effect of TNEW and ultraviolet-A light (UVA) combination treatment against Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella Typhimurium, and Listeria monocytogenes on stainless steel. The data confirmed that simultaneous TNEW and UVA treatment for 60 min reduced E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes population by 2.15, 1.55, and 2.65 log CFU/cm2, respectively. The synergistic cell count reductions in E. coli O157:H7, S. Typhimurium, and L. monocytogenes in the combination treatment group were 1.17, 0.59, and 1.62 log units, respectively. Additionally, the mechanisms of the synergistic bactericidal effects of TNEW and UVA were identified through several approaches. Mechanistic investigations suggested that the synergistic effect was associated with intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, bacterial cell membrane damage, and inactivation of dehydrogenase. These findings demonstrate that treatment with TNEW and UVA light can enhance the microbiological safety of food contact surfaces during food processing.

The concentration of free amino acids (FAAs) and groups of microorganisms associated with the food products were in parallel analysed to correlate the presence of precursor FAA and microbiological activity to the formation of BAs during the production process of the foodstuffs or during the storage and distribution of the food products. Profiles of BAs differed greatly between the groups of foods. Except for tryptamine, significant positive correlations were found between the BA concentrations and corresponding precursor FAAs. Correlations between microbial counts and BAs concentrations were stronger in the group of meat-based products than in other groups of foods tested. The study provides a basis for the assessment of potential public health impact of BAs, which is nowadays restricted to histamine in scombroid fish species and their derived products.

J		Dabbour, M.; Hui Jiang; Mintah, B. K.; Hafida Wahia; Ronghai He							Ultrasonic-assisted protein extraction from sunflower meal: kinetic modeling, functional, and structural traits.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Effect of mono and dual frequency (20, 28 and 20/28 kHz) ultrasound action on extraction kinetics, functional, and structural traits of sunflower protein (SP) was examined. A simplified model based on Fick's second law was developed, and the mass transfer of soluble SP in a heterogeneous system was successfully described. Findings suggested that ultrasound action significantly increased (p< 0.05) the release and diffusion of soluble SP across the cell wall into extraction solvent, causing enhanced observed rate constant (k) and diffusion-effective coefficient (Ds) values over control. Moreover, dual frequency sonication (20/28 kHz) considerably increased oil holding efficacy and surface charge (by 21.07 and 32.15%, respectively), but reduced water holding efficacy and particle size (by 40.74 and 26.61%, respectively) relative to untreated sample (p< 0.05). Also, ultrasonicated SP displayed excellent solubility under varying pH (2-10), likened to the control (p < 0.05). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) outcomes indicated that ultrasonicated SP showed irregular fragments, heterogenous/ disordered structure and small-sized particles, suggesting that sonication (notably 20/28 kHz) destroyed the cross-linkages among SP molecules. FT-IR spectroscopy exhibited that ultrasonication improved the content of beta-sheet from 8.52-18.94% and random coil from 11.63-21.71%, whereas reductions in alpha-helix and beta-turn were noticed, implying limited unfolding of SP structure and decreases in intermolecular interactions. Intrinsic fluorescence analysis revealed that dual frequency treatment was observed to be more efficient in altering the tertiary structure of SP reference to single frequency and control. Industrial relevance Sunflower protein, isolated from sunflower residue, is a potentially low-cost resource for food applications. Ultrasonication is reported to improve the extraction of proteins as well as enhancing their functionalities. The existing study displayed that ultrasonication (observably dual frequency treated) was successfully applied to improve the extractability of soluble sunflower protein, and enhanced its functionality (solubility and OHe) reference to control.

Q.; Minsun Kim; Jungju Seo; Kyoung-Soon Jang; Jeongkwon Kim							MALDI-MS analysis of disaccharide isomers using graphene oxide as MALDI matrix.		Food Chemistry					Disaccharides are sugars composed of two monosaccharides joined by a glycosidic linkage. The specific properties of a disaccharide depend on the type of the glycosidic linkage and the identity of the two component monosaccharides. In this work, seven disaccharide isomers (gentiobiose, isomaltose, melibiose, lactose, maltose, cellobiose, and sucrose) were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) using a graphene oxide matrix. Each disaccharide was identified by its unique cleavage pattern. To determine the feasibility of quantitative analyses based on specific fragment patterns, mixtures of sucrose with cellobiose or maltose were prepared at different ratios and analyzed by MALDI-MS, where a strong linear correlation was observed between the relative peak intensity of the sucrose fragment peak at m/z 185 and the amount of sucrose in the mixture. The calibration curve was successfully applied to obtain the relative amount of maltose and sucrose in four different honey samples.

J		Dach, A.; Schieberle, P.							Characterization of the key aroma compounds in a freshly prepared oat (Avena sativa L.) pastry by application of the sensomics approach.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Oat flour has a weak cereal-like, powdery aroma, which is significantly changed by a thermal process. Application of an aroma extract dilution analysis on a distillate obtained from oat pastry prepared under defined conditions led to the detection of 43 odor-active areas in the flavor dilution (FD) factor range of 2-8192. Among them, 3-(methylthio) propanal (cooked-potato-like), 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (roasty, popcorn-like), vanillin (vanilla-like), 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (clove-like), 1-octen-3-one (mushroom-like), 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline (roasty, popcorn-like), and (E, E, Z)-2,4, 6-nonatrienal (oat-like) were identified with the highest FD factors. Nine aroma compounds were identified for the first time in oats or oat products, and (E, E, Z)-2,4, 6-decatrienal, also showing an oat-like odor quality, is reported for the first time in foods. Quantitation of the 36 most important compounds by means of stable isotope dilution assays followed by a calculation of odor activity values on the basis of odor thresholds in corn starch revealed 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, vanillin, the tautomers 2-acetyl-3,4, 5,6-tetra-hydropyridine and 2-acetyl-1,4, 5,6-tetrahydropyridine, 3-(methylthio) propanal, 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline, and methanethiol as the key aroma-active compounds. An aroma recombinate prepared in odorless oat pastry material containing 30 odorants in the concentrations determined in the oat pastry was able to successfully mimic the overall aroma profile of the original oat pastry.										2021	69	5	1578	1588	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07498					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3401
J		Dach, A.; Schieberle, P.							Changes in the concentrations of key aroma compounds in oat (Avena sativa) flour during manufacturing of oat pastry.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Application of the aroma extract dilution analysis on the volatiles isolated from oat flour revealed 30 aroma-active compounds in the flavor dilution (FD) factor range of 2-8192, among which oat-flour-like smelling (E, E, Z)-2,4, 6-nonatrienal showed by far the highest FD factor. Quantitation performed by stable isotope dilution assays and a calculation of odor activity values (OAV; ratio of the concentration to odor threshold) of 23 odorants showed an OAV of above 1. Among them, vanillin, (E, E, Z)-2,4, 6-nonatrienal, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 3-methylbutanoic acid, and 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol showed the highest OAVs. In a heated (70°C for 30 min) oat dough prepared by kneading the oat flour in the presence of sucrose and water, 34 aroma-active compounds were identified, among which 17 compounds appeared with an OAV of ≥1. During frying, the weak cereal-like aroma of the oat flour and the oat dough was changed with the generation of an intense roasty, popcorn-like aroma attribute. A comparison to recently published data on oat pastry prepared by toasting of the same dough showed a clear increase in the overall aroma intensity from flour to pastry, in particular, in the popcorn-like, roasty odor impression. Especially considerable increases in the concentrations of the popcorn-like smelling compounds 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-acetyl-3,4, 5,6-and 2-acetyl-1,4, 5,6-tetrahydropyridine, 2-propionyl-1-pyrroline, and 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline were measured. In addition, the concentrations of the Strecker aldehydes 2-and 3-methylbutanal, phenylacetaldehyde, and 3-(methyldithio) propanal were also much increased during the toasting process. In contrast, in line with the overall aroma profile, particularly the concentration of the oat-like smelling compound (E, E, Z)-2,4, 6-nonatrienal was decreased during processing. The formation and precursors of the key aroma compounds are discussed.										2021	69	5	1589	1597	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07499					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3402

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) accumulates in tea leaves under dehydration stress during the withering process. However, the mechanism underlying ABA biosynthesis regulation remains largely unclear. In the present study, we found increased expression of ABA biosynthesis genes under dehydration stress during postharvest processing of tea. Furthermore, dehydration stress promoted ABA accumulation by increasing histone acetylation of ABA anabolism genes but by decreasing the levels of histone H3 lysine 9 dimethylation and DNA methylation of ABA biosynthesis genes. We screened candidate regulators of histone deacetylation and DNA methylation under dehydration stress. Taken together, our results indicate a role for epigenetic modifications during postharvest processing of tea.										2021	69	3	1039	1048	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07220					FSTA:2021-06-Hn5537

Microbiological hazards associated with food products imported from the Asia-Pacific region based on analysis of the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) notifications.		Food Control					The Rapid Alert System for Food and Feeds (RASFF) is a monitoring and notification tool and food safety-related database developed by the European Commission. This study evaluated the microbiological safety of foods originating from the Asia-Pacific region in the past two decades (2000-2020) by analysing incidences and trends of notifications and alerts on the RASFF database. The highest number of notifications were for foods imported from India and Thailand as foods imported from these two countries constituted more than half (54%) of the notifications recorded on the RASFF database for the entire Asia-Pacific region from 2000 to 2020, compared to ANZ (Australia and New Zealand), which had very low notifications (1.2%=23/1873). Among the 2121 notifications of pathogenic microorganisms, consisting of 14 genera, Salmonella was the most predominant as approximately 7 out of every 10 pathogens isolated from foods imported from the Asia-Pacific Region in the past two decades (74%, 1560/2121) were Salmonella species. More than 95% of pathogen species notifications for fruits and vegetables imported from India and Bangladesh were associated with betel leaves. Among the nuts, nut products and seeds, sesame seeds were the main food item contaminated by Salmonella, and these accounted for 87% of total Salmonella notifications. Across the food categories, there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of notifications associated with seafoods over the years (r =-0.73, p=0.0001). Although a statistically significant increase in notifications for fruits and vegetables (r=0.66, p=0.008) was recorded between 2000 and 2014, more recent years (2015-2020) have been associated with reducing trends in the number of notifications associated with this food type (r =-0.85, p=0.03). Results indicate that imported foods may be potential vehicles for the transmission of clinically relevant microorganisms. Studies of this nature can potentially encourage countries to implement policies that improve export quality.

Extracts from Almond (Terminalia catappa) leaf and stem bark mitigate the activities of crucial enzymes and oxidative stress associated with hypertension in cyclosporine A-stressed rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					We investigated the effect of extracts from the leaf (ALE) and stem bark (ABE) of Almond tree on activities of some crucial enzymes [angiotensin-1 converting enzyme (ACE), arginase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), adenosine deaminase (ADA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase], and thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) associated with hypertension in normal adult male Wistar albino rats and Cyclosporine A (CsA)-stressed rats. The result revealed that CsA-stressed rats treated with captopril and extracts (ALE and ABE) had lowered ACE, arginase, AChE, PDE-5, ADA activities, and TBARS level, coupled with improved SOD and catalase activities compared with untreated CsA-stressed rats, which had reversed these biochemicals compared to normal rats. This suggests that the extracts could be explored to suppress hypertension and other cardiac injury known with CsA treatment; the potentials that could be linked with the constituent polyphenols. However, further studies including blood pressure should be determined to ascertain this claim. Practical applications. Drug-induced cardiotoxicity, hypertension, and organ damage are among the most common side effects of pharmaceutics. Therefore, it becomes imperative to find natural, effective, and alternative therapy with little or no side effect to combat drug toxicity. The use of Almond (leaf and stem bark) in folklore for the treatment/management of hypertension and other heart-related diseases without full scientific basis is on the increase. Hence, this study provides some biochemical evidences on the effect of Almond leaf and stem back extracts on crucial enzymes and oxidative stress markers involve in the incidence of hypertension in the course of Cyclosporine A administration. The findings of this study indicated that the studied plant materials could be promoted as nutraceutical agents to neutralize drug-induced cardiac injury and hypertension. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Dadakova, K.; Jurasova, L.; Kasparovsky, T.; Prusova, B.; Baron, M.; Sochor, J.							Origin of wine lignans.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Plant lignans possess several properties beneficial for human health and therefore, increasing their contents in foods and beverages is desirable. One of the lignan sources in human diet is wine. To elucidate the origin of lignans contained in wine, LC-MS was used to analyze resinol-related lignans in must, seeds, stems, and wine prepared using stainless steel tanks, oak barrels, and Qvevri (clay vessel). White wines aged in stainless steel tanks contained significantly lower amounts of lignan aglycones (20-60 g/L) than red and Qvevri wines (300-500 g/L). Generally, white wines aged in stainless steel tanks contained only low amounts of isolariciresinol and matairesinol. Qvevri wines and red wine aged in stainless steel tank contained up to five lignan compounds and in wine aged in oak barrel, six different lignans were identified. Consistently, only low concentration of isolariciresinol has been found in must, whereas more lignan compounds have been found in grape seeds (isolariciresinol, secoisolariciresinol, and pinoresinol) and stems (isolariciresinol and syringaresinol). Consequently, we conclude that lignan content in wine can be increased by maturation in contact with grape berries, seeds, or stems or with wood.

J		Dadali, C.; Elmaci, Y.							Sweetness enhancement and sucrose reduction in cookies by inhomogeneous sucrose distribution.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Cookies are widely consumed bakery products having high amount of sucrose. In this study, it was aimed to reduce the amount of sucrose used in cookies by using the inhomogeneous distribution of sucrose while maintaining the perceived sweetness. Five different cookie samples were evaluated namely; control, 20% reduced sucrose cookies with Homogeneous distribution (HOM20) and Inhomogeneous distribution (INHOM20), 30% reduced sucrose cookies with Homogeneous distribution (HOM30) and Inhomogeneous distribution (INHOM30). Physical properties (diameter, height, spread ratio, L*, a*, and b*) of INHOM20 cookies were determined to be similar with control sample. Hardness value of control sample (30.43 N) was lower than HOM20 (36.59 N) and INHOM20 (33.09 N), HOM30 (41.32 N) and INHOM30 (38.23 N). Although the sucrose content was reduced 20% by inhomogeneous distribution, cookies had same sweetness and general acceptance with the control sample. The perceived sweetness of INHOM30 cookies was more than HOM30 cookies. The results obtained from this study showed that enhancement of sweetness perception and sucrose reduction could be provided using inhomogeneous sucrose distribution by changing sucrose distribution in cookies without using any sucrose substitute. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Goat farm variability affects milk Fourier-transform infrared spectra used for predicting coagulation properties.		Journal of Dairy Science					Driven by the large amount of goat milk destined for cheese production, and to pioneer the goat cheese industry, the objective of this study was to assess the effect of farm in predicting goat milk-coagulation and curd-firmness traits via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. Spectra from 452 Sarda goats belonging to 14 farms in central and southeast Sardinia (Italy) were collected. A Bayesian linear regression model was used, estimating all spectral wavelengths' effects simultaneously. Three traditional milk-coagulation properties [rennet coagulation time (min), time to curd firmness of 20 mm (min), and curd firmness 30 min after rennet addition (mm)] and 3 curd-firmness measures modeled over time [rennet coagulation time estimated according to curd firmness change over time (RCTeq), instant curd-firming rate constant, and asymptotical curd firmness] were considered. A stratified cross validation (SCV) was assigned, evaluating each farm separately (validation set; VAL) and keeping the remaining farms to train (calibration set) the statistical model. Moreover, a SCV, where 20% of the goats randomly taken (10 replicates per farm) from the VAL farm entered the calibration set, was also considered (SCV80). To assess model performance, coefficient of determination (R2VAL) and the root mean squared error of validation were recorded. The R2VAL varied between 0.14 and 0.45 (instant curd-firming rate constant and RCTeq, respectively), albeit the standard deviation was approximating half of the mean for all the traits. Although average results of the 2 SCV procedures were similar, in SCV80, the maximum R2VAL increased at about 15% across traits, with the highest observed for time to curd firmness of 20 mm (20%) and the lowest for RCTeq (6%). Further investigation evidenced important variability among farms, with R2VAL for some of them being close to 0. Our work outlined the importance of considering the effect of farm when developing Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy prediction equations for coagulation and curd-firmness traits in goats.

International Dairy Journal					Yoghurts were prepared by fermentation in the absence (control) or presence of different concentrations of inulin, tragacanth gum, or gellan gum, and effects of the biopolymers on physicochemical and sensory characteristics of yoghurts during cold storage were examined. No significant difference in pH, colour, total solid, and bacterial viability was observed among all the yoghurts prepared. Rheological analysis revealed that yoghurts prepared with biopolymers were pseudoplastic, and firmness and apparent viscosity were greater in yoghurts with added biopolymer than in control. Syneresis was weaker in yoghurts with added biopolymer, and showed a decreasing trend with biopolymer concentration but an increasing pattern with storage time due to gel shrinkage. Yoghurts with added biopolymer showed homogeneous and more compact microstructures than control. Yoghurt prepared with 0.01% tragacanth gum exhibited the best sensory scores. Results. Demonstrated that small amounts of tragacanth gum could effectively replace gellan gum as a thickener of synbiotic yoghurt.

J		Daeung Yu; Gicheol Kwon; Jihye An; Hyo Jin Kim; Donghwa Chung							Glass transition and stickiness characteristics of sea tangle powder fermented with Lactobacillus brevis.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Glass transition and stickiness characteristics of fresh and Lactobacillus brevis-fermented sea tangle powders, at different storage temperature and water activities (aw), were investigated. For both powders, glass transition temperature (Tg) decreased from 75 °C to-72 °C with increasing aw from 0 to above 0.9. Sticky point temperature (Ts) was higher than Tg by about 13-22 °C, and also decreased with increasing aw. Higher Tg and Ts values were measured for fermented powder, and for powders stored at higher temperatures. Microstructure analysis revealed water-induced particle aggregation and caking at aw>0.43. A storage stability study found that fermented powder was more stable than a fresh one, and a low storage temperature was preferred due to reduced molecular mobility. When stored at 4 °C, the fermented powder remained non-sticky as long as the aw remained below 0.8 (or the moisture content was below 0.76 g/g dry matter). Practical applications. Sea tangle (Saccharina japonica) contains gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a major inhibitory neurotransmitter having beneficial physiological effects, such as diuretic, hypotensive, and tranquilizing activities. Fermentation of sea tangle with Lactobacillus brevis can increase the amount of GABA by about 100 times. However, the use of fermented sea tangle powder is greatly limited because its moisture-induced stickiness and glass-to-rubbery state transition by strong hygroscopic nature significantly reduce the stability, safety, and quality of the powder during handling, processing, storage, and distribution. The present study provides a useful guideline for the safe and effective use of fermented sea tangle powder by providing information essential for understanding the relationships among the moisture sorption, glass transition, and stickiness of the powder. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15574					FSTA:2021-10-Rg3553

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Kaili Red Sour Soup (RSS) is a traditional fermented vegetable sauce made from red chili pepper and tomato, through special two-round anaerobic fermentations in southwest China, however, its physicochemical, microbial and flavor characteristics remain unclear. The pH value, total titratable acidity, amino acid nitrogen and nitrite of repined Kaili RSS were determined to be 3.26, 27.34 g/kg, 3.04 mg/kg and3.04 mg/kg, respectively. HPLC spectra showed 7 organic acids in RSS, and lactic acid (24.71 g/kg) and acetic acid (6.41 g/kg) mainly contribute to sour tastes. 15 Amino acids were found in RSS, and alanine (73.19 mg/100g) directly contributed to RSS's umami. The results of GC-MS illustrated totally 76 volatile organic compounds including alcohols, acids, esters, hydrocarbons, phenols, aldehydes, ketone and heterocycles, while alcohols (41.14%), acids (17.92%) and esters (29.37%) were dominant. Colony count number assay and rDNA amplicon-based high-throughput sequencing revealed 66 bacteria genera and 139 fungi during RSS fermentation, and Lactobacillus accounted for 94.81% in the first-round fermentation, while Pichia (49.71%), Dekkera (30.00%) and Saccharomyces (14.96%) were the dominant fungi in second-round fermentation. The Pearson correlation coefficient suggested that L. acetotolerans, Pichia, Dekkera and Saccharomyces could contribute mainly to the special flavors of Kaili RSS.

Characterising the influence of milk fat towards an application for extrusion-based 3D-printing of casein-whey protein suspensions via the pH-temperature-route.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study presents the design and characterisation of casein-whey protein suspensions (8.0/10.0% (w/w) casein and 2.0/2.5% (w/w) whey protein) mixed with dairy fat (1.0,2.5 and 5.0% (w/w) total fat) processed via the pH-temperature-route in preparation for 3D-printing. Mechanical treatment was applied to significantly decrease the particle size of the milk fat globules and increase surface area, creating small fat globules (<1 mum) covered with proteins, which could act as pseudo protein particles during gelation. Different proteins covered the fat globule surface after mechanical treatment, as a result of differences in the pH adjusted just prior to heating (6.55,6.9 or 7.1). The protein-fat suspensions appeared similar by transmission electron cryogenic microscopy and the zeta-potential of all particles was unchanged by the heating pH, with a similar charge to the solution (~-20 mV) occurring after acidification (pH 4.8/5.0) at low temperatures (2 °C). A low heating pH (6.55) resulted in increased sol-gel transition temperatures (G′=1 Pa) and a decreased rate of aggregation for protein-fat suspensions. A higher heating pH (6.9 and 7.1) caused an increased rate of aggregation (aggregation rate≥250 Pa/10 K), resulting in materials more promising for application in extrusion-based printing. 3D-printing of formulations into small rectangles, inclusive of a sol-gel transition in a heated nozzle, was conducted to relate the aggregation rate towards printability.

Food Hydrocolloids					The current interest in individualized food through additive manufacturing has identified a need for more information on the formulation and printability of potential ingredients. Here, the effect of formulation parameters of casein-whey protein suspensions like the pH (4.8-5.4) as well as the casein content (8.0-12.0% (w/w)) mixed with whey protein (2.0-3.0% (w/w)) and the effect of pre-processing parameters including the denaturation of whey proteins (80 °C, 10 min; adjusted pH 6.55, 6.9 and 7.1) on the gel formation via the pH-temperature (T)-route was studied. Rheological measurements showed that the sol-gel transition temperature (G=1 Pa) decreased and the aggregation rate of the casein-whey protein suspensions increased with increasing heating pH value. The aggregation rate was considered to be a key parameter predicting the printability of formulations. By exceeding a certain aggregation rate (250 Pa/10 K), casein-whey protein suspensions were found to be printable resulting in firm and stable gels. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Loss in fresh fruit and vegetables during transportation occurs mainly due to their susceptibility to mechanical damage. The quality loss caused by this damage depends on the shock and vibration frequencies. In this study, the effect of different vibration frequencies (5 Hz, 10 Hz, and 15 Hz) on the physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties of peach was investigated. The parameters such as energy absorption, mechanical hysteresis, and deformation volume were increased whereas mean geometric diameter, surface area, volume, degree of elasticity, deformation energy, and modulus of elasticity were decreased. Regarding physicochemical properties, pH and total soluble solid parameters increased whereas lightness (L*) value of peach decreased. The highest level of damage and mold growth were observed on the peach treated with 15 Hz frequency followed by 10 Hz and 5 Hz, respectively. The effect of all the frequencies on the physico-mechanical and physico-chemical properties of peach was statistically different. The results indicated that the increase in the vibration frequency causes higher mechanical damage in peach. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Nevertheless, particularly in developing economies demand for meat is rising whereas in high-income countries meat intake remains at high levels. Although many of today's Western consumers are unwilling to cut their meat consumption, it appears that a fraction is receptive to limit meat consumption by abstaining from eating meat occasionally. This is called flexitarianism. A great deal of hope has been placed lately on a flexitarian diet to help solving food-related environmental sustainability and human health problems. To determine whether flexitarianism can meet such high hopes, it is-to begin with-important to get an idea about the extent of contemporary food consumers' shift towards more meat-restricted diets. Such an overview has so far been lacking. Scope and approach. This study collected recent consumer research on meat eaters and meat reducers conducted in various affluent countries to explore the state of play in the field of flexitarianism. Key findings and conclusions. The present work demonstrates that multiple studies point to the existence of a group of flexitarians that is distinct from consumers who are deeply attached to meat eating and have no intention whatsoever to limit their meat intake, let alone are already changing meat-eating behaviours. Flexitarians not only differ from meat lovers but they also differ from each other. Against the backdrop of numerous devoted meat eaters, and flexitarians who frequently reduce their meat consumption only slightly, the question is raised whether flexitarianism is enough to tackle the pressing environmental and human health problems.

J		Dah-Sol Kim; Nami Joo							Feasibility of elder-friendly food applications of Sacha inchi according to cooking method: focusing on analysis of antioxidative activity and brain neuron cell viability.		Foods					One of the objectives of this study was to determine the effect of the cooking method on the antioxidant activity of Sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis). This work was focused on the importance of performing proper cooking for studying Sacha inchi. The result of this study sheds light on preventing nutritional loss with appropriate cooking methods. Three types of cooking processes were selected: uncooked, roasted at 160°C for 6min, boiled at 100°C for 13 min. The results of the present study indicated that roasted Sacha inchi is distinguishable for its high content of antioxidants (total polyphenol content 485.50muM, total flavonoid content 0.02mug/mL, DPPH free radical scavenging activity 33.05%, ferric reducing ability 0.19muM). The results of the present study also indicated that Sacha inchi uniquely promotes HT22 cell viability. With roasted Sacha inchi treatment, HT22 hippocampal neuronal cell showed a significantly increased number of growth (p< 0.001). Results also suggest that the development of tenderized Sacha inchi could help the elderly consumers achieve their target antioxidant provision in smaller portion sizes, thus curtailing the peril of sarcopenia. The mousse type of elderly food may also change the taste of many other nut consumers as they may opt to start selling and consuming Sacha inchi. It could be in the Sacha inchi industry's best interest to make certain all of the population's textural favors are catered. © 2021 by the authors.

Deployment of response surface methodology to optimize microencapsulation of peroxidases from turnip roots (Brassica rapa L.) by double emulsion in PLA polymer.		Journal of Food Science					In order to improve the preservation conditions and stability of peroxidase catalytic properties, a number of immobilization techniques have been widely developed. In this context, we set as objective, the optimization of synthesis and stability of microcapsules of peroxidases (POD) from turnip using polylactic acid (PLA) polymer with the double emulsion technique. The surfactant, polymer, and peroxidase concentrations were the optimized parameters. According to the results obtained using the Box-Behnken design, the optimal parameters found were 1.55% of PVA, 55 mg/mL of peroxidases, and 30 mg/mL of PLA polymer with an encapsulation efficiency of 57.29%. The scanning electron microscopy morphological characterization of the optimized microcapsules showed a regular spherical structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy identified the specific functional groups and chemical bonds before and after microencapsulation. The elaborated microcapsules were characterized by an average size of 200 m (mainly from 150 to 500 m) with a low residual moisture content (2.26%) and the encapsulated peroxidases showed better thermal stability. The in vitro release of peroxidases confirmed that the microcapsules have an excellent sustained release in simulated gastric digestion. Encapsulated peroxidases' storage under 25 and 4 °C displays a good residual POD activity with about 60% of initial activities during 80 days of storage, whereas free POD losses its initial activity within 15 and 30 days, respectively. The obtained results are promising for the development of effective therapeutic treatment of some intestinal troubles due to oxidative stress. Practical Application. Brassica rapa L. root is well known for its richness on peroxidases and thus presents an interesting potential for developing high added value products. In order to preserve the activity of extracted peroxidases (POD) from turnip roots, microencapsulation was optimized using a polylactic acid polymer. The encapsulated POD showed the maintenance of its activity under the effect of different storage conditions (time and temperature) and demonstrated resistance to gastric acidity. According to the obtained results, the encapsulation of peroxidases opens up medicine and pharmaceutical applications such as intestinal and colic protection against inflammations. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Gari is a common cassava precooked dried semolina in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study investigated the role of process parameters and mash water content on gari quality during traditional roasting stage. The statistical analysis for eight quality criteria revealed that gari quality is highly influenced by the process parameters adopted by the operators. To emphasise the twin impact of roasting parameters and mash water content, different mashes with varying water content were roasted leading to different adjustments of the roasting conditions according to the operators. When the variability of the water content becomes greater, a greater variability in the final quality of the obtained garis was observed between operators (lightness, swelling capacity, starch content, texture and colour). These results suggest that technological improvements to the gari process could be achieved by appropriate management of the roasting and dewatering parameters. © 2020 The Authors.

Role of dough viscoelastic properties and rice variety in the thermal expansion and the quality of unconventional rice-based bread: case of steamed-cooked "Ablo".		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Ablo is a rice-based bread consumed in Southern Benin. We investigated the impact of pre-cooking conditions and starch characteristics on dough and Ablo physical properties. The solid-like behaviour of doughs measured by rheological sweep tests appears significantly negatively correlated to Ablo quality; above a starch gelatinisation level (7%-8%), the solid-like behaviour of the doughs increased sharply and the fluidity decreased, leading to Ablo of poor quality. A comparison between three rice cultivars tends to show that rice with low amylose content and/or gelatinisation temperature gives dough with higher fluidity and Ablo with lower density. In addition, a specific rheological test for measuring simultaneously dough expansion and rheological properties during heating has been developed. It shows that whatever the rice variety, thermal expansion of proofed dough begins and is followed by a dough/crumb transition. This innovative rheological test could be used for studying dough/crumb transition for other types of breads. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Food Research International					Spreading is an indispensable process in the aroma formation of premium green tea. In this study, volatile metabolomics and transcriptomics were performed for three tea plant cultivars to investigate the mechanism of changes occurring in volatile compounds during green tea spreading. The content of primary aroma compounds significantly increased after spreading, the Wickremasinghe-Yamanishi ratio decreased and the Owuor's flavor index increased with the extension of spreading time, and the degree of aroma production was genotype-dependent. Volatile terpenes and fatty acid-derived volatiles were the principal aroma volatiles that accumulated during the spreading of green tea, and the trends of their changes were consistent with the expression pattern of related synthesis pathway genes, indicating that they were primarily derived from de novo synthesis rather than glycoside hydrolysis. Two co-expression networks that were highly correlated with variations in the volatile component contents during the spreading process were identified via WGCNA. Our results provide insights into spreading that can be considered to improve the quality of green tea.

Sensopeptidomic kinetic approach combined with decision trees and random forests to study the bitterness during enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics of micellar caseins.		Foods					Protein hydrolysates are, in general, mixtures of amino acids and small peptides able to supply the body with the constituent elements of proteins in a directly assimilable form. They are therefore characterised as products with high nutritional value. However, hydrolysed proteins display an unpleasant bitter taste and possible off-flavours which limit the field of their nutrition applications. The successful identification and characterisation of bitter protein hydrolysates and, more precisely, the peptides responsible for this unpleasant taste are essential for nutritional research. Due to the large number of peptides generated during hydrolysis, there is an urgent need to develop methods in order to rapidly characterise the bitterness of protein hydrolysates. In this article, two enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics of micellar milk caseins were performed for 9 h. For both kinetics, the optimal time to obtain a hydrolysate with appreciable organoleptic qualities is 5 h. Then, the influence of the presence or absence of peptides and their intensity over time compared to the different sensory characteristics of hydrolysates was studied using heat maps, random forests and regression trees. A total of 22 peptides formed during the enzymatic proteolysis of micellar caseins and influencing the bitterness the most were identified. These methods represent simple and efficient tools to identify the peptides susceptibly responsible for bitterness intensity and predict the main sensory feature of micellar casein enzymatic hydrolysates. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The metabolism of chlorogenic acid (CGA) through the intestinal tract was studied. As cadmium is a well-known toxic heavy metal, this study was carried out to investigate the comparative protective effect of CGA and its representative intestinal metabolite (3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, HPPA) against Cd-induced erythrocyte cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. We found that CGA and its intestinal metabolite appreciably prevented erythrocyte hemolysis, osmotic fragility, and oxidative stress induced by Cd. Also, we found that HPPA had a stronger protective ability than CGA against Cd-induced erythrocyte injury in vivo, such as increasing the ratio of protein kinase C from 7.7% (CGA) to 12.0% (HPPA). Therefore, we hypothesized that CGA and its microbial metabolite had protective effects against Cd-induced erythrocyte damage via multiple actions including antioxidation and chelation. For humans, CGA supplementation may be favorable for avoiding Cd-induced biotoxicity.										2021	69	13	3859	3870	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04735					FSTA:2021-08-Aj11539
J		Dai, L.; Cepeda, M.; Hinrichs, J.; Weiss, J.							Behavior of concentrated emulsions prepared by acid-hydrolyzed insoluble microalgae proteins from Chlorella protothecoides.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Microalgae are a promising alternative source to meet the increasing global demand for protein. The insoluble microalgae protein fraction that makes up over half of the protein composition of the biomass has shown potential to serve as a functional emulsifier after acidic hydrolysis. However, creaming was observed due to the flocculation of emulsion droplets, suggesting a preferable use in concentrated emulsions. Results. In this study, we examined the emulsifying behavior of the untreated insoluble microalgae protein fraction and two of its hydrolysates obtained in 0.5 mol L-1 HCl for 4 h at 65 °C (Hydrolysates 65) or 85 °C (Hydrolysates 85), at a concentration of 3% (w/w), and elevated levels of oil (50-70%). The results showed an increase in droplet size and apparent viscosity with increasing oil content in the emulsions. The emulsions made with Hydrolysates 85 had the smallest droplet size and the highest apparent viscosity. The gravitational separation was hindered when oil content was increased. The Hydrolysates 85 stabilized emulsions had a gel-like structure and were stable against coalescence or creaming during a 7 day storage test. Conclusion. The results suggest that the thermal acid-treated fraction Hydrolysates 85 may, in particular, be a good emulsifier to formulate concentrated emulsion-based foods with oil content over 50%, such as mayonnaise, salad dressings, or dips. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Dai, Q.; Wang, H.; Wang, Y.; Xiao, M.; Jin, H.; Li, M.; Xia, T.							Enhancing the sensory attributes and antioxidant properties of snus by mixing it with tea.		International Food Research Journal					In the present work, we investigated the chemical and volatile compositions of three tea-containing snus samples, after which their acceptability on the aromatic and taste coordination was evaluated by a professional panel. Results showed that the tea-containing snus samples exhibited better acceptability on the aroma and taste coordination profiles. Dahongpao tea (DT)-containing snus (DT-snus) exhibited the best acceptability of aromatic coordination, whereas the most favourable taste coordination was exhibited by Keemun black tea (KBT)-containing snus (KBT-snus). The antioxidant activity determined by the DPPH and ABTS assays revealed that Lu'an Guapian tea (LGT)-containing snus (LGT-snus) exhibited the highest free-radical scavenging ability. LGT-snus was also found to have the highest content of total polyphenols, amino acids, and caffeine. The highest levels of total flavonoids and soluble sugars were found in DT-snus and KBT-snus, respectively. There were 88, 68, and 74 volatiles found in DT-snus, LGT-snus, and KBT-snus, respectively, among which, nitrogenous compounds constituted the major category. High levels of nicotine, megastigmatrienone, neophytadiene, nicotyrine, and cotinine, which are the major volatiles in snus, were detected in the tea-containing snus samples. The mixing of tea introduced the flavour profiles of the volatiles present in the original tea into the tea-containing snus samples. Benzaldehyde, beta-ionone, hexanoic acid, 3-(Z)-hexenyl ester, pyrazines, and nerolidol from LGT; furfural, benzeneethanol, nerolidol, linalool, and cedrol from DT; and nonanal, geraniol, cis-jasmone, benzenemethanol, and methyl salicylate from KBT were found in high concentrations in the corresponding tea-containing snus samples.										2021	28	6	1141	1155	1985-4668									FSTA:2022-05-Hn4155
J		Dai-Yu Zhang; Jun-Ru Qi; Wen-Xin Jiang; Jin-Song Liao; Xiao-Quan Yang							Extraction and characterisation of pectin polysaccharide from soybean dreg and its dispersion stability in acidified milk drink.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, pectin polysaccharide (SDPP) was obtained from soybean dreg (26.2% yield), and characteristics of SDPP were compared with those of soybean soluble polysaccharides (SSPS) and citrus pectin (HMP). The galacturonic acid and molecular weight of SSPS, SDPP or HMP were 11.8%, 40.6% or 70.2% and 112, 446, or 440 kDa. SDPP had similar viscosity and protein content to SSPS, and functional groups and linear structure to HMP. SSPS, SDPP or HMP differed in particle size of 260,467 or 1195 nm and zeta-potential of -5.8, -14.6 or -23.5 mV at pH 4.0. The precipitation of acidified milk drink (AMD) was 6.31% without stabiliser or below 1.75% with 0.4% SDPP at pH 3.6-4.6. These results suggested that SDPP combines the structure and characteristic of HMP and SSPS, and AMD with SDPP had great stabilising behaviour at wider pH range (pH 3.6-4.6). © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	10	5230	5241	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15263					FSTA:2022-03-Pn1354
J		Daiki Murayama; Rankin, S. A.; Shinya Ikeda							Effect of surfactant-induced competitive displacement of whey protein conjugated to acid- or alkali-extracted potato pectin on emulsion stability.		Food Hydrocolloids					Covalently linked protein-polysaccharide conjugate pre-adsorbed to the interface often shows more enhanced resistance to displacement induced by competitively adsorbing small molecule surfactant than the pure protein component. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of surfactant-induced competitive displacement of whey protein-potato pectin conjugate pre-adsorbed to oil droplet surfaces on the stability of the oil-in-water emulsion. Potato pectin extracted in either an acidic or alkaline condition was conjugated to bovine milk whey protein using the Maillard reaction. The formation of covalent linkage between the protein and pectin moieties was confirmed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Atomic force microscopy studies of the interfacial films of the Maillard conjugates formed on flat water surfaces revealed that the alkali-extracted potato pectin provided more enhanced resistance to surfactant-induced competitive displacement from the air-water interface than the acid-extracted potato pectin. These results indicate that galactan side chains having an ability to self-assemble and form network structures had been preserved to a larger degree during the alkali-extraction. Furthermore, the alkali-extracted potato pectin prevented coalescence-induced increases in the oil droplet diameter in the oil-in-water emulsions prepared using the Maillard conjugate as the emulsifier upon the addition of up to 38.7 mM of the Tween 20 surfactant while maintaining relatively high levels of the surface load of protein (>0.8 mg/m2). The present results demonstrate that the molecular structure of the polysaccharide moiety of protein-polysaccharide conjugate has significant impacts on its resistance to competitive displacement and emulsion stability.

J		Dainton, A. N.; Dogan, H.; Aldrich, C. G.							The effects of select hydrocolloids on the processing of pate-style canned pet food.		Foods					Hydrocolloids are commonly used in canned pet food. However, their functional effects have not been quantified in this food format. The objective was to determine the effects of select hydrocolloids on batter consistency, heat penetration, and texture of canned pet food. Treatments were added to the formula as 1% dextrose (D) and 0.5% guar gum with 0.5% of either dextrose (DG), kappa carrageenan (KCG), locust bean gum (LBG), or xanthan gum (XGG). Data were analyzed as a 1-way ANOVA with batch as a random effect and separated by Fisher′s LSD at p< 0.05. Batter consistency (distance traveled in 30 s) thickened with increasing levels of hydrocolloids (thinnest to thickest: 23.63 to 2.75 cm). The D treatment (12.08 min) accumulated greater lethality during the heating cycle compared to all others (average 9.09 min). The KCG treatment (27.00 N) was the firmest and D and DG (average 8.75 N) the softest with LBG and XGG (average 15.59 N) intermediate. Toughness was similar except D (67 N. Mm) was less tough than DG (117 N. Mm). The D treatment showed the greatest expressible moisture (49.91%), LBG and XGG the lowest (average 16.54%), and DG and KCG intermediate (average 25.26%). Hydrocolloids influenced heat penetration, likely due to differences in batter consistency, and affected finished product texture. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Food Control					Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium is one of the most important serovars among nontyphoidal Salmonella. The inappropriate and over usage of antimicrobials in clinical and animal husbandry has increased the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). Diverse mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids, Insertion sequences and integrons also have a crucial role in the rapid dissemination of multidrug resistance (MDR) bacteria. This study aimed to screen and analyze the genetic environment of MGEs carried by S. Typhimurium, and to clarify the multidrug resistance dissemination mechanism in S. Typhimurium. The results showed that, out of 255 S. Typhimurium isolates, 62 isolates, were screened out for the presence of IncHI2 plasmid by PCR amplification, of which 61 isolates were carrying both IS 26 and class 1 integron. All the 61 isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial and 58 were MDR. The correlation between plasmids and antimicrobial resistance components was determined by conjugation, antimicrobial susceptibility test, PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) and S1-PFGE experiment. The results of PBRT revealed that 15 transconjugants harboring two kinds of plasmid incompatibility groups including HI2 and I1. Further, S1-PFGE validated the presence of HI2 plasmid in 13 and I1 plasmid in 2 transconjugants, which was about 200-300 kb and 80-100 kb in size, respectively. Whole genome sequencing revealed that no significant difference (P> 0.05) was found at the number of antimicrobial resistance gene categories among 15 donor isolates, and ST34 was the predominant sequence type. Phylogenetic analysis based on the complete plasmid sequences revealed 15 IncHI2 plasmids in this study clustered in two different clades and clustered together with other IncHI2 plasmids isolated from China, suggesting that the prevalence and dissemination of IncHI2 plasmids from diverse sources and regions. Four kinds of IS elements-class 1 integron arrangement patterns were identified in the 15 conjugative IncHI2-plasmids, of which three patterns were characterized to be complex IS 26-class 1 integron arrangement and the other one was IS 256-class 1 integron arrangement. Overall, these results suggested that IncHI2 was one of the major plasmid lineages presented in the MDR S. Typhimurium strains. Furthermore, the presence of complex IS elements-class 1 integrons and resistance genes co-located on IncHI2 plasmids contributed to the prevalence and rapid dissemination of multidrug resistance genes in Salmonella.

Food Analytical Methods					An effective method for monitoring the progress of rice wine fermentation (saccharification, glycolysis system, ethanol fermentation, and the TCA cycle) is required owing to the decreasing human resources in rice wine brewing and dramatically increasing export quantity of rice wine. This study aimed to develop an anion-exclusion/size-exclusion/reversed-phase chromatographic (AEC/SEC/RPC) separation protocol for the simultaneous determination of sugars, ethanol, inorganic, and organic acids for the effective monitoring of rice wine fermentation processes. Optimal chromatographic resolutions were obtained by the combination of a polymer-based size-exclusion column and H+-form weakly acidic cation-exchange resin column with a 20.0 mM phthalic acid eluent. The optimized AEC/SEC/RPC separation system determined 16 different species during rice wine fermentation in a single analysis. The developed AEC/SEC/RPC method demonstrated the below useful advantages for (1) evaluating the progress of rice wine fermentation; (2) evaluating the activity of brewing yeast from the behaviors of glucose, phosphate, and ethanol concentration; and (3) obtaining good correlation between the developed and official methods for monitoring glucose and ethanol. Consequently, several beneficial information was obtained for the process control of rice wine brewing by the developed method. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	14	2	290	299	1936-9751				10.1007/s12161-020-01868-3					FSTA:2021-06-Hc6377

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Aged pork fat, deeply oxidized pork fat soaked in basic liquor for more than half a year, is an important material in producing Chi-aroma Baijiu (CAB). With the expansion of production scale of CAB, innovative strategies for efficient production of aged pork fat are in great demand. The purpose of this study is to accelerate the lipid oxidation of pork fat and improve the productivity of aged pork fat. Results. results showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) were the main reactant; generation reactions of lipid peroxides and free fatty acids (FFAs) were two limiting steps during the preparation of aged pork fat. Processing under illumination could alleviate the first limiting step by increasing the peroxide value and p-anisidine value of pork fat to 16.22-and 28.48-fold higher than control samples and simultaneously the PUFAs were increased to 190.600.19gkg-1. Soaking in basic liquor with deeply oxidized fat oil could alleviate the second limiting step by transferring FFAs from fat oil into pork fat. With more oxidized PUFAs, the acid value of the pork fat was 7.91-fold higher than that of the control. Conclusion. Illumination and deeply oxidized fat oil could alleviate the two rate-limiting steps of lipid oxidation and improve the productivity of aged pork fat significantly. The results are highly applicable in the CAB industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	3	918	926	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10699					FSTA:2021-05-Hl4795

Food & Function					The thymus and spleen are the main reservoir for T lymphocytes, which can regulate the innate immune response and provide protection against pathogens and tissue damage. Oxidative stress, excessive inflammation, abnormal autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can all lead to dysfunction of the thymus and spleen. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of maternal 2-hydroxy-4-methylselenobutanoic acid (HMSeBA, an organic Se source) supplementation during pregnancy on the selenoprotein expression, inflammation, ER stress and autophagy of their young offspring's thymus and spleen. Thirty sows were randomly assigned to receive one of the following two diets during gestation: control diet (control, basal diet, n=15) or HMSeBA supplemented diet (HMSeBA, basal diet+0.3 mg Se kg-1 as HMSeBA, n=15). Tissues of thymus and spleen were collected from the offspring at birth and weaning after the lipopolysaccharide challenge. Results showed that maternal HMSeBA supplementation significantly up-regulated the gene expression of selenoproteins in the thymus and spleen of newborn piglets compared with the basal diet (p< 0.05), as well as the protein abundance of GPX1 and GPX4 (p< 0.05). In addition, maternal HMSeBA supplementation effectively decreased the expression of inflammation and autophagy related proteins in the thymus and spleen of newborn piglets as compared with the control group (p< 0.05). In weaning piglets, maternal HMSeBA significantly increased the antioxidative capacity of thymus and spleen (p< 0.05), and reversed LPS induced MDA content as compared with the control group (p< 0.05). Furthermore, maternal HMSeBA supplementation during gestation reversed the activation of the MAPK/NF-kappaB pathway, ER stress and autophagy induced by the LPS challenge in the thymus and spleen of weaning piglets (p< 0.05). In conclusion, maternal HMSeBA supplementation during gestation could decrease the level of inflammation, autophagy and ER stress in the thymus and spleen of young offspring by improving the antioxidative capacity and selenoprotein expression in these tissues. Therefore, maternal HMSeBA supplementation during gestation might be beneficial for the immune function of their offspring by alleviating inflammation, autophagy and ER stress levels in the thymus and spleen. This study showed more evidence for the function of Se on mater-offspring integrated nutrition. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	22	11214	11228	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01653a					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4146

Fructose-rich diet and walnut supplementation differently regulate rat hypothalamic and hippocampal glucose transporters expression.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Nutritional modulations may be considered a strategy to protect mental health. Neuronal homeostasis is highly dependent on the availability of glucose, which represents the primary energy source for the brain. In this study, we evaluated the effects of walnut intake and fructose-rich diet on the expression of glucose transporters (GLUTs) in two rat brain regions: hypothalamus and hippocampus. Results. Our results show that walnut supplementation of fructose-fed animals restored the hypothalamic content of GLUT1 and GLUT3 protein. Furthermore, walnut intake did not affect increased hypothalamic GLUT2 content upon fructose consumption. These effects were accompanied by distinctive alterations of hippocampal GLUTs levels. Specifically, walnut intake increased GLUT1 content, whereas GLUT2 protein was decreased within the rat hippocampus after both individual and combined treatments. Conclusion. Overall, our study suggests that walnut supplementation exerted modulatory effects on the glucose transporters within specific brain regions in the presence of developed metabolic disorder. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Dakwa, V.; Powell, S.; Eyles, A.; Gracie, A.; Tamplin, M.; Ross, T.							Effect of peroxyacetic acid treatment and bruising on the bacterial community and shelf-life of baby spinach.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The importance of leaf integrity, i.e. the effects of bruising (mechanical damage), and sanitisation with peroxyacetic acid (PAA) on bacterial communities of ready-to-eat baby spinach remains unclear. Two shelf-life studies were conducted at 4 °C to investigate the effect of bruising and sanitisation on the growth of spoilage microorganisms. In the first experiment, both bruising treatments (100% and 40% of leaves) halved shelf life to 12 d, whereas intact leaves had a shelf-life of 23 d. Bruising had no influence on bacterial diversity during shelf-life, though some differences in the relative abundance of minor genera were observed. Pseudomonas and Pantoea were the most dominant bacterial genera, regardless of bruising treatment. High throughput amplicon sequencing also identified other spoilage bacteria including Chryseobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, Sphingobacterium, Erwinia and Flavobacterium. In the second experiment, washing of intact baby spinach with a sanitiser (80 mg/L: PAA) reduced microbial load as determined by aerobic plate count but did not immediately affect the presence/relative abundance of most of the genera of spoilage bacteria observed. During shelf-life, the bacterial diversity of sanitised leaves was significantly lower than on water-washed leaves. Although sanitisation resulted in a higher initial log reduction in microbial load compared to control (portable tap water), sanitisation did not extend the shelf life of baby spinach (23 d). Sanitised spinach had reduced bacterial diversity however, by the end of shelf life, both sanitised and water-washed spinach was dominated by Pseudomonas and Pantoea spoilage bacteria. This study demonstrated for the first time that the shorter shelf life of bruised leaves was related to faster microbial growth rather than changes in bacterial diversity or community composition.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Overexposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation induces photoaging that is characterized by the formation of wrinkles and loss of skin elasticity. To understand the mechanism of action of probiotics and prebiotics in skin protection against photoaging, we investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with the probiotic, Bifidobacterium longum, and prebiotic, galacto-oligosaccharide, on UVB-induced photoaging in hairless mice. We measured short chain fatty acid (SCFA) levels, antioxidant enzyme activity, and inflammatory signaling protein levels to elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying the effects of the dietary supplements B. longum and galacto-oligosaccharide. We observed that dietary supplementation with B. longum and galacto-oligosaccharide, individually and in combination, exerted protective effects against UVB-induced photoaging, showing anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. In particular, supplementation with the combination of B. longum and galacto-oligosaccharide showed stronger protective effects than supplementation with the probiotic or prebiotic alone. In addition, the serum levels of SCFAs and acetate were increased following dietary supplementation with B. longum and galacto-oligosaccharide, especially in combination. Therefore, we suggest that the combination of B. longum and galacto-oligosaccharide may potentially be used as a functional food to protect UVB-induced photoaging.										2021	24	6	606	616	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0032					FSTA:2022-01-Ge0316
J		Dala-Paula, B. M.; Starling, M. de F. V.; Gloria, M. B. A.							Vegetables consumed in Brazilian cuisine as sources of bioactive amines.		Food Bioscience					Polyamines contribute to longevity and a high dietary consumption of spermidine, or its supplementation, exerts cardioprotective effects and can increase lifespan. Bioactive amines have a significant effect on human health and disease. Ten bioactive amines were investigated in the edible parts of 12 different vegetables, typical of the Brazilian cuisine: broccoli, cauliflower, eggplant, jilo (scarlet eggplant), tomato, green onion, parsley, spinach, capers, cassava, heart of palm and bean sprouts. Free amines were extracted with 5% trichloroacetic acid, separated using ion-pair reverse phase HPLC and quantified fluorometrically after post-column derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde. The average total amines ranged from 0.47 to 4.51 mg/100 g, except for eggplant and bean sprouts, which were >10 mg/100 g. Spermidine was the most frequent amine in all the vegetables, followed by putrescine, agmatine and spermine. Histamine was found in eggplant, jilo, tomato (all from the Solanaceae family), spinach, parsley, capers and bean sprouts. Tyramine was also found in fruits of the Solanaceae family, green onion, spinach, parsley and heart of palm. Cadaverine was only found in bean sprouts. The neuroactive amines, serotonin, 2-phenylethylamine and tryptamine were found at trace concentrations in some vegetables. The skin and the core of eggplant had higher histamine than the pulp; therefore, distribution of amines depends on vegetable portion, which can be reduced for sensitive individuals to avoid histamine intoxication.

Food Chemistry					Chocolate is an important source of free bioactive amines and amino acids which play important roles in human health. Considering the limited information on the bioaccessibility of these compounds from chocolate, the objective of this study was to characterize their profiles and bioaccessibility in 70% cocoa dark chocolate through in vitro simulation of oral, gastric and intestinal digestions. Seven amines were detected; polyamines were predominant before in vitro digestion, whereas tyramine, cadaverine and spermidine after digestion. All amines showed high bioaccessibility with slight influence of digestive enzymes. Amines increased after gastrointestinal digestion: tyramine (13-fold), tryptamine (9-fold), others (2.4-4.2-fold) and histamine appeared. All amino acids, GABA and ammonia were detected in chocolate, and their contents increased after in vitro digestion due to digestive enzymes (4.6, 2.8 and 2.1, respectively). Dark chocolate protein is a good source of tryptophan, phenylalanine+ tyrosine, isoleucine, histidine, but limiting for lysine, leucine, and threonine. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Dalal Albosharib; Mohammad Noshad; Hossein Jooyandeh; Zaki Dizaji, H.							Effect of freezing and radiofrequency pretreatments on quality and kinetics of convective air-drying of potatoes.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of freezing and radiofrequency (RF) pretreatments on drying kinetics and qualitative properties of hot air-dried potatoes were evaluated. Results. Showed that the use of an RF pretreatment before potatoes drying reduced the color changes, firmness, and increased shrinkage, rehydration ratio, and the effective diffusion coefficient. Whereas, the amount of activation energy was reduced by applying freezing and RF pretreatments. So that the amount of activation energy from 28.820.4 kJ/mol (control sample) to 22.840.1 kJ/mol (sample treated with CF), and 19.930.2 kJ/mol (sample treated with CF and RF) decreased. The Henderson-Pubis model with the highest R2 and the lowest RMSE and chi2 was selected as the best model. Freezing pretreatment has weakened the tissue and created cell holes in the samples. When using RF, the amount of damage to the cell wall is greater, which makes the samples have a more porous structure using scanning electron microscopy. Practical applications. Potatoes are one of the four main foods of the people of the world. Most of the potatoes produced are stored for use in the food industry. Due to the problems of storage, transportation, and seasonality of potato production, drying can be used as a suitable method to reduce potato waste. The most common method of drying is the use of hot air drying, which involves the simultaneous transfer of mass and heat. Since hot air drying uses high temperatures or long time, which in addition to high energy consumption and time-consuming process, causes some undesirable physical and chemical changes such as changes in color, flavor, and reduction of nutrients and shrinkage in the product. Therefore, using other drying methods or using pretreatment, the quality of the dried product can be maintained in a desirable. So far no research has been done on the use of CF and RF as a pretreatment in the potato drying. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of freezing pretreatments on drying kinetics and quality characteristics of hot air-dried potatoes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16062					FSTA:2022-04-Jl4651

Adherence to the Mediterranean diet is an independent predictor of circulating vitamin D levels in normal weight and non-smoker adults: an observational cross-sectional study.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					We explored the association between circulating 25OHD and adherence to the Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) in 402 Greek (21-65years, 188 men and 214 women), normal weight, non-smoker, healthy volunteers in the Athens metropolitan area during summer and autumn, taking into account skin phototype, anthropometric, and lifestyle variables. Circulating 25OHD, parathormone, creatinine, calcium, and phosphate were determined. A vitamin D status of ≤25, ≤50, and ≤75nmol/L was observed in 4.5, 37.3, and 74.1% of the subjects, respectively. The independent predictors of 25OHD deficiency were autumn, darker skin phototype, BMI, or waist circumference (WC), sunscreen use, less physical outdoor activity, and less adherence to the MedDiet. Higher intake of fish and olive oil was a positive independent predictor of elevated circulating 25OHD levels. In conclusion, higher adherence to the MedDiet, fish and olive oil consumption, were positively associated with circulating 25OHD independently from BMI or WC, skin phototype, season, and physical activity. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

J		Dali Zhang; Haishan Xu; Bing Jiang; Xinyu Wang; Lvzhu Yang; Yang Shan; Shenghua Ding							Effects of ultra-high pressure on the morphological and physicochemical properties of lily starch.		Food Science & Nutrition					In this study, starch extracted from lily bulbs were modified using an ultra-high pressure (UHP) treatment at six different pressure levels (100,200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 MPa). The effects of UHP treatment on the physicochemical and morphological properties of lily starch were investigated. The morphological observation revealed that UHP treatment led to particle expansion and aggregation. Compared with the native and lily starch treated at 100-500 MPa, the lily starch treated at 600 MPa exhibited almost completely disrupted morphology and a larger particle size, indicating nearly complete gelatinization of the starch. The relative crystallinity of the UHP-treated starch remarkably reduced. Gelatinization temperatures via differential scanning calorimetry decreased with increasing pressure. The rapid viscoanalyzer results revealed that the lily starch treated with UHP at 600 MPa showed low values of peak viscosity, trough viscosity, breakdown, final viscosity, and setback. These results indicated that UHP was an effective physical modification method for lily starch, UHP treatment (600 MPa, 30 min) caused nearly complete gelatinization of lily starch, and lily starch modified using UHP might expand the application of lily in the food field. © 2020 The Authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The current study was aimed to prepare a rice bean-based protein-rich premix for elderly population, which can meet their minimum daily dietary requirement in addition to their regular diet. A process for the formulation using rice bean, chickpea, skimmed milk powder, and stevia was optimized. The mixture containing different amounts of ingredients was analyzed for functional properties, antioxidant activity, phytochemical properties, and sensory properties. The optimized product had 56.72 g rice bean, 25.02 g chickpea, 27.75 g skimmed milk powder, and 0.94 g stevia powder. The product contained good amount of bioactive compounds and was rich in nutrients, particularly, vitamin C and protein. As rice bean was a significant variable in the formulation, it could be effectively used for development of specific nutrition-rich products for the elderly. The premix has good nutritional value and potentially meets the minimum nutritional needs of elderly population. Practical applications. The current health food market is saturated with lots of foods that are aimed at infant, preschool children, and athletes. A new relevant segment is on the growth in the form of geriatric nutrition and people are understanding the need and care that elderly require in terms of nutrition and specific foods. The current work aims to introduce a ready-to-reconstitute geriatric premix using rice bean as an underutilized source of protein and other nutrients. Moreover, simple techniques that could very well be used in small-to large-scale industries are used to prepare the product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16075					FSTA:2022-04-Jp4647
J		Damar, I.; Gulec, H. A.							Hydrophilic modification of poly(ether)sulfone membrane by atmospheric pressure argon jet plasma: pH dependence of ultrafiltration performance and cleaning efficiency.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The studies focused on plasma surface modification of poly (ether) sulfone (PES) ultrafiltration (UF) membrane show its potent effect on antifouling propensity but there are few data on the pH dependence of superior surface character achieved. This study examined UF performance and cleaning efficiency of atmospheric pressure argon jet plasma (AP-AJP) modified PES membrane in whey concentration at various operation pH compared to the plain membrane (UP020). The highest initial permeate flux for the UP020 at pH of 6.4 increased the cake layer formation and the irreversible fouling resistance. The plasma action led to greater intrinsic membrane resistance causing low water permeability compared with the UP020. This effect reduced cake layer resistance despite the fact that the irreversible fouling was more severe at all operation pH. The increase in pH caused to decrease in contribution of fouling to total resistance. For the UP020, the shift in operation pH from acidic point to neutral reduced the recovery in hydraulic permeability after chemical cleaning. The plasma action induced greater cleaning efficiency, which is the most obvious at pH of 6.4. The overall results showed that the AP-AJP may have the potential to maintain profit-making UF process in whey concentration at broad range of pH. Practical Applications. In the industrial point of view, cost friendly, and sustainable operation in valorization of whey can be achieved by fouling resistant membranes. Atmospheric pressure argon jet plasma provides extremely hydrophilic character to poly (ether) sulfone membrane. The plasma action decreases fouling resistance and especially cake layer formation. This effect broadens the operating pH of whey without any pre-adjustment and results in easy to clean membrane surfaces. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Quality and Preference					Healthiness is an often-reported consideration related to the snack choice of mothers for their children. Mothers' perceived healthiness of a certain snack could be diverse and different compared to the actual nutritional healthiness of that specific snack. Diary studies and in-depth interviews with 22 Dutch mothers were conducted. During the interviews, four different types of cookies were presented and discussed. Data from the diaries and the interviews were transcribed, coded and grouped and presented in tables. All mothers mentioned health as a consideration while providing snacks both in the interviews and in the diaries. For more than two-thirds of the mothers, health was the most important consideration. Three types of mothers were defined according to healthiness perception: "product mothers", who related the healthiness of a snack to the intrinsic product properties, the "balancing mothers" who related the healthiness of the snack to the whole diet and the context, and the "not that important mothers", for whom the healthiness of a snack was not that relevant because the healthy foods were already eaten during the main meals. The results of this study could be used for efficient communication to help mothers meet children's dietary requirements and they could be relevant for the design of new snack products.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Three foodborne pathogenic bacteria, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli are major contaminants in various foods and often cause food safety problems in public health. Therefore, a simple Taqman probe based multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (mRT-PCR) for fast and reliable presence test to detect those three bacterial targets in different types of foods were developed. In order to improve the effectiveness of the developed method, a culturing step in Simultaneous Enrichment Broth at 37 °C for 18 h, followed by extraction of DNA using a boiling method was included. The developed Taqman mRT-PCR platform gave all 100% of relative sensitivity, relative specificity and relative accuracy as compared to the conventional method (Bacteriological Analytical Manual) and iQ-check RT-PCR detection kits. The results showed the developed method could detect as low as 1 CFU of each bacterial target in 25 g of artificially contaminated food samples. For practical food testing, the detection results of the bacterial targets naturally contaminated in 92 food samples by both the developed Taqman probe mRT-PCR and the conventional method were essentially identical. The developed method is greatly specific, sensitive and effective to detect the three bacteria in foods simultaneously.

J		Dammak, I.; Sobral, P. J. do A.							Curcumin nanoemulsions stabilized with natural plant-based emulsifiers.		Food Bioscience					The effect of natural plant-based emulsifiers, citrus peel pectin, and gum Arabic, on the stability of oil-in-water (O/W) nanoemulsions encapsulating curcumin using a microfluidizer were studied. Pectin was more efficient than gum Arabic for nanoemulsions formation, with lower amounts of emulsifier (2% w/w) needed for the generation of smaller droplets (d3,2-220 nm). The stability of prepared nanoemulsions was measured using the LUMiSizer analytical centrifugation test. The results showed that pectin gave better protection against droplet coalescence with temperature (40-60°C). However, gum Arabic provided more protection of oil droplets from coalescence against a series of environmental treatments, including a range of pH variations (3-9) and NaCl additions (100-500 mM). Both emulsifiers showed adequate protection against freeze-thawing treatment. Furthermore, droplet size aggregation was more critical in pectin-stabilized emulsions during 7 days of storage at 4°C. These results were explained by the formation of bridging flocculation within the pectin biopolymers. However, gum Arabic gave greater curcumin retention (85%) and stability against degradation compared to pectin (70%) after 7 days of storage. This was attributed to the thick and high-density layers formed by gum Arabic, which could provide better physical and chemical barriers against environmental stresses. The results from this study offer important information in developing "label friendly" products for encapsulating labile lipophilic bioactive compounds for use in the food and beverage industries.

Post-harvest fungal occurrence on commercial strawberry cultivars grown in Australia: impact of phytochemical composition.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this study was to isolate and identify the spoilage fungi from four Australian grown commercial strawberry cultivars, namely Fortuna, Festival, Ruby Gem, and Red Rhapsody, and to investigate their correlation with the studied physicochemical properties in all four cultivars. To further understand the differences in postharvest resistance behavior of strawberries, the correlation between chemical composition, in particular pelargonidin-3-glucoside (the major anthocyanin in strawberry), and fungal decay was studied. Results showed significant differences in (poly) phenolic content between the four investigated cultivars, in particular total phenolics and pelargonidin-3-glucoside. Moreover, the studied strawberries significantly varied (p<0.05) in other evaluated parameters such as pH, sugars, and ascorbic acid. The Red Rhapsody cultivar with higher contents of total phenolics and pelargonidin-3-glucoside exhibited higher resistance to fungal growth, which was further confirmed by the results of principal component analysis. Findings from this study could benefit the food industry through lessening postharvest spoilage by breeding strawberries with higher polyphenolic content. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Tea market is currently oversupplied, and unsold tea often needs to be properly stored for a period of time. However, the chemical changes occurring in black tea during storage are limitedly understood. In this study, a comprehensive nontargeted and targeted metabolomics approach was used to investigate the dynamic changes in compounds in time-series (0-19 months)-stored black teas. The contents of flavanols, theaflavins (TFs), theasinensins, procyanidins, most phenolic acids, amino acids, quercetin-O-glycosides, and myricetin-O-glycosides decreased during storage, while the contents of N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavanols, flavone-C-glycosides, and most kaempferol-O-glycosides increased. More importantly, four novel compounds strongly positively correlated with storage duration (r = 0.922-0.969) were structurally assigned as N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted TFs and validated with synthetic reactions of TFs and theanine standards.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The improper use of diuretics in veterinary practices may lead to their presence in animal-derived foods, which could cause the inadvertent poisoning of consumers and doping of athletes that consume these contaminated products. Herein, we describe the analytical method that we developed to monitor diuretic residues in foods, which comprises an optimized, modified QuEChERS pre-treatment technique and subsequent high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) analysis. This method was employed to simultaneously analyze seven diuretics in 120 animal-derived food samples, which included porcine muscle, bovine muscle, lamb muscle, rabbit muscle, milk, and eggs. The method included 2 g of each animal-derived food samples with 15mL acetonitrile and 2.0 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate for extracting. After vortex and centrifugation, the resulting liquid was purified using primary secondary amine (100mg), octadecylsilane (100mg), and MgSO4 (600mg). Under optimal conditions, the limits of quantitation were lower than 2mug/kg for all analytes. The recoveries were in the range of 72.1-118.1% at three fortified levels with relative standard deviations of less than 17.3%. All the tested samples showed negative results for the diuretics.

J		Dan Hai; Xianqing Huang; Lianjun Song							Effects of different modified atmosphere treatments on lipid oxidation in spiced beef at different storage temperatures.		Food Science & Nutrition					The high moisture and nutrient contents of spiced beef make it popular with consumers but present challenges for its storage, as spoilage is a common phenomenon. Therefore, for identifying packaging methods to reduce spoilage during storage, this study investigated the effects of 5% O2 (low oxygen), 70% CO2 (high carbon dioxide), and 5% O2/70% CO2/25% N2 (compound group) on lipid oxidation in spiced beef in the test groups and a vacuum-packed group (control) at storage temperatures of 4, 25, and 60 °C. The pH, thiobarbituric acid (TBA), anisidine value (AV), and peroxide value (POV) of the spiced beef were determined. Results indicated that 70% CO2 and storage at 4 and 25 °C showed the strongest ability to inhibit the rancidity in spiced beef. The 5% O2 group delayed both initial oxidation and secondary oxidation of lipids. Although the compound group significantly inhibited the rancidity in spiced beef at 60 °C, it could not maintain such inhibition for long. Among all the groups, the 70% CO2 group demonstrated maximum inhibition of initial lipid oxidation and suppressed the secondary oxidation of lipids for the longest time. Thus, the modified atmosphere packaging with O2 and CO2 can regulate the fat oxidation in meat products and effectively improve their flavor maintenance. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Dan Hai; Zhaoxin Lu; Xianqing Huang; Fengxia Lv; Xiaomei Bie							In vitro screening of chicken-derived Lactobacillus strains that effectively inhibit Salmonella colonization and adhesion.		Foods					Inhibition of Salmonella by Lactobacillus has been a popular research topic for decades; however, the inhibition potential of chicken-derived Salmonella by chicken-derived Lactobacillus has not yet been studied. In this study, 89 strains of Lactobacillus from chicken intestines were isolated by national standard method, Gram staining, physiological, and biochemical experiments and molecular sequencing; The inhibition characteristics of 89 strains of chicken derived Lactobacillus against 10 strains Salmonella (S. Enteritidis SE05, SC31, SC21, SC72 SC74, SC79, SC83, SC87; S. bongori SE47; S. Typhimurium, SC85) were detected by agar inhibition zone, The results showed that the inhibition zone of 24 strains of chicken derived Lactobacillus was more than 10 mm, which indicated that the isolated chicken derived Lactobacillus could effectively inhibit the growth of Salmonella; The drug resistance and bile salt tolerance of these 24 strains were analyzed, The results showed that the standard strains LG and L76 were not resistant, and the other 22 Lactobacillus strains showed different degrees of resistance. The strains LAB24, LAB26, LAB53, LAB69, and L76 showed good tolerance at the concentration of 3 g/L bile salt; Caco-2 cell experiment and flow cytometry were used to analyze the inhibitory effect of chicken derived Lactobacillus on the adhesion of Salmonella to Caco-2 cells, The results showed that 16 probiotics could effectively inhibit the adhesion of Salmonella to Caco-2 cells. Twelve probiotics were identified by molecular biology. The results showed that L76 was Enterococcus faecalis, and the other 11 strains were Lactobacillus. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					Lipid accumulation is a major factor in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Currently, there is a lack of intervention or therapeutic drugs against NAFLD. In this study, we investigated the ability of Sargassum fusiforme polysaccharide (SFPS) to reduce lipid accumulation induced by high sugar in HepG2 cells and Drosophila melanogaster larvae. The results indicated that SFPS significantly (p<.01) decreased the accumulation of lipid droplets in high sugar-induced HepG2 cells. Furthermore, SFPS also suppressed the expression of Srebp and Fas (genes involved in lipogenesis) and increased the expression of PPARalpha and Cpt1 (genes that participated in fatty acid beta-oxidation) in these cells. SFPS markedly reduced the content of triglyceride of the third instar larvae developed from D. melanogaster eggs reared on the high-sucrose diet. The expression of the Srebp and Fas genes in the larvae was also inhibited whereas the expression of two genes involved in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, Acox57D-d and Fabp, was increased in the larval fat body (a functional homolog of the human liver). We also found that SFPS ameliorated developmental abnormalities induced by the high-sucrose diet. These results of this study suggest that SFPS could potentially be used as a therapeutic agent for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Research International					Soybean milk is an economical substitute for dairy products. Pediococcus pentosaceus has been used as a food additive to improve taste, nutrition, and food safety. In this study, four P. pentosaceus strains (CICC 24444, QK-1, MQ-1 and RQ-1) isolated from various food sources and known to exhibit broad-spectrum antibacterial activities were used to ferment soybean milk, and their fermentation characteristics and the properties of the resulting beverages were evaluated. The results revealed that the P. pentosaceus strains can inhibited the growth of five types of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serotype Enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella dysenteriae, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus), and their in vitro survival rates in the simulated stomach and intestinal environments were above 90%, satisfying the probiotic requirements. Isomaltose oligosaccharide was used as a protective agent to resist low-temperature freeze-drying damage and ensure a high survival rate, and P. pentosaceus was directly injected into fermented soymilk. The acidification of fermented soybean milk was the weakest with P. pentosaceus QK-1, and the viable bacterial counts of all strains were stable after 28 days of storage. After fermentation, the antioxidant ability was enhanced. Arginine and beta-alanine levels increased after fermentation, and the adjunct culture of P. pentosaceus QK-1 increased proline levels. Our data indicate that P. pentosaceus QK-1 is a suitable strain for the development of functional plant-based beverages.

J		Dan Huang; Kaiyang Men; Xiaohong Tang; Wei Li; Sa Sherif							Microwave intermittent drying characteristics of Camellia oleifera seeds.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This paper reports on an experimental investigation of the drying characteristics and kinetics of Camellia oleifera seeds under microwave intermittent drying conditions. The effects of key parameters such as microwave power, heating time, and the length of the intermittent time are discussed in detail. The energy consumption in the drying process along with the main quality parameters of camellia oil, namely the peroxide and acid values, have also been determined and compared with hot-air drying. Results show that the microwave drying curve consists of an acceleration rate period, a constant rate period and a falling rate period. As the microwave power and heating time increase, the drying time decreases. While as the length of the intermittent time increases, the drying time increases. The hot-air drying time was found to be much longer than microwave drying time, and the energy consumed during hot-air drying was also several hundred times higher than that used during microwave intermittent drying. The acid and peroxide values of camellia oil after hot-air and microwave drying were both within the allowable range in the National Standard of China. The Midilli and Kucuk model was the best model to describe the kinetics of the drying process. Practical applications. Drying is the first step in the processing of Camellia oleifera seeds, which not only affects the storage of Camellia oleifera seeds, but also affects the quality of camellia oil, and has thus become a research hotspot in recent years. However, several disadvantages of hot-air drying have been identified like the slowness of the drying process and the relatively large energy consumption. Therefore, finding a drying method that is more suitable is necessary. Microwave intermittent drying is a type of discontinuous drying. The moisture and temperature inside the material can be evenly redistributed during the intermittent time, so that the material is not overheated. This feature of preserving the quality of the products to be dried has made microwave intermittent drying attractive and has been successfully applied to agricultural, forestry, and food products. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13608					FSTA:2021-04-Ne0967
