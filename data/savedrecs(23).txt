Pegler.		Food Chemistry					Macrolepiota albuminosa (Berk.) Pegler is abundant in active polysaccharides, but little is known about their structures and solution properties. In this study, water-extracted polysaccharides from M. albuminosa (MAWP) were purified into three fractions with structural heterogeneity, which was attributed to the diversity in molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and linkage patterns, further affecting their solution properties. Methylation and NMR analysis revealed MAWP-60p and MAWP-70 were a 3-O-methylated glucomannogalactan and a previously unreported glucomannogalactan, whereas MAWP-80 was elucidated as a branched galactoglucan. Besides, three fractions exhibited random coil conformation in aqueous solution, while MAWP-60p had the highest viscosity due to its highest molecular weight, mean square radius of gyration (Rg) and O-methyl group attached to the backbone. The molecular weight, monosaccharide composition and glycosidic linkages might be the major contributors to the flexibility, molecular size and stereochemistry of mushroom polysaccharide chains.

J		Yu-Xiao Wang; Yue Xin; Xiao-Jun Huang; Jun-Yi Yin; Shao-Ping Nie							A branched galactoglucan with flexible chains from the basidioma of Macrolepiota albuminosa (Berk.) Pegler.		Food Chemistry					A homogeneous galactoglucan was purified from the alkali-extracted polysaccharides from the basidioma of Macrolepiota albuminosa by gradient ethanol precipitation, whose proposed structure was given for the first time. Results. Showed it had a molecular weight of 210 kDa, and mainly consisted of glucose and galactose. There were abundant filaments, randomly distributed sheet-like and flaky appearance in its surface by SEM observation. Its backbone comprised beta-(1 6)-Glc p, alpha-(1 6)-Gal p and beta-(1 3,6)-Glc p residues at 4:1:1, terminated by beta-(1 3)-Glc p and T-Glc p residues. Rheological measurements suggested its steady flow behavior was highly dependent on concentrations. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentrations, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentrations. Besides, the X-ray diffraction patterns proved the presence of amorphous structure. The conformational parameters were detected by HPSEC-MALLS-RI, revealing a random coil conformation in NaNO3 aqueous solution. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of polysaccharides from M. albuminosa in food-and drug-based therapies.

J		Yu-Xiao Wang; Ting Zhang; Jun-Yi Yin; Xiao-Jun Huang; Jun-Qiao Wang; Jie-Lun Hu; Shao-Ping Nie							Structural characterization and rheological properties of an alkali-extracted beta-glucan from Hypsizygus marmoreus.		Food Hydrocolloids					A homogeneous beta-glucan (JHMP-70) was obtained from Hypsizygus marmoreus by alkali extraction and ethanol precipitation, and had an apparent molecular weight of 394 kDa. Its fine structure was investigated by FT-IR, methylation combined with GC-MS and 1D and 2D NMR analysis. Results indicated JHMP-70 was a branched beta-(1 6)-glucan substituted at O-3 by the non-reducing beta-Glcp and/or beta-(1 3)-linked beta-Glcp side chains at a ratio of 1:1. SEM observation revealed that there were micro-spherical shapes intertwined with randomly distributed fibrous filaments. Rheological measurements showed that its flow behavior was highly dependent on the concentration. Newtonian behavior was evident at low concentration, whereas pseudoplastic behavior was observed at high concentration. Besides, the addition of salt ions (Na + or Ca2+) significantly decreased the apparent viscosity of JHMP-70 solution. The low viscosity of JHMP-70 was probably attributed to its structural features, including main chain structure, branching degree and side chain length. This work can provide a basis theory to expand the application of the polysaccharides from H. marmoreus in food industry, because their lower viscosity and superior fluidity are desired in beverage products to impart stability against phase separation without compromising other sensorial properties.

Food Analytical Methods					A novel dispersive micro-solid-phase extraction (DMSPE) method is established for the determination of seven acaricides (clofentezine, benzomate, fenpyroximate, diafenthiuron, pyridaben, doramectin, and ivermectin) in fruit juice and functional food by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography. In this method, these analytes were extracted from apple juice and Curcuma wenyujin using cucurbituril used as the adsorbent, water as the extraction solvent, and methanol as the elution solvent. The primary parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized by experiments for concentration of adsorbent, oscillation time, desorption solvent, and pH value and by response surface methodology. Under the optimal conditions, all target analytes had a good linear relationship, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.9900 to 0.9940, the limits of detection were 0.42-5.16 ng/mL, the limits of quantification were 1.39-17.18 ng/mL, and the spiked recoveries of seven target compounds in real samples ranged from 70.04 to 94.95%. The intra-day precision RSD variations ranged from 0.13 to 0.70%, and the inter-day precision RSDs were between 0.38 and 1.4%, which had good reproducibility and repeatability. In general, DMSPE is a convenient, efficient, and environmentally friendly method for sample preparation, which has the potential for microextraction. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	15	5	1356	1367	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02209-8					FSTA:2023-01-Hq0611

Food Chemistry					The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is effective in reducing the fishy malodor of sea products. However, the biotransformation pathways are still unclear. The seaweed B. Fusco-purpurea was taken as an example to investigate the chemical transformation pathways for the deodorization process with S. cerevisiae fermentation. Sensory evaluation, GC-MS, GC-MS-O and odor activity value (OAV) analyses showed the fishy odorants were 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-nonenal, 2,4-decadienal, 2-pentylfuran, 2-octen-1-ol and nonanal. The removal of fishy malodor was related to the reactions of reduction, dehydrogenation, deformylation-oxygenation and ester syntheses via catalysis of aldehyde dehydrogenase, alcohol dehydrogenases, epoxide hydrolase, aldehyde deformylating-oxygenase, enone reductase, oxidases, dehydrogenases, aldo-keto reductases, ester synthase and acyltransferase. Interestingly, for the first time, it was found that 3,5-octadien-2-one transformed to 6-octen-2-one; and 2-pentylfuran transformed to o-cymene and hexyl acetate. Our findings enrich the knowledge for the removal of fishy malodor from sea products such as seaweeds.

J		Yu-Yan Zhu; Xiang-Chun Meng; Ying-Jun Zhou; Jian-Xiang Zhu; Ya-Ning Chang							Major royal jelly proteins alleviate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice model by regulating disordered metabolic pathways.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the major cause of global chronic hepatic injury, has obtained increasing attention while the current drug treatment still laid safety hazards. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs), the water-soluble proteins enriched in royal jelly (RJ), were applied to study its effects on improving NAFLD in the NAFLD mouse model. Herein, we demonstrated that intaking of 250-500mg/kg/day MRJPs significantly decreased the rate of obesity, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, and insulin resistance. Next, TOF to MRM ("TM") widely targeted metabolomics (untargeted metabolomics + widely targeted metabolomics) was further used to explore the potential mechanism, and we found that 500mg/kg MRJPs alleviated lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation mainly by regulating the metabolisms of alpha-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Moreover, by detecting multiple oxidative stress factors and inflammatory cytokines, we found that MRJPs indeed exerted antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Together, we demonstrated that MRJPs could mediate the progress of NAFLD through the "multi-component-multi-target-multi-pathway" mechanism, which could be considered as an ideal functional food in alleviating NAFLD. Practical applications. Royal jelly (RJ) is a bee product with high nutritional value. Major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs) are water-soluble proteins in RJ. Our research showed that MRJPs significantly ameliorated NAFLD induced by a high-fat diet in mice, suggesting that MRJPs could be used as an active ingredient to help improve NAFLD, which was beneficial for the development of related functional foods and the economic value of RJ. Moreover, the metabolic pathways involved in the ameliorative effect of MRJPs were investigated, which provided new ideas for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	9			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14214					FSTA:2023-01-Lg0032

Food Chemistry					Gut microbiota-involved metabolism and intestinal absorption affecting bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry and grape were investigated for the first time by coupling the in vitro digestion model with the Caco-2 cell model. Results showed that the gut microbiota decreased the bioaccessibility of triadimefon in strawberry by 31.00% but failed in grape, probably due to a negative modulation of the colon bacterial activity by dietary components in grapes. A strain of triadimefon-degrading bacteria, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, was isolated from the gut microbiota and its degradation products were profiled. This study also clarified a significant reduction in transepithelial transport (up to 32.81%) of triadimefon as a result of the barrier effect of gut microbiota. These findings provide new insights on the function of the gut microbiota in pesticide bioaccessibility and highlight the importance of including gut microbiota in pesticide residue risk assessments.

J		Yu-Yuan Hu; Chuan-Guo Ma; Tan-Ling Zhou; Ge Bai; Shu-Jing Guo; Xiao-Wei Chen							Enzymatic synthesis of hydrophilic phytosterol polyol esters and assessment of their bioaccessibility and uptake using an in vitro digestion/Caco-2 cell model.		Food Chemistry					A novel enzyme-catalyzed method was developed for the synthesis of phytosterol polyol esters from beta-sitosterol and polyols (sorbitol, mannitol and xylitol) by two-step transesterification using divinyl adipate (DVA) as a link. A high conversion (exceeding 94%) of beta-sitosterol with a vinyl group was achieved, in the presence of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL), at low temperature (35 °C) within 30 min. Subsequently, the maximum conversion of phytosterol polyol esters (>94%) was obtained using alkaline protease from Bacillus subtilis at 65 °C. Phytosterol polyol esters had enhanced thermal stability (up to an above 355 °C) and excellent water solubility (4.6-7.9 mM at 35 °C). Moreover, obvious increases in the bioaccessibility (41.5-63.6%) and intestinal uptake (5.2-6.5%) were observed using a simulated gastrointestinal digestion/Caco-2 cell model. These results highlighted the key role of hydrophilic structural modifications on physicochemical properties and absorption of phytosterols.

C.; Tao Zhou							Design and synthesis of novel stilbene-hydroxypyridinone hybrids as tyrosinase inhibitors and their application in the anti-browning of freshly-cut apples.		Food Chemistry					In order to develop the tyrosinase inhibitors with potential application in food industry, a series of stilbene-hydroxypyridinone hybrids were prepared. Among these compounds, 1h was found to possess the most potent tyrosinase inhibitory effect on both monophenolase and diphenolase activities, with IC50 values of 2.72muM and 15.86muM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of 1h on monophenolase activity was 4.6 times that of kojic acid. An inhibition kinetic assay indicated that 1h was a mixed-type and reversible inhibitor. The copper-binding and reducing ability assays, molecular docking study, intrinsic and ANS-binding fluorescence assays indicated that copper coordination and reduction is likely to be the causative mechanism for 1h-induced inhibition on tyrosinase. The results of color measurement and browning index determination indicated that treatment with 1h retarded effectively the browning of freshly-cut apples during their storage. Meanwhile, PPO and POD activities in apple slices were found to be effectively inhibited.

J		Yuan; Congcong Cui; Hui Liu; Xuenan Li; Yue Cao; Yan Zhang; Haiyang Yan							Effects of oxidation and hydrolysis of frying oil on MCPD esters formation in Chinese fried dough sticks.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, we investigated the influence of various factors on the formation of 2-monochloro-1,3-propanediol and 3-monochloro-1,2-propanediol (MCPD) esters in Chinese fried dough sticks. The results showed types of oil significantly affected the content of MCPD esters in fried dough sticks, with palm oil responsible for the highest. As well, temperature and time affected the content of MCPD esters (P< 0.05). Treatment at 200 °C for 4 min resulted in 1.87 mg/kg 3-MCPD esters and 0.68 mg/kg 2-MCPD esters, respectively. The dough containing 1 g/100 g NaCl was fried at 180 °C for 4 min, resulting in elevated levels of MCPD esters. MCPD esters in fried dough sticks constantly varied during the 8-h cycle in 3 consecutive days and the 12-h frying cycle. Pearson correlation test showed 3-MCPD esters had a positive correlation with 2-MCPD esters (R = 0.920), which allowed 3-MCPD esters to be a representative index of MCPD esters. A good correlation between the acid value (AV), p-anisidine value (p-AnV), color (DeltaEpsilon) of frying oil and MCPD esters in fried dough sticks was also found. The changes of MCPD esters of fried dough sticks were assumed to be caused by oxidation and hydrolysis of oil during frying.

J		Yuan Cao; Liyuan Zhao; Qilin Huang; Shanbai Xiong; Tao Yin; Zhiyu Liu							Water migration, ice crystal formation, and freeze-thaw stability of silver carp surimi as affected by inulin under different additive amounts and polymerization degrees.		Food Hydrocolloids					This work investigated the effects of inulin on the water migration, ice crystal formation, and freeze-thaw stability of surimi under different additive amounts and polymerization degrees (DP). All the three types of inulin were shown to restrict water fluidity in surimi in a DP and amount dependent manner, and 10% long-chain inulin (L-INU) had the most conspicuous restriction on water migration. Short-chain inulin (S-INU) and nature inulin (N-INU) not only showed a more prominent effect than L-INU on decreasing freezing temperature and preventing ice crystal growth under an amount-effect relationship, but also were detected to interact with proteins to facilitate their stabilization. Freeze-thaw stability tests demonstrated all the three types of inulin could significantly inhibit the deterioration of surimi quality. After several freeze-thaw cycles, 8% L-INU showed the most significant inhibitory effect on thawing water loss, superior to commercial cryoprotectant (CC) (sucrose plus sorbitol), while 8% S-INU and N-INU were comparable to CC and showed better performance than L-INU in terms of chrominance of surimi, breaking force and deformation, water holding capacity, texture properties and whiteness of surimi gel. Overall, 8% S-INU can better maintain the surimi gel properties and 8% L-INU can better restrain the thawing water loss. These results suggest the potential of inulin as a promising cryoprotectant candidate in the frozen surimi industry.

J		Yuan Chen; Zhisheng Zhang							Exploring public perceptions on alternative meat in China from social media data using transfer learning method.		Food Quality and Preference					The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances.

Food & Function					The homeostasis of circadian clock linked to bile acid (BA) metabolism and gut microbiota has profound benefits in maintaining the health status of the host. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevention and regulation of apple polyphenol extract (APE) on BA metabolism and gut microbiota by means of modulation of circadian rhythms in mice. Eighty male C57BL/6 mice were randomized into four groups: 24-hour ad libitum standard chow group (AC), ad libitum HFD group (AF), restricted 12 h daytime HFD feeding group (DF), and daytime HFD feeding with APE treatment group (DP). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over a 24 h period. The results showed that APE decreased body weight and induced daily rhythms of Cry1 and Roralpha in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) and Clock, Cry1 and Cry2 in the ileum in daytime HFD mice. APE significantly increased the expression of hepatic FXR at ZT0 and BSEP at ZT12 and inhibited the expression of ileac FXR at ZT12, reduced levels of fecal TBAs, secondary BAs, and unconjugated BAs at ZT0. Meanwhile, APE regulated the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, and increased the abundance of probiotics. Therefore, our work revealed that APE as a clock-regulating natural compound could modulate BA metabolism and gut microbiota and protect against circadian disruption in a clock-dependent manner. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	5	2805	2822	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04116a					FSTA:2022-06-Je7845

Journal of Functional Foods					To investigate the potential role of apple polyphenol extract (APE) in the prevention and alleviation of circadian rhythm disturbances, eighty male C57BL/6mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were randomized into four groups: 24 h ad libitum feeding (AL), 12 h restricted nighttime feeding (NF) or daytime feeding (DF), and daytime feeding with APE intragastric administration (DF-APE). Five weeks later, the mice were sacrificed at 6 h intervals over 24 h. Disrupted fluctuations in serum lipid profiles and hormones, along with desynchronization of circadian clock genes and metabolic genes were observed after daytime HFD feeding. However, APE treatment improved hepatic steatosis and recovered circadian rhythms of Cry1/2, and genes Acc and Hsl related to lipid synthesis and hydrolysis of cholesteryl esters, and Cyp7a1 in bile acid synthesis. In conclusion, the present study provides new evidence revealing that the circadian clock might be a novel target for APE to regulate metabolic homeostasis.

J		Yuan Fang; Jeyachchandran Visvalingam; Peipei Zhang; Xianqin Yang							Biofilm formation by Non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli in monocultures and co-cultures with meat processing surface bacteria.		Food Microbiology					This study investigated the impact of meat processing surface bacteria (MPB) on biofilm formation by non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and potential links between biofilm formation by STEC and biofilm-related genes in their genomes. Biofilm development by 50 MPB and 6 STEC strains in mono- and co-cultures was assessed by the crystal violet staining method, and their expression of curli and cellulose was determined using the Congo red agar method. Genes (n = 141) associated with biofilm formation in the STEC strains were profiled. Biofilm formation in general correlated with cellulose and curli expression in both mono- and co-cultures. Most MPB strains had antagonistic effects on the biofilm formation of the STEC strains. Of the genes investigated, 81% were common among the STEC strains and there seems to be a gene-redundancy in biofilm formation. The inability of the O26 strain to form biofilms could be due to mutations in the rpoS gene. Truncation in the mlrA gene in the O145 strain seems not affecting its biofilm formation alone or with MPB. The O45 strain, despite having the greatest number of biofilm-related genes, did not form measurable biofilms. Overall, biofilm formation of STEC was affected by curli-cellulose expression and companion strains.

Transduction of stx2a mediated by phage (Phi11-3088) from Escherichia coli O104:H4 in vitro and in situ during sprouting of mung beans.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Escherichia coli O104:H4 strain 11-3088 encoding Stx2a is epidemiologically related to the foodborne outbreak associated with sprouts in Germany, 2011. Sprouting provides suitable conditions for bacterial growth and may lead to transduction of non-pathogenic strains of E. coli with Stx phages. Although transduction of E. coli by Stx phages in food has been documented, data on the phages from E. coli O104:H4 is limited. This study determined the host range of the bacteriophage Phi11-3088 from E. coli O104:H4 using E. coli O104:H4 Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and demonstrated phage transduction during sprouting. The Phi11-3088Deltastx transduced 5/45 strains, including generic E. coli, pap-positive E. coli O103:H2, ETEC, and S. sonnei. The expression level of Phi11-3088Deltastx differed among lysogens upon induction. Of the 3 highly induced lysogens, the lytic cycle was induced in E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr and O103:H2 but not in S. sonnei. E. coli DH5alpha was the only strain susceptible to lytic infection by Phi11-3088Deltastx. To explore the effect of drying and rehydration during seed storage and sprouting on phage induction and transduction, mung beans inoculated with the phage donor E. coli O104:H4Deltastx2::gfp::ampr (8 log CFU/g) were dried, rehydrated, and incubated with the phage recipient E. coli DH5alpha (7 log CFU/g) for 96 h. Sprouted seeds harbored about 3 log CFU/g of putative lysogens that acquired ampicillin resistance. At the end of sprouting, 71 % of putative lysogens encoded gfp, confirming phage transduction. Overall, stx transfer by phages may increase the cell counts of STEC during sprouting by converting generic E. coli to STEC.

J		Yuan Fu; Liwen Wang; Guochuan Jiang; Lili Ren; Liyan Wang; Xuejun Liu							Anti-diabetic activity of polysaccharides from Auricularia cornea var. Li.		Foods					Auricularia cornea var. Li. polysaccharide (ACP) has many important biological activities and has potential application value in food engineering, pharmaceutical science, and health care. The results were as follows: the extraction rate of ACP was 28.18% 1.41% and the purity of ACP was 86.92% 2.80%. ACP contains mannitol 32.41%, glucuronic acid 6.96%, rhamnose 0.32%, glucose 42.35%, galactose 0.77%, xylose 16.83%, and fucose 0.36%, without galacturonic acid and arabinose. In addition, the results of an animal test of diabetes mellitus II (DM II) with ACP showed that the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and fasting blood glucose and water in the serum of mice with ACP were significantly lower than those in the model group; the serum SOD, hepatic glycogen, and insulin of mice added with ACP were significantly higher than those in the model group. More importantly, ACP had no significant adverse effects on organ index and liver and kidney tissue morphology in mice. These results suggest that ACP can be used as a potential functional food component for the prevention or treatment of diabetes. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					In this study, the ameliorative effect of water bamboo shoot (WBS) on acute alcoholism mice was investigated and potential biological compounds were explored. Results showed that extraction methods significantly affected the active substances contents and bioactivities of WBS. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that alkali extract (NE) obtained the highest score, therefore, it was selected for further analysis. Animal experiments showed that NE demonstrated ameliorative effects on acute alcoholism mice as evident by significantly elevated activities of dehydrogenase (alcohol dehydrogenase, acetaldehyde dehydrogenase) and antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase), whereas significantly reduced the levels of aminotransferase (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase) in serum. The potential bioactive activity compounds of NE were explored by UPLC-MS/MS and bioinformatics analysis. Butyl isobutyl phthalate vanillin, ferulic acid methyl ester might be the major compounds in NE on alleviating acute alcoholism. These results indicated that WBS possesses potential ameliorating effect on acute alcoholism.

After the administration of AL, ASTA (30 mg per kg body weight), or saline on normal or obese mice for 4 weeks, the body fat accumulation levels, hepatic lipid contents and hepatic fatty acid profiles were detected, and AL showed better anti-obesity properties than ASTA. In an acute feeding experiment, it was first observed that the astaxanthin concentration of AL was higher than that of ASTA in the blood and liver of obese mice. What's more, AL altered the microbial co-occurrence patterns in obese mice. Some gut microbial modules that were significantly correlated with obesity-related physiological parameters were identified. Overall, the improvement effect of AL on obesity is better than that of ASTA due to their higher oral absorbability and modulating effects on the gut microbiota, and we suggest AL as a more suitable astaxanthin product type for obese bodies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	6	3720	3731	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03185f					FSTA:2022-07-Aj11350
J		Yuan Gao; Lopez, R. A.; Ruili Liao; Xiaoou Liu							Public health shocks, learning and diet improvement.		Food Policy					Many governments aim to mitigate health risks by attacking nutritional failures. In this article, we exploit a unique natural experiment, the COVID-19 pandemic as an exogenous public health shock, to estimate the learning effects of intensive health information campaigns on nutrient intake during the pandemic. Using data from nearly-one million food purchases in China, our empirical findings strongly support the learning effect in explaining improvements in nutrient intake in the post-COVID-19 period. We conclude that when public health shocks occur, policy makers can boost relevant learning mechanisms by promoting information and education to improve individuals' awareness of preventive health behaviors of a more permanent nature, which can lead to health improvements in a society.

J		Yuan Gao; Leizi Jiao; Fu Jiao; Daming Dong							Non-intrusive prediction of fruit spoilage and storage time via detecting volatiles in sealed packaging using laser spectroscopy.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Monitoring fruit spoilage can effectively avoid waste and reduce economic losses. Recent studies have proved that the measurement of food volatile compounds is effective to detect food spoilage at its early stage. Indeed, some fast analytical methods have been developed to measure the volatiles released from food, such as proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry, gas-phase infrared spectroscopy, and E-nose. However, these methods can only be applied to measure volatiles in unsealed packages of food and are unable to detect volatiles that are sealed in containers or packages, which are the common situations in food storage and sales. Herein, we investigated a non-intrusive method for detecting food volatiles and monitoring fruit spoilage during storage. A laser directed incident radiation into the food package where it diffused through the box, and absorption spectra were generated. The fingerprint spectra of the molecules in food volatiles were used to determine the concentrations of the volatiles inside the food package. In the experiment, grape spoilage was monitored by measuring changes in oxygen concentration and we successfully predicted the beginning of grape spoilage on the seventh day. The root-mean-square errors of prediction for the storage times of grapes and strawberries were 0.4426 and 0.3079 days, respectively.

Food Chemistry					We used a risk-benefit model to evaluate the effects of different farming methods and consumption habits on dietary risk of Chinese mitten crab. In this study, we found that cadmium levels in the total edible parts and brown meat were 0.029-0.462 mg/kg and 0.017-1.694 mg/kg, respectively. Cadmium exposure experiment showed that brown meat was the main enrichment site of cadmium. Fatty acid test found that the EPA+ DHA content in total edible parts fed with formulated feed and iced trash fish was 19.64 3.62 mg/g and 28.72 2.30 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively, and that in brown meat was 27.66 5.16 mg/g and 40.15 3.50 mg/g (p> 0.05), respectively. According to the risk-benefit model analysis, the dietary risk of brown meat under the two breeding methods is relatively high, but the risk quotient is less than 1.

Food Chemistry					A more accurate HPLC-MS screening method combining functional enzyme assay and affinity ultrafiltration screening assay was developed and applied for the screening of natural product inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase from Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits. The enzyme assay was conducted to prescreen botanical extracts, in which maltose was used as the substrate and detection object. That showed the Cercis chinensis Bunge fruits demonstrated higher alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (IC50=11.941.23 mug/mL) than acarbose (IC50=44.034.37 mug/mL) (n=3, p< 0.05). Subsequently, twelve bioactive components targeting alpha-glucosidase were screened out and identified using affinity ultrafiltration coupled to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The known inhibitor, acarbose, was used as a positive control and competitive ligand to eliminate false positives. Moreover, bindings of the twelve components to the active site of alpha-glucosidase were investigated via molecular docking, which further confirmed the results of the screening assay.

Food Chemistry					The work aimed to prepare pea protein isolate-chitosan (PPI-CS) nanoparticles, fabricate PPI-CS nanoparticles stabilized Pickering emulsions (PPI-CS Pickering emulsions) and deliver EPA for digestion in vitro and in vivo. The nanoparticles were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and PPI-CS Pickering emulsions were characterized by physicochemical and rheological properties. The results showed that the size of PPI-CS nanoparticles was 194.220.45 nm. Rheological measurement showed that the PPI-CS Pickering emulsions possessed a gel-like network. EPA encapsulated Pickering emulsions (EPA-PE, phi=0.6) exhibited a high retention rate (93%) during storage and performed a lower release rate compared with EPA-PE (phi=0.4) in vitro digestion. The area under the curve of EPA concentration of EPA-PE group and EPA-emulsions (EPA-Em) group was 1.71 and 1.48, respectively. It demonstrated that PPI-CS Pickering emulsions provided the possibility to deliver EPA for digestive absorption.

Food & Function					An inclusion system of embedding ferulic acid into beta-cyclodextrin (FACD) with different host-guest stoichiometries was prepared by a co-precipitation method. Then, the physicochemical properties and release kinetics of the FACD were evaluated. The results of thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) proved the successful embedding of FA into the beta-cyclodextrin matrix. Four mathematical models were applied to adjust the ferulic acid release profile and identify preferential kinetics. The results of physicochemical properties confirmed the successful formation of the complexes. The loading capacity (LC) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of the inclusion complex (1:0.5) were 41.03.28 mg g-1 and 52.12.31%, respectively, which were significantly higher than other molar ratios. The release behaviour revealed that loaded FA molecules under various host-guest stoichiometries obey different release models. While lower host-guest stoichiometry (1:0.5) provided desirable EE, the moderate host-guest stoichiometry (1:1) exhibited faster release behaviour. The FACD inclusion complex could be a promising bioactive material for food preservation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1327	1335	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03080a					FSTA:2022-06-Aj8834

J		Yuan Li; Ruyue Dong; Lei Ma; Yilin Qian; Zunying Liu							Combined anti-biofilm enzymes strengthen the eradicate effect of Vibrio parahaemolyticus biofilm: mechanism on cpsA-J expression and application on different carriers.		Foods					Vibrio parahaemolyticus is a human foodborne pathogen, and it can form a mature biofilm on food and food contact surfaces to enhance their resistance to antibacterial agents. In this study, the effect of anti-biofilm enzymes (combined lipase, cellulase and proteinase K) on the inhibition and eradication of pathogen biofilm was evaluated. The biofilm content of V. parahaemolyticus showed the highest level at the incubation time of 24 h, and the combined enzymes significantly inhibited the biofilm's development. The biofilm's inhibition and eradication rate at an incubation time of 24 h was 89.7% and 66.9%, respectively. The confocal laser scanning microscopic images confirmed that the microcolonies' aggregation and the adhesion of biofilm were inhibited with the combined enzyme treatment. Furthermore, combined enzymes also decreased the concentration of exopolysaccharide (EPS) and disrupted the EPS matrix network, wherein the expression of the EPS-related gene, cpsA-J, was likewise suppressed. The combined enzymes showed an excellent inhibition effect of V. parahaemolyticus biofilm on different carriers, with the highest inhibition rate of 59.35% on nonrust steel plate. This study demonstrates that the combined enzyme of lipase, cellulase and proteinase K could be a novel candidate to overcome biofilm's problem of foodborne pathogens in the food industry. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of Food Science					Sous-vide cooking is a highly praised method used to cook muscle foods because of its desired effect of providing better sensory properties by maintaining texture. In this study, we further explored the effect of water on texture by revealing the mechanisms of moisture migration. Low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) showed that the nonflowing water in sous-vide cooking hairtail was 2.36 0.33% higher than that in traditional cooking. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to clarify the law of moisture migration induced by temperature, and the moisture migration of the sous-vide cooking hairtail was slower during the holding heating stage. The microstructure explained the change rules of the texture. The degree of change was consistent with the moisture migration level. Digitalizing analysis quantitatively verified the effect of sous-vide cooking on the hairtail microstructure. The low moisture migration rate of sous-vide cooking resulted in a less damaged microstructure of the hairtail, manifesting as a desirable texture. Practical Application. LF-NMR and MRI showed that sous-vide hairtails exhibited a lower moisture migration rate. The holding heating stage only slightly changed the microstructure of the hairtail. The digitalizing analysis confirmed the moisture migration mechanisms. Heat-induced protein denaturation was closely related to the water state. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	9	3953	3964	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16260					FSTA:2023-01-Rc0225

Food Chemistry					Maize mildew is a common phenomenon and it is essential to detect the mildew of a single maize kernel and prevent mildew from spreading around. In this study, a line-scanning Raman hyperspectral imaging system was applied to detect fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Raman spectra were extracted while textural features were obtained to depict the maize mildew. Three kinds of modeling algorithms were used to establish the quantitative model to determine the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel. Then competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) was used to optimize characteristic variables. The optimal detection model was established with variables selected from the combination of Raman spectra and textural variance feature by PLSR. Results indicated that it was feasible to detect the fungal spore quantity of a single maize kernel by Raman hyperspectral technique. The study provided an in-situ and nondestructive alternative to detect fungal spore quantity.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					Mildewed maize kernels were common in nature and they were harmful to humans and livestocks. Therefore, it is essential to screen the mildewed maize kernels and improve food security. In this study, Raman hyperspectral imaging technique was used to screen the mildewed maize kernels. Hyperspectral imaging of both embryo-up and embryo-down side were taken into consideration and the effect of their weight ratio on the screening accuracy was compared. Pixel-wise approach and object-wise approach were both analyzed and different variables selection methods were applied to optimize the input variables. Six machine learning classifiers including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), extreme learning machine (ELM), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA), and naive Bayes classifier (NBC) were used to establish the screening models. The results exhibited 19 variables selected by competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) method from the weight ratio of 3:7 based on object-wise approach were the most suitable for establishment of screening model with accuracy of 90.63% in the testing set. The microscopic mechanism of mildewed maize kernels was illustrated by micro-fluorescence imaging. The study showed that Raman hyperspectral imaging combined with both embryo-up and embryo-down sides of maize kernels could be used as effective methods to improve the accuracy of screening mildewed maize kernels. Practical Applications. This study provides a comprehensive analysis about the pixels and both sides of maize kernels and gives a nondestructive screening method based on both sides of maize kernels for the mildewed detection. According the mildew of maize kernels, enterprises can effectively improve the storage efficiency of maize kernels to reduce economic losses. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.14148					FSTA:2023-02-Mc1321

Foods					Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ameliorating effects of three yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae I4, Clavispora lusitaniae 30 and Pichia kudriavzevii 11, isolated from traditional fermented dairy food in Xinjiang, China, on the ulcerative colitis symptoms of Balb/c mice treated by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Among which, S. cerevisiae I4 had good tolerance to simulated gastrointestinal juice and strong adhesion to HT-29 cells monolayers. Furthermore, the three yeast strains were oral administered to Balb/c mice with DSS induced colitis. The weight loss, colon shortening and histological injury of colitis mice were ameliorated. Then, oral administration of S. cerevisiae I4 improved the immune state by reducing the contents of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta and increasing immunoglobulin. The relative expression of intestinal barrier proteins Claudin-1, Occludin and Zonula Occludins-1 (ZO-1) of the mice enhanced, and the short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) content such as Propionic acid, Butyric acid, Isobutyric acid and Isovaleric acid in the feces of the mice increased to varying degrees, after S. cerevisiae I4 treatment compared with the model group of drinking 3% DSS water without yeast treatment. Moreover, S. cerevisiae I4 treatment lifted the proportion of beneficial bacteria such asMuribaculaceae, Lactobacillaceae and Rikenellaceae in the intestinal tract of the mice, the abundance of harmful bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Turicibacter was decreased. These results suggested that S. cerevisiae I4 could alleviate DSS induced colitis in mice by enhancing intestinal barrier function and regulating intestinal flora balance. © 2022 by the authors.

International Food Research Journal					A hyperspectral imaging system covering 400-1000 nm spectral range was applied for vigour detection of waxy maize seeds after artificial aging. After spectral pre-processing, the characteristic wavelength was selected by uninformative variable elimination (UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), and random frog (RF) methods. The moisture, starch, protein, and fat contents were measured for each grade of seed, and these values were correlated with the spectrum. Finally, the vitality detection model was established by least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), extreme learning machine (ELM), and random forest (RF). The prediction sets exhibited high classification accuracy (> 99%) for 115 features. The model constructed from the bands significantly correlated with chemical composition (CC), and was better than the classic feature selection methods. The overall results indicated that hyperspectral imaging could be a potential technique to assess seed vigour.										2022	29	2	397	405	1985-4668									FSTA:2022-09-Mc5305

Food Chemistry					Identifying geographical origins of red wines made in specific regions is of significance since the false claim of geographical origins has been frequently exposed in China's wine industry. In this work, an untargeted metabolomic approach based on UPLC-QTOF-MS was established to discriminate geographical origins of Chinese red wines. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed significant differences between wine samples from three famous geographical origins in China. The metabolites contributing to the differentiation were screened by orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) with pairwise modeling. 40 and 46 differential metabolites in positive and negative ionization modes were putatively identified as chemical markers. Furthermore, heatmap visualization and OPLS-DA models were constructed based on these identified markers and external verification wine samples from different regions were successfully discriminated, with recognition rate up to 96.7%. This study indicated that UPLC-QTOF-MS-based untargeted metabolomics has great potential for the geographical origin traceability of Chinese red wines.

J		Yuan Su; Xiaoye Shen; To Chiu; Tonia Green; Mei-Jun Zhu							Efficacy of chlorine and peroxyacetic acid to control Listeria monocytogenes on apples in simulated dump tank water system.		Food Microbiology					Chlorine and peroxyacetic acid (PAA) are commonly applied in dump tanks and flume systems in commercial fresh apple packing lines; however, little is known about their practical efficacies in dump tank water systems. This study evaluated the efficacies of chlorine and PAA to control Listeria monocytogenes on fresh apples and cross-contamination in simulated dump tank water (SDTW). Efficacies of chlorinated water with initial free chlorine (FC) of 25-100 ppm against L. monocytogenes on apples were significantly impacted by the presence of organic matter, especially for chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC. Chlorine with initial FCs of 50-100 ppm and 2 min contact reduced L. monocytogenes on apples by ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple in SDTW with 1000 ppm chemical oxygen demand (COD). However, 2-5 min wash of chlorine with 25 ppm initial FC only led to ~0.3 log10 CFU/apple reduction of L. monocytogenes on apples in SDTW compared to ~0.9 log10 CFU/apple reduction in clean water. The impacts of organic matter on the antimicrobial efficacy of PAA are concentration dependent. At 20-80 ppm and tested contact times (2-5min), efficacies of PAA against L. monocytogenes were not influenced by organic matter presented in SDTW; 2-5min wash with PAA 80 ppm caused 1.7-1.8 log10 CFU/apple log reduction. However, the anti-Listeria efficacy of 10 ppm PAA was significantly lower in SDTW than in clean water. Sanitizers at the tested concentrations reduced L. monocytogenes transferred from contaminated apples to uncontaminated apples and SDTW but did not eliminate it. There were 1.7-0.6 and 1.0-0.9 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes transferred to uninoculated apples in SDTW treated with 50-100 ppm FC and 60-80 ppm PAA, respectively, for 2 min, while 3.6-3.7 log10 CFU/apple of L. monocytogenes were transferred to uncontaminated apples in SDTW without any sanitizer treatments. Data indicated that sanitizer treatments in SDTW are effective but can be further improved to ensure the microbial safety of apples.

J		Yuan, T. Z.; Yongfeng Ai							Pasting and gelation behaviors and in vitro digestibility of high-amylose maize starch blended with wheat or potato starch evaluated at different heating temperatures.		Food Hydrocolloids					Different approaches have been adopted to overcome the inherent shortcomings of native starches, and blending of different native starches has attracted much attention due to the "clean-label" feature and the low processing effort and cost. In the current study, we blended high-amylose maize starch (HA7) with wheat (WHE) or potato (POT) starch at 1:1 ratio (dry weight basis; dwb) and then comprehensively examined their thermal properties, pasting and gelling behaviors over the heating temperature range of 95-140°C, and in vitro digestibility in comparison with three individual starches. With an excess amount of water (starch: water = 1:3), gelatinization of individual starches generally appeared to be independent in the two starch blends. An exceptionally low percentage of retrogradation was observed for gelatinized HA7-WHE blend during cold storage, which could be partially ascribed to the formation of a large amount of amylose-lipid complexes (ALC). Greater resistance to thermal degradation and thixotropic breakdown during pasting at 120°C was found with HA7-WHE blend when compared with HA7-POT blend. Both starch blends could form gels with moderate strength (74.3-109.4g) after cooking at 120 and 140°C. The determined resistant starch (RS) and slowly digestible starch (SDS) contents of water-boiled HA7-WHE blend were higher than the calculated values when assuming simple additivity of the two starches. The interactions at both granular and molecular levels and the presence of ALC were responsible for the reported unique techno-functional attributes of HA7-WHE blend, which rendered it suitable for diverse food and industrial applications.

J		Yuan Tao; Bowen Yan; Nana Zhang; Mingfu Wang; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Daming Fan							Do non-thermal effects exist in microwave heating of glucose aqueous solutions? Evidence from molecular dynamics simulations.		Food Chemistry					The existence of microwave non-thermal effects in food processing is still debated. In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the conformation, electrostatic profiles, and intramolecular hydrogen bonds (intra-HB) of glucose in aqueous solution under alternating electric fields of microwaves ranging from 0 to 109 V/m at 2.45 GHz. The results showed a field-induced threshold of 109 V/m. At the threshold, alternating microwaves reoriented the flexible moieties and thus enhanced the intra-HB. The conformational transition among gg, gt, and tg conformers at 109 V/m possibly resulted from the uneven electrostatic potential and the increased intra-HB. In practice, the maximum electric field of microwaves is several times weaker than the threshold, verifying the absence of microwave non-thermal effects for glucose molecules in food processing. This study provides a novel strategy to evaluate the potential non-thermal effects of microwaves in food processing and the related underlying food safety issues.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Clostridium perfringens is a well-known pathogen that causes foodborne disease. With a high prevalence of contamination in food, an efficient strategy is needed to decontaminate those contaminated foods and control the emergence of foodborne disease. In this study, the C. perfringens-specific lytic phage vB_CpeP_HN02 (designated as phage HN02) was isolated from chicken feces. Electron microscopy and phylogenetic analysis suggested that phage vB_CpeP_HN02 is a novel phage of the family Podoviridae. Phage HN02 had good pH (5-11) and temperature tolerance (< 70 °C). Phage HN02 exhibited a broad host range of C. perfringens isolates (42.86%). The complete genome of the phage HN02 was sequenced and revealed a linear double-stranded DNA genome. The 17,754-bp genome (GenBank MW815121) with average GC content of 28.2% includes 22 predicted open reading frames, of which only 10 were annotated with known functions. Phylogenetic analysis of the available C. perfringens phage major capsid protein demonstrated that phage HN02 is closely related to virulent C. perfringens phage phi24R and CPD2. When phage HN02 was applied to chicken meat samples stored at 4 °C for 72 h with 1*106 to 1*109 PFU/g, 95% to 99% of C. perfringens were inactivated on chicken meat surfaces after storage at 4 °C for 72 h, respectively. It should be noted that C. perfringens could be completely lysed by a high dose of phage HN02 (1*1010 PFU/g) after 48 h treatment in chicken samples. Through the lytic activity testing, phage HN02 showed good antimicrobial effects, and can be used as an antibacterial agent for biocontrol of C. perfringens in meat products.

Food Research International					Listeria monocytogenes is a gram-positive pathogen, that usually adheres to stainless steel (SS), and other abiotic surfaces in food processing that undergo repeated cleaning and cause the spread of Listeria. Through the enumeration of biofilm cells, extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) component and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of biofilms, it was found that the ratio of cells and extracellular matrix is affected by nutrition status. Regardless of the temperature, all strains exhibited a higher adhesion ability when exposed to 10-fold diluted TSB-YE (DTSB-YE, nutrition deficiency). Three hour initial adhesion was significantly positively correlated with biofilm formation (p<0.01). DTSB-YE enhances initial attachment and subsequently promotes biofilm formation. The SEM analysis also showed that in DTSB-YE the adhesion and covered area of the attached cells were higher than those in TSB-YE (rich media). The amount of both extracellular polysaccharides and proteins was significantly higher when incubated in DTSB-YE than TSB-YE. The highest biofilm formation of Lm83 was observed in DTSBYE independent of temperature. The effects of nutrition deficiency on the expression of critical biofilm-associated genes of Lm 83 planktonic and biofilm cells were measured. The gene expression levels of inlA and sigB in biofilm cells in TSB-YE and DTSB-YE were approximately 95.7% and 88.0% and 42.2% and 45.7% lower than those in planktonic cells, respectively. However, the expression of inlA in DTSB-YE was significantly higher (p<0.05) than that in TSB-YE for the same cell state. Interestingly, the gene expression of motB was considerably higher in DTSB-YE than in TSBYE, regardless of the state. These results indicate that better cell motility in nutrient deficiencies might facilitate the cell aggression to promote biofilm formation.

Varshney; Xiaoping Chen							Impact of different cooking methods on the chemical profile of high-oleic acid peanut seeds.		Food Chemistry					High oleic acid (OA) peanut seeds (PS) can be beneficial for human health. However, chemical variations in high-OA PS after domestic cooking are not fully understood. In order to investigate the impact of different cooking methods on the chemical profile of high-OA PS, widely established metabolomics approach was employed to identify the relative contents of PS metabolites. Herein, 630 metabolites within 27 categories were characterized in PS, of which 141, 157, 402 differential metabolites were observed in each treatment group (boiling, baking, and frying) when compared to the raw seed. Accordingly, bioactive substances were maximally preserved in baked high-OA PS. Further conventional methods (HPLC-UV/GC-MS) quantified the absolute composition of amino and fatty acids, verifying the reliability of metabolomic analysis. Collectively, the understanding of the phytochemical substances in relation to the domestic cooking method established a foundation for future high-OA PS processing.

Varshney; Xuanqiang Liang; Yanbin Hong; Xiaoping Chen							Lipid profile variations in high olecic acid peanuts by following different cooking processes.		Food Research International					High oleic acid (OA) peanut seed (PS), contains a higher ratio of oleic acid (C18:1) compared to general PS, which is favored by consumers due to its health benefits. However, comprehensive lipid metabolite profiles of high-OA PS, once they have been processed via domestic cooking methods, have never been produced. To establish a scientific guide for the selection of the most appropriate processing method for high-OA PS, lipidomics was performed to identify 706 lipid metabolites in high-OA PS following boiling, baking and frying, between the three groups, 75, 175 and 242 lipid metabolites were differentially expressed respectively. Additionally, 46glycerolipids with C18:1molecular were observed in the lipid profiles of the treatment groups compared to the raw sample. Further evaluation of seven lipid peroxides and six antioxidant status of each testing group suggested that boiled PS retained the highest levels of lipids and antioxidant activity. Following these findings, boiling appears to be an appropriate processing method when attempting to conserve the beneficial substances found in the PS. Finally, the levels of major free fatty acids present in high-OA PS, were jointly quantified by conventional methods (GC-MS) and lipidomic analysis. FA/C16:0 levels were similar, FA/C18:0, FA/C18:1 displayed opposite results, FA/C18:2 levels increased following frying and FA/C18:3 levels were down regulated once the PS was boiled. This indicates that GC-MS is a potential method of validation for the results of lipidomic analysis. Conclusively, this in depth understanding of lipid content in relation to domestic cooking methods has provided a foundation for the processing of high-OA peanut products.

J		Yuan Xiao; Rui Shi; Jian Zhang; Lianfu Zhang							Evaluation of endogenous enzyme-induced chemical transformations of flavonoid glycosides to aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside in different Tartary buckwheat edible tissues.		Journal of Cereal Science					Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum, TB) is rich in flavonoid glycosides, which are transformed into aglycones and ethyl-beta-rutinoside by endogenous rutin-degrading enzymes. However, the enzymatic reaction efficacy has only been assessed in TB seeds, whilst comprehensive information regarding the catalytic capabilities of other edible tissues is limited. Herein, based on an improved UPLC-MS/MS method, aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside, which are generated from enzyme-induced transglycosylation and hydrolysis reactions, were investigated under different enzymatic treatment parameters in a model reaction system. Subsequently, with previously optimized enzymatic parameters (temperature, 40 °C; ethanol concentration, 20%; reaction time, 30 min), the enzymatic catalysis potency was evaluated in different tissues of TB. After enzymatic treatment, the highest yields of ethyl-rutinoside (20.59 mg/g) and aglycones (10.84 mg/g) were observed in the bran of TB. Moreover, the powder of different TB tissues was utilized to produce bread, and bread with TB bran also exhibited the highest levels of aglycones (3.41 mg/g) and ethyl-rutinoside (1.75 mg/g). These results provide good evidence for the optimal utilization of TB bran for the enrichment of foods with ethyl-rutinoside and aglycones for potential health benefits.

J		Yuan Xiao; Jian Zhang; Lianfu Zhang							Effect of superfine grinding on physicochemical properties and endogenous enzyme induced flavonoid transformations of Tartary buckwheat bran.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Tartary buckwheat (TB) bran contains endogenous rutin-degrading enzyme (RDE), which can convert flavonoid glycosides into aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside with potential health benefits. However, the large particle size of TB bran limits its application in food industry. The present study aims to combine micronization and endogenous RDE catalysis for the treatment of TB bran. Here, four TB bran samples, with distinct D50 values (the equivalent volume diameters at 50% cumulative volume) of 359, 239, 168 and 42mum, were prepared by superfine grinding; their physical properties were evaluated. Additionally, with RDE catalysis, the phytochemical compounds, antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the four bran samples were investigated. Compared to the unprocessed material, TB bran (D50, 42mum) exhibited the highest amount of aglycones and ethyl-rutinoside after RDE catalysis, with the total content increased from 1mg/g to 35mg/g. Importantly, after superfine grinding and RDE catalysis, the antioxidant and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of TB bran significantly increased. Theoretically, molecular docking verified that the increased aglycone (quercetin), generated after RDE catalysis, is the predominant alpha-glucosidase inhibitor. Accordingly, the combination of superfine grinding and RDE catalysis is a feasible technology for developing high value-added TB bran products.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Profile of phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of proso millets were studied. Twelve phenolic derivatives were identified in the free extract, including N′-caffeoyl-N-feruloylspermidine, N′, N-dicaffeoylspermidine and N-(p-coumaroyl) serotonin reported for the first time in proso millets. Fifteen phenolic acid derivatives were found in the bound fraction with p-coumaric acid and ferulic acid being the major phenolic acids, as well as four ferulic acid dimers (DFAs) detected for the first time in proso millets. The total phenolic content (TPC) of the soluble and insoluble phenolic fractions varied from 592 to 1510 mg ferulic acid equivalents (FAE)/kg dry weight (DW) and 1146-2436 mg FAE/kg DW, respectively. The total flavonoid content (TFC) of the proso millets ranged from 284 to 978 mg rutin equivalents (RE)/kg DW. DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays were applied to determine in vitro antioxidant activities for all the phenolic extracts, and the antioxidant levels were attributed to TPCs. The diverse phenolics contributed to the antioxidant properties of proso millet, which can serve as viable functional food ingredients. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Chronic stress causes duodenal damage, in which iron death is likely to play an important role. Chlorogenic acid (CGA), one of the most widely consumed dietary polyphenols, has been shown to protect the intestine. However, it is unclear whether CGA exerts a duodenoprotective effect in chronic stress by inhibiting ferroptosis. In this work, rats were daily exposed to restraint stress for 6 h over 21 consecutive days, with/without CGA (100mg/kg, gavage). CGA reduced blood hepcidin, iron, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and ferroportin 1 (FPN1) levels and upregulated the levels of ferroptosis-related biomarkers (GPX4, GSH, NADPH, etc.). These results confirmed that CGA inhibited ferroptosis in the duodenum. Furthermore, the use of S3I-201 (STAT3 inhibitor) helped to further clarify the mechanism of action of CGA. Overall, CGA could reduce hepcidin production by inhibiting the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway in the liver to increase the expression of FPN1 in the duodenum, which restored iron homeostasis and inhibited ferroptosis, alleviating chronic stress-induced duodenal injury.										2022	70	14	4353	4361	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01196					FSTA:2022-08-Aj13853

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Curcumin is a bioactive supplement known to have many medical benefits. However, it has low bioavailability due to its insolubility in aqueous solution and rapid degradation profile. In this paper, an oil-in-water (O/W) Pickering emulsion (PE) was fabricated ultrasonically with different cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) concentrations to investigate its effect on the physicochemical properties of PE and the storage stability of curcumin. The CNC-PE produced remained stable for at least one month. The highest encapsulation efficiency of curcumin in CNC-PE was found to exceed 99%. For storage of curcumin containing CNC-PE under dark conditions, good stability of curcumin was observed with a half-life of 98.47 d, reflecting a nearly 20-fold improvement as compared to other existing PE systems. On the other hand, storage under visible light, UV light, and at elevated temperature (50°C) increased the degradation rate of encapsulated curcumin following the order: 50°C > UV light > visible light > dark. Our findings elucidated the promising potential of CNC-PE as a food-safe delivery system for sensitive lipophilic bioactive compounds.

C.; Ximing Xu							Improved intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability of astaxanthin using poly (ethylene glycol)-graft-chitosan nanoparticles: preparation, in vitro evaluation, and pharmacokinetics in rats.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Astaxanthin (ASTA) is a kind of food-derived active ingredient (FDAI) with antioxidant and antidiabetic functions. It is nontoxic but its poor solubility and low bioavailability hinder its application in the food industry. In this study, a novel carrier, polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan (PEG-g-CS) was applied to enhance the bioavailability of astaxanthin. It encapsulated astaxanthin completely by solvent evaporation to manufacture astaxanthin using poly (ethylene glycol)-graft-chitosan nanoparticles (ASTA-PEG-g-CS) nanoparticles to improve absorption. Results. The ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles were spherical, with a particle size below 200nm and a zeta potential of about-26mV. Polyethylene glycol-grafted chitosan can encapsulate astaxanthin well, and the encapsulated astaxanthin was released rapidly-in 15min in an in vitro release study. In a rat single-pass intestinal perfusion study, a low concentration of ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticle (0.2 mugmL-1) was better absorbed in the intestine. In particular, the jejunum could absorb most astaxanthin without a change in the concentration. An in vivo release study also demonstrated that ASTA-PEG-g-CS nanoparticles enhanced oral bioavailability significantly. Conclusion. This novel carrier, PEG-g-CS, provided a simple way to encapsulate food, which improved the bioavailability of hydrophobic ingredients. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	3	1002	1011	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11435					FSTA:2022-04-Aj7163

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Frozen cooked noodles (FCNs) were prepared with different levels (0,1%, 3% and 5%) of gluten addition, and the effect of gluten on quality of FCNs was investigated. Cooking properties analysis showed that water absorption ratio and cooking loss of FCNs decreased at first and then increased with the increase of gluten addition. Compared to FCNs with 1% and 5% gluten additions, recooked FCNs with 3% gluten addition had a similar texture property to control sample, and they had the highest tensile force and distance, and the lowest surface tackiness. Meanwhile, the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had smaller pores, denser and more complex gluten network, and their force and elasticity during chewing were the best in sensory evaluation. Low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance showed that the lowest T21 (0.11ms) and T23 (51.11ms) were found in the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition). Furthermore, the alpha-helix of samples increased while the beta-sheet and random coil decreased, the glutenin macropolymer content of recooked FCNs increased at first and then decreased with adding gluten. These results indicated that the recooked FCNs (3% gluten addition) had a lower surface tackiness, higher sensory scores, and better quality.

Food & Function					Panax notoginseng has been used both as a traditional medicine and as a functional food for hundreds of years in Asia. However, the active constituents from P. notoginseng and their pharmacologic properties still need to be further explored. In this study, one new dammarane-type triterpenoid saponin (1), along with fourteen known analogs (2-15) were isolated and identified from the roots of P. notoginseng. The anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenetic and anti-dengue virus effects of these isolated compounds were further evaluated. Compounds 1, 3, 5-7 and 10-12 exerted anti-inflammatory effects in two different zebrafish inflammatory models. Among them, 11, with the most significant activities, alleviated the inflammatory response by blocking the MyD88/NF-kappaB and STAT3 pathways. Moreover, compound 15 showed anti-angiogenetic activities in Tg (fli1:EGFP) and Tg (flk1:GFP) zebrafish, while 3 and 5 only inhibited angiogenesis in Tg (fli1:EGFP) zebrafish. Additionally, compounds 1, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 12 suppressed the replication of Dengue virus either at the viral adsorption and entry stages or at the intracellular replication step. In conclusion, these findings enrich knowledge of the diversity of saponins in P. notoginseng and suggest that the dammarane-type triterpenoid saponins from P. notoginseng may be developed as potential functional foods to treat inflammation, angiogenesis or dengue-related diseases. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	6	3590	3602	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04089h					FSTA:2022-07-Ge3104

Merr starch (APS) with different degrees of substitution (DS [0, 0.02, 0.24, 0.40]) and evaluate in vitro digestibility, pasting, and thermal properties of citrate APS. The citrate APS surface become rougher. Citric acid modification led to significant changes in molecular and crystal structure citric acid treatment significantly reduced molecular weight of APS, and the molecular weight was decreased with increasing the DS. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and a higher resistant starch (RS) content. RS content of APS citrate was increased with increasing the DS, and the maximum RS content reached 74.21%. Citric acid modification improved thermal stability of the APS. These results suggested that the structural alterations might be responsible for changes of APS citrate properties and the citrate APS was an excellent potential food additive that had desirable functional properties and high RS content. Novelty impact statement. The non-conventional APS was modified using citric acid. The citrate APS possessed a lower pasting viscosity and had a higher RS content, up to 74.21%.

Food Research International					Sichuan pickle is a natural combination of probiotics and dietary fibers, in which a strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum QS7T was found to be capable of efficiently metabolizing inulin. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of inulin consumption by the strain QS7T is unclear. Therefore, this study firstly investigated the metabolic characteristics of inulin in the strain QS7T, and the results showed it could grow very well on the medium containing inulin as a carbon source (maximum OD600 nm, 1.891 0.028) and degrade both short-chain oligofructose and long-chain fructan components through thin layer chromatography analysis. Genomic sequencing and analysis revealed a high percentage of functional genes associated with carbohydrate transport and metabolism, particularly glycoside hydrolase (GH) genes responsible for hydrolysing carbohydrates, within the genome of the strain QS7T. Furthermore, comparative transcriptomic analysis of L. plantarum QS7T in response to inulin or glucose indicated that functional genes associated with inulin consumption including several genes encoding PTS sugar transporters and two predicted GH32 family genes encoding beta-fructofuranosidase and beta-fructosidase were significantly up-regulated by inulin compared to the gene expression on glucose. In conclusion, we obtained a mechanistic understanding of interplay between probiotic L. plantarum QS7T derived from Sichuan pickle and natural dietary fiber, inulin; totally two operons including a sacPTS1 operon responsible for metabolizing short-chain oligofructose primarily in the cytoplasm and a fos operon responsible for extracellularly degrading all moderate and long-chain fructan components linked to inulin consumption by L. plantarum QS7T.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					Jujubes (Ziziphus Mauritiana Lamk) are subjected to bruises during harvesting and post-harvest processing, which will greatly reduce their commercial values. In this study, bruises on jujube are detected and classified based on thermal imaging and convolutional neural networks. A simple thermal imaging system is constructed that can capture thermal images speedily and clearly. Temperature difference analysis is performed on the collected thermal images and accordingly, the temperature difference of boundary in the bruised area varies between 1.72 and 3.25 °C during the storage period. The temperature difference in the bruise boundary area minus the temperature difference in the center area varies between 0.4 and 1.2 °C, and the degree of bruise of the jujube is evaluated through temperature difference analysis. The convolutional neural network DenseNet is adjusted to ensure suitability for classification of the thermal image data set collected in this study (the training dataset comprises 5,039 original thermal images, and the test dataset comprises 2,586 original thermal images), and the best prediction accuracy achieved is 99.5%. Practical Application. This study can be used as a reference for the future development of harvest, sorting, storage, and transportation for bruise detection in jujube.

Exploring the contribution of (poly)phenols to the dietary exposome using high resolution mass spectrometry untargeted metabolomics.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. This study presents a workflow to construct a Dietary Exposome Library (DEL) comprised of phytochemicals and their metabolites derived from host and gut microbiome metabolism for use in peak identification/annotation of untargeted metabolomics datasets. Methods and Results. An evidence mapping initiative established target analytes related to the consumption of phytochemical-rich foods. Analytes were confirmed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS (n)) analysis of human biospecimens from dietary intervention studies of (poly) phenol-rich diets. One hundred and sixty six verified compounds were subsequently analyzed on an untargeted metabolomics platform to acquire chromatographic and high-resolution mass spectral data for construction of a DEL. The DEL facilitated identification/annotation of 123metabolites associate with exposure to (poly) phenol enriched diets, which included aromatic ketones, benzoic acids, ellagic acids, caffeoylquinic acids, catecholamines, coumarins, hippuric acid, hydroxytoluenes, phenylamines, stilbenes, urolithins, valerolactones, and xanthonoids, in untargeted metabolomics datasets acquire from human plasma and urine reference materials. Conclusions. The DEL focusing on (poly) phenols and their metabolites of dietary exposure facilitated identification/annotation of ingested food components and their associated pathways in untargeted metabolomics datasets acquired from human biospecimens.

Food Chemistry					Terpenoid metabolism at different developmental stages of Carya cathayensis was elucidated based on LC-MS/MS analysis and multi-omics. Terpenoid metabolites 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphoquinone and 3-hydroxybenzoic acid reached the maximum at 105 days after pollination (DAP) (P2 stage). To reveal the complex mechanism of C. cathayensis embryogenesis in relation to terpenoid metabolites (90-165 DAP), a metabolomic and transcriptional co-expression analysis was conducted. Based on RNA-Seq analysis, 679 genes of 1144 terpenoid biosynthesis were differentially expressed. Six terpenoid metabolites and 86 differentially expressed genes related to terpenoquinone metabolism were identified. Comprehensive analysis of metabolome and transcriptional data revealed that terpenoquinone accumulated in the early phase was active in the later phase. Overall, we profiled the transcriptome and metabolome changes in C. cathayensis during the developmental phase to investigate the metabolic pathways and candidate genes underlying the changes at different growth stages.

Journal of Food Science					With the increasing progress of society and in-depth scientific research, dietary regulations, especially sustained glucose releases, are regarded as an effective and significant way to lighten or even cut the emergence of diabetes. In this research, the starch-lipid complex gelatinized potato starch-glycerol monostearate dimer (GPS-GMS-D) was developed to provide a low-glycemic index functional food component for type 2 diabetes. Briefly, the higher complexation index (CI, 71.02%), lower rapidly digestible starch (RDS, 35.57%), and lower estimated glycemic index (eGI, 52.34%) were referred to as GPS-GMS-D. It was assumed that the solid V-type crystal structure, induced with the helix between GMS-D and GPS due to high amylose, high saturation, and low steric hindrance, contributed to the lower digestibility. In addition, baking treatment for 5min was systematically exerted to improve the flavor of GPS-GMS-D with a relatively high CI (59.98%) and low eGI (54.15%). It was believed that rapid dehydration and close interaction during baking treatment could slow down the decomposition of GPS-GMS-D and conversions of starch fractions. Therefore, these results suggested that the as-developed GPS-GMS-D was a promising low GI functional dietary food component for diabetes mellitus, and a suitable baking post-thermal treatment was successfully proposed to enhance the flavor of GPS-GMS-D. Practical Application. The higher amylose and solid V-type crystal structure in gelatinized potato starch-glycerol monostearate dimer (GPS-GMS-D) would induce the formation of slowly digestive starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) to suppress enzymatic hydrolysis. Moreover, the flavor of GPS-GMS-D was enhanced with appropriate and moderate thermal processing (baking), which was likely to improve the quality of life of a person with diabetes. Thus, we believe that GPS-GMS-D is a promising functional food component for diabetes mellitus. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	8	3447	3458	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16244					FSTA:2022-12-Le2039

Food Chemistry					The global annual fruit and vegetable waste accounts for more than half of food waste, and the main cause of this waste is the deterioration of fruit and vegetable. In addition, fruit spoilage can produce foodborne illnesses and pose a public health threat. In order to guarantee the quality and safety of fruits in the fruit supply chain. We prepared multifunctional silver based metal-organic frameworks@carboxymethyl filter paper (Ag-MOFs@CMFP) composite paper by in situ synthesis. The composite paper used in fruit packaging can effectively slows down fruit deterioration. Besides, Ag-MOFs@CMFP composite paper can reflect the quality of the fruit by detecting changes in humidity, which has yet to be reported elsewhere. Significantly, transmitting the humidity response signal to the mobile phone can realize remote real-time wireless monitoring of fruit quality. This work may contribute to achieve the integration of real-time wireless monitoring, preservation and packaging for fruit-supply chain.

Journal of Food Science					To explore a fast, simple, and accurate method to identify adulteration in flaxseed oil, the Raman spectral data of 130 samples containing flaxseed, canola, cottonseed, and adulterated oils were obtained using a portable fiber optic Raman spectrometer. The Raman spectral results showed that the Raman spectra of the flaxseed and canola oils had noticeable peak shifts, whereas the peak positions of the flaxseed and cottonseed oils were relatively similar. Clear peak intensity differences were observed in the flaxseed, cottonseed, and canola oils, mainly at 868cm-1, 1022cm-1, 1265cm-1, and 1655cm-1, with Raman shift intensities in the following order: Iflaxseed oil> Icottonseed oil> Icanola oil. Similarly, the peak intensity of the flaxseed and adulterated oils also exhibited certain differences (at 868cm-1, 1022cm-1, 1265cm-1, and 1655cm-1), and the Raman shift intensity tended to decrease gradually with the increasing content of canola and cottonseed oils in the flaxseed oil. Additionally, the results of Raman spectroscopy combined with the "oil microscopy" method exhibited large variations in the radar patterns of the flaxseed, canola, and cottonseed oils, whereas the radar patterns of the flaxseed and adulterated oils closely resembled each other. The results indicated that Raman spectroscopy in combination with oil microscopy more effectively revealed the subtle differences in the Raman shift intensity, serving as a more visual and comprehensive approach for differentiating the quality variations between pure flaxseed oil and other oil species and adulterated oil. Practical Application. This study analyzed the Raman spectra of flaxseed, canola, cottonseed, and adulterated oils using fiber optic Raman spectroscopy. Combined with the oil microscopy method for comprehensive evaluation and analysis, it is feasible to effectively identify the quality differences among flaxseed, canola, cottonseed, and adulterated oils. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	8	3407	3418	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16234					FSTA:2022-12-Ne2757

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Owing to the harsh acidic environment of the stomach, acid-resistant emulsion products have wide-ranging applications in the food industry. Herein, natural soybean lipophilic protein (LP) was used to establish coarse emulsions, nanoemulsions, emulsion gels, and high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPE) under acidic conditions. Furthermore, the carrying characteristics of the acid-resistant emulsion system with lycopene were explored. Results. Comparisons of particle sizes, potentials, microstructures, and rheology of the four carrier systems revealed that HIPPE has a single particle-size distribution, the largest zeta potential, and an elastic gel-like network structure. Comparison of encapsulation rates indicated that HIPPE had the best effect on encapsulating lycopene, reaching approximately 90%. The pH stability, storage stability, and simulated in vitro digestion experiments showed that the four emulsions that were stable under acidic conditions had good acid resistance. Among them, the acid-induced LP-stabilized HIPPE had the best storage stability and superior compatibility with the harsh acidic environment of the stomach, which not only achieved the purpose of delaying the release of lipids but also conferred better protection to lycopene in the gastric tract; moreover, it achieved the best bioavailability. Conclusion. LP-stabilized HIPPE has the best stability and can yield better absorption and utilization of lycopene by the body. The results of this study are helpful for the development of acid-resistant functional emulsion foods that are conducive to the absorption of lycopene. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	13	6146	6155	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11968					FSTA:2022-12-Ae24036
J		Yuanda Sun; Mingming Zhong; Xiaoming Zhao; Hanyu Song; Qi Wang; Baokun Qi; Lianzhou Jiang							Structural and interfacial characteristics of ultrasonicated lipophilic-protein-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsions.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soybean lipophilic protein (LP) can stabilize high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPE) under acidic conditions (pH 2.0); thus, it is vital for the targeted release of functional nutrients. However, the high fat content and low solubility of LP under acidic conditions hinder the functional properties of HIPPEs. We explored the effect of ultrasonic compound acid treatment on the structure and functional properties of LP. The effects of varying ultrasonication power (0, 150, 250, 350, and 450 W) for 10 min on the freeze-thaw stability and interfacial characteristics of the modified LP-stabilized HIPPE were evaluated using particle size, rheological, and differential scanning calorimetry. The results showed that LP sonicated at 350 W exhibited a small particle size (minimum 250 nm), high absolute zeta potential (maximum 28 mV), and the maximum solubility. Following ultrasonication, LP covered the oil-water interface more uniformly, and the adsorbed protein percentage increased significantly (p< 0.05) to 53%. LP-stabilized HIPPE possessed a stronger gel-like network and exhibited significantly increased freeze-thaw stability (p< 0.05). Our results indicate that ultrasonication can change the structural and functional properties of LP, providing a theoretical reference for further applications of acid emulsions in the food industry.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soy-protein-stabilized high internal phase emulsions are widely used in the food industry. However, this food type cannot be suitably absorbed and utilized by the human body. In this study, we successfully prepared acid-treated soy lipophilic protein- (LP), beta-conglycinin- (7S), and globulin (11S)-stabilized high internal phase Pickering emulsions (HIPPEs). The effects of pH on the structure and properties of LP, 7S and 11S were also determined. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that acid treatment changed the secondary structure of the protein. In addition, particle size, zeta potential, and emulsification performance measurements revealed that at pH 2, the three proteins had the smallest sizes, highest charges, and best emulsification stability. Microstructure and rheology analyses showed that at pH 2, protein concentration of 1.5%, and oil-phase volume fraction of 80%, the three proteins formed HIPPEs with gel-like network structures. Among these, LP-stabilized HIPPE had the most stable structure and afforded the best oxidation stability. Simulated in vitro digestion experiments showed that the HIPPE prepared by LP under acidic conditions had good stability in gastric juice and delayed the lipid release. These results can be useful for the development of emulsion-based functional food ingredient delivery systems for targeted and sustained release of nutrients.

Food Research International					Wheat-origin microbiota is a critical factor in the assembly of the microbial community during high-temperature Daqu incubation. However, the succession and functional mechanisms of these microbial communities in Daqu are still unclear. This study investigated the shifts in microbiota diversity from the wheat to the end of incubation by the third generation Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. Results indicated that Staphylococcus, Pantoea, Alternaria, and Mycosphaerella were the dominant genera of wheat-origin microbiota while Bacillus and Thermoascus were the most predominant bacterial and fungal genera of Daqu microbiota, respectively. Metabolite detection revealed that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) changed obviously in different incubation stages and the 7th day to the 15th day of incubation was the critical period for the formation of VOCs. The content of non-VOCs, especially sugars, increased steeply in the first four days of incubation. The network analysis between microbes and metabolites showed that Thermoactinomyces and Staphylococcus had opposite correlations with most non-VOCs. Alternaria and Mycosphaerella had strong positive correlations with fructose. As key functional fungal genera in wheat-origin microbiota, Mycosphaerella, Aspergillus, and Alternaria participated in multiple metabolic pathways (gluconeogenesis I, sucrose degradation III, pentose phosphate pathway, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide biosynthesis I, methyl ketone biosynthesis, and GDP-mannose biosynthesis) at the early stage of incubation, which played an important role in the formation of flavors and succession of microbiota. This work highlighted the shifts and functionality of wheat-origin microbiota in Daqu incubation, which can be a guideline to stabilize Daqu quality by wheat-origin microbiota control.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Dietary omega-3 PUFAs are highly prone to oxidation, and this may potentially limit their application in the health-promoting field. Here, we sought to investigate whether and how oxidized PUFAs modulate the susceptibility of mice to SalmonellaTyphimurium (S. Tm) infection. Algae oil (AO) and oxidized algae oil (ox-AO) were administered to the C57BL/6 mice prior to S. Tm infection. Compared to the S. Tm group, ox-AO increased bacterial burden in systemic and intestinal tissues, downregulated host anti-infection responses, and developed worse colitis. In macrophages, ox-AO decreased both phagocytosis of S. Tm and clearance of intracellular bacteria and dampened the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), NF-kappaB, and autophagy pathways. Furthermore, ox-AO diminished LPS-induced inflammatory cytokine production and S. Tm induced NLRC4 inflammasome activation. This study reveals that oxidized PUFAs may contribute to the development of enteric infections and regular monitoring of the oxidation status in commercial PUFA supplements to prevent their potential adverse impact on human health.										2022	70	21	6407	6417	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00099					FSTA:2022-10-Ge4759
J		Yuandong Yu; Guizhao Liang; Huabin Wang							Interaction mechanism of flavonoids and Tartary buckwheat bran protein: a fluorescence spectroscopic and 3D-QSAR study.		Food Research International					Tartary buckwheat bran protein (TBBP) is a valuable by-product of Tartary buckwheat processing. Current studies have indicated that TBBP is a desirable carrier and protector of flavonoids. However, the quantitative structure-affinity relationship of flavonoids with TBBP still remains to be elucidated. Here, by using the fluorescence spectroscopy method to measure the binding constants of 16 flavonoids with TBBP, we employ a combination of the atom-based three dimensional-quantitative structure-affinity relationships (3D-QSAR) and quantum-chemical calculation to explore the underlying binding mechanisms. We show that flavonoids can cause the intrinsic fluorescence quenching and form non-covalent complexes with TBBP driven by hydrogen bonding and van der Waal forces. The atom-based 3D-QSAR model reveals that the rutoside group at the C-7 position of flavones is favorable to enhance the binding constants of flavonoids with TBBP. Quantum-chemical calculations consistently disclose that the rutoside group can intensify interaction forces of flavonoids, thereby strengthening the binding. This work provides theoretical evidence that TBBP has the potential application to be raw materials for develop functional food, and be the delivery carriers of flavonoids.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					The inhibition of aldose reductase is an effective strategy to alleviate symptoms of diabetic complications. The p-coumaric acid ethyl ester (p-CAEE) was taken as an example to investigate the inhibition of aldose reductase from p-coumaric acid derivations. The results showed p-CAEE strongly inhibited aldose reductase with the half inhibitory concentration of 1.92muM, following the noncompetitive manner with a Ki value of 0.94muM. After binding with p-CAEE, the enzyme showed increased beta-sheet content, and the alpha-helix content, random coil content, and intrinsic fluorescence strength decreased. p-CAEE bonded with aldose reductase at the anionic, hydrophobic, and selective pockets of the enzyme, via hydrogen bond and hydrophobic interactions with Thr113, Cys80, Trp111, and Leu300, etc. The strong inhibition was related to the high oil-water partition coefficient and special esterify group. This study provides new information to develop aldose reductase inhibitors from p-coumaric acid derivations. Practical applications. Inhibition of aldose reductase is an effective strategy to alleviate and control the symptoms of diabetic complications. In this study, it has been shown that p-coumaric acid ethyl ester could strongly inhibit the aldose reductase. In addition, the inhibition of aldose reductase was been correlated with structures and oil-water partition coefficients of p-coumaric acid derivatives. It provides a theoretical basis for the development of effective aldose reductase inhibitors. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14370					FSTA:2023-02-Bg0214

Food Research International					In this study, carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) were used to develop C-NeuAc hydrogels to encapsulate Pediococcus pentosaceus QK-1. The mechanical properties, thermal stability, in vitro degradation, and pH sensitivity of the hydrogel were evaluated. The C-NeuAc concentration required for optimal hydrogel performance was 3% (w/v). Hydrogel swelling behaviour was effectively assessed by Fickian diffusion and Schott's second-order kinetic models. The hydrogel demonstrated excellent biocompatibility and low in vitro cytotoxicity. An in vitro assay revealed that the viability of Pediococcus pentosaceusQK-1 in C-NeuAc had decreased by only 1.41 log (CFU/ mL) after exposure to simulated acidic gastric fluid. Moreover, the survival rate of the encapsulated and free Pediococcus pentosaceusQK-1 cells were 80.1% and virtually zero, respectively, after passage through the gastrointestinal tract. It was empirically determined that low temperature and freeze-drying were the ideal condition and method to ensure storage longevity of the hydrogel-encapsulated probiotic. Hence, C-NeuAc hydrogel is highly desirable as a food-grade probiotic delivery vehicle.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					C-NeuAc/OHEC hydrogels were prepared from carboxymethyl chitosan/N-acetylneuraminic acid (C-NeuAc) and oxidised hydroxyethyl cellulose (OHEC), and used as novel vehicles for the co-encapsulation of Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1 and isomaltose-oligosaccharide (IMO). The thermal stability, rheological behaviour, swelling kinetics, porosity, pH sensitivity, and degradability of the hydrogels were evaluated. The hydrogels were most stable and were suitable as vehicles for co-encapsulation of Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1 and IMO when C-NeuAc:OHEC = 5:4. In the presence of IMO, the encapsulation efficiency of the hydrogel was optimal and in the range of 91.02-94.63%. An in vitro assay revealed that the C-NeuAc/OHEC hydrogel provided good protection for Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1 against the harsh conditions of a simulated gastrointestinal tract. The survival rate of Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1 was only 77.0% in the presence of free IMO. By contrast, the survival rates of Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1 co-encapsulated with 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% IMO were 84.4%, 90.8%, and 90.3%, respectively. Hence, IMO co-encapsulation significantly improved probiotic survival. Moreover, co-encapsulation with 1.0% IMO and 4 °C were the optimal storage condition for Pediococcus pentosaceus RQ-1. The present work showed that C-NeuAc/OHEC hydrogels are promising as probiotic co-encapsulation delivery vehicles.

J		Yuangang Zhu; Xiu Zhang; Yanyan Xiao; Jinpeng Chu; Zhongmin Dai							Variation of floret development and grain setting characteristics in winter wheat responses to delayed sowing.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Wheat floret development has been a focus of research due to a desire to improve spike fertility, which majorly influences grain yield. Sowing date plays a vital role on grain yield in wheat, and increase in the grain number per spike of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been obtained by delayed sowing. During the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 growing seasons, variation in these developmental patterns was explored involving two winter wheat cultivars (Jimai 22 and Tainong 18) and five sowing dates (24 September; 1, 8, 15 and 22 October). Results. We noticed clear differences in the grain number per spikelet; delayed sowing had a greater impact on the number of fertile florets at anthesis than grain set. Significant differences in the developmental patterns of florets among spikelet positions corresponded to variations in the floret developmental rate, with faster floret development associated with higher floret fertility. Delayed sowing did not affect the grain number near the rachis, but significantly promoted grain set on distal florets. Increased spike dry weight (SDW) did not compensate for floret size or grain weight, mainly due to enhanced assimilate partitioning to florets. Conclusion. Delayed sowing significantly affects floret developmental dynamics, causing differences in winter wheat floret fertility. An increased SDW concomitant with improved intra-spike partitioning before anthesis contributes to increase the distal floret numbers per spike and then optimize winter wheat spike fertility. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4892	4908	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11853					FSTA:2022-11-Mj6464

Journal of Functional Foods					Panax ginseng polysaccharides (GPS) are isolated from Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, which has many pharmacological activities. However, although the protective effect of GPS on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been characterized, its mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we clarified it effect on IBD in mice and studied the mechanism of reducing inflammation. IBD model was established in mice by administrating dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Our results showed that GPS treatment significantly relieved disease activity index, colon length shortening and pathological changes in colonic tissue. Furthermore, GPS treatment significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines in the colonic tissue via inhibiting JAK2/STAT1/NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that GPS could attenuate inflammatory response via inhibiting JAK2/STAT1/NLPR3 inflammasome signalling pathway. Hence, GPS may be a potential natural medicine to inhibit JAK2/STAT1/NLRP3 inflammasome signalling pathway and reduce inflammation in IBD.

Food Chemistry					Biodegradable and antimicrobial films without antibiotics are of great significance for the application associated with food packaging meanwhile minimizing the negative impact on environments. In this work, cellulose-based films with the surface tailor-constructed with ZnO nanopillars (ZnO NPs@Zn2+/Cel films) were prepared via chemical crosslinking in conjunction with a hydrothermal process for in-situ growth of ZnO NPs. As a packaging material, ZnO NPs@Zn2+/Cel films possess excellent mechanical properties, oxygen and water vapor barrier, food preservation, biodegradability and low Zn2+ migration. Moreover, ZnO NPs@Zn2+/Cel films show remarkable antimicrobial activity, especially for Staphylococcus aureus (gram-positive bacteria) and Escherichia coli (gram-negative bacteria). The antimicrobial mechanism of ZnO NPs@Zn2+/Cel films is studied using the controlled variable method, and results showed that the film without UV pretreatment killed bacterial cells mainly by mechanical rupture, while the film with UV pretreatment killed bacterial cells mainly via the synergistic effect of photocatalytic oxidation and mechanical rupture.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Condensed tannins the polyphenolic compounds that are widespread in plants have been proved to have antitumor potential. Here, we purified the bioactive condensed tannins from leaves of Ulmus pumila L. and explored their structural characteristics, antitumor effect on TFK-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells as well as the related potential mechanism. The UV-Vis, FT-IR spectroscopy, ESI-Full-MS, and thiolysis-HPLC-ESI-MS demonstrated that U. pumila condensed tannins (UCTs) consisted essentially of procyanidins with epicatechin as the main flavan-3-ol extension unit. The UCTs could significantly reduce the survival rate of human cholangiocarcinoma TFK-1, SK-CHA-1, and MZ-CHA-1 cells with the better inhibitory effect on TFK-1 cell proliferation. Flow cytometric assay showed that UCTs affected TFK-1 survival by G2/M phase arrest and inducing apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, a total of 6592 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), consisting of 94 upregulated and 6498 downregulated DEGs, were identified between untreated and UCTs-treated TFK-1 cells using RNA-seq technology. Enrichment analysis based on the KEGG database revealed that these DEGs were closely associated with cell cycle and p53 apoptotic signaling pathways. Furthermore, qRT-PCR confirmed that treatment of UCTs to TFK-1 cells caused significant changes in the expression of cyclin E, cdc25 A, cytochrome c, caspase-3, and caspase-8. These results indicated that UCTs exhibited the growth inhibition effect on TFK-1 cells possibly via G2/M cell cycle arrest and activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis, and had potential as an anti-cholangiocarcinoma drug for further development. Practical applications. Ulmus pumila L. As a valuable tree species has been widely used in fields of medicine and food. Condensed tannins, the polyphenolic compounds widespread in plants, have been proved to have antitumor potential and be safe to normal cells. In this study, the condensed tannins from leaves of U. pumila (UCTs) remarkably suppressed cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell viability possibly via G2/M cell cycle arrest and activation of caspase-cascade to induce apoptosis.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					2′-Fucosyllactose (2′-FL) is the most abundant oligosaccharide in human milk. In this study, a highly efficient biosynthetic route for 2′-FL production was designed via the de novo pathway of GDP-l-fucose using engineered Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Specifically, plasmid-based strains with previously deleted lacZ and wcaJ were further reconstructed by introducing de novo pathway genes and alpha1,2-fucosyltransferase-encoding wbgL to realize 2′-FL synthesis. The 2′-FL titer was enhanced to 3.92g/L by further introducing rcsA and rcsB. Subsequently, the additional wbgL expression cassette was chromosomally integrated into recA locus to strengthen fucosylation reaction and a strong constitutive promoter (PJ23119) was used to replace the original promoters of manC-manB and gmd-wcaG to improve 2′-FL synthesis.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Pork preservation and cooking are common processes in food production. This study analyzed the influence of cinnamon essential oil nanoemulsions (CEON), epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) and CEON/epsilon-PL on microbial community and quality of pork during refrigerated storage and radio frequency (RF) cooking. Results. Showed that a stable CEON was prepared with soybean lecithin (oil: lecithin = 1:1 w/w). CEON and epsilon-PL inhibited the growth of total bacteria counts (TBC) of raw pork, and caused Salmonella reduction at refrigerated storage of 12 d. Photobacterium and Pseudomonas were dominant spoilage bacteria of raw pork during refrigerated period. The 0.25 % CEON and 0.125 % CEON + 0.25 % epsilon-PL had good antimicrobial effects against Photobacterium while 0.5 % epsilon-PL had a small effect. Pork treated by CEON and CEON/epsilon-PL had better freshness than control and epsilon-PL treated samples. RF cooking lowered cooking time compared to water bath cooking at 80°C and a similar quality of cooked pork was observed. CEON/epsilon-PL promoted Salmonella and TBC inactivation during RF cooking. TVB-N content, pH, cooking loss and appearance of RF cooked pork were not influenced by the addition of CEON/epsilon-PL, but the odor was slightly affected. The hardness, springiness and chewiness were enhanced by the addition of CEON/epsilon-PL. The results revealed that CEON/epsilon-PL could be used in raw pork preservation and promote bacteria inactivation during RF cooking.

J		Yuanmei Xu; Juanjuan Xu; Gaoji Yang; Xiangyu Guan; Rui Li; Shaojin Wang							Combined effects of intermittent radio frequency heating with cinnamon oil vapor on microbial control and quality changes of alfalfa seeds.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Alfalfa sprouts have high nutritional values when consumed raw, but are easily contaminated by food pathogens. This study aimed to evaluate effects of essential oil (EO) vapors, RF heating and their combinations on microbial inactivation, germination rate and generated sprouts' quality of alfalfa seeds at moisture contents of 7.52%, 9.53% and 11.45% wet basis (w.b.). Results showed that cinnamon oil and oregano oil vapors both had antimicrobial effects against Salmonella on alfalfa seeds and cinnamon oil vapor had a little better activity. Weibull model well fitted the Salmonella inactivation curves under RF heating. The rate of Salmonella inactivation increased but germination rate decreased with increasing temperature and moisture content of seeds. The intermittent RF treatments improved the heating uniformity and germination rate of the whole batch of seeds as compared to the continuous RF heating. The combination of intermittent RF heating and cinnamon oil vapor exhibited additive antimicrobial effects, up to 3.99-4.12 log CFU/g Salmonella reductions, and maintained the germination rate above 90%. However, for natural microbial decontamination, combined treatments only caused 0.56-0.82 log CFU/g reductions of total bacterial counts. The fresh weight, length, flavor, the content of phenolics and ascorbic acid, and antioxidant capacity of generated sprouts were not significantly impacted. The study provided an effective method for microbial control on sprouting seeds.

J		Yuanmei Xu; Rui Li; Kui Li; Jiangtao Yu; Junqing Bai; Shaojin Wang							Inactivation of inoculated Salmonella and natural microflora on two kinds of edible seeds by radio frequency heating combined with cinnamon oil vapor.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sesame seed and flaxseed are oilseeds with many health benefits but with possible microbial contaminations, especially Salmonella, resulting in a potential health risk when consumed in raw form. In this study, plant essential oils (EOs) vapor, radio frequency (RF) heating and their combined treatments were applied to inactivate inoculated Salmonella and natural microflora on sesame seed and flaxseed. Cinnamon oil vapor and oregano oil vapor both at the concentration of 0.42-3.33 muL/mL treating for 7 d caused significant Salmonella reductions on these two kinds of seeds and cinnamon oil vapor had the better effect relatively. Weibull model was suitable to describe the thermal inactivation behaviors of Salmonella on edible seeds by RF heating. RF heating at 80°C and 85°C for 5 min combined with cinnamon oil vapor at 0.83 muL/mL for 3 d caused more than 5 log CFU/g reductions of Salmonella on sesame seed and flaxseed, respectively, but only 0.96 and 1.42 log CFU/g reductions of total bacterial counts, or 1.05 and 1.56 log CFU/g reductions of yeast and mold on sesame seed and flaxseed. Combined treatments did not cause damages on seeds' quality. This study provides a new method for Salmonella inactivation on dry edible seeds.

J		Yuanming Chu; Mingtang Tan; Chuhan Bian; Jing Xie							Effect of ultrasonic thawing on the physicochemical properties, freshness, and protein-related properties of frozen large yellow croaker (Pseudosciaena crocea).		Journal of Food Science					Ultrasonic treatment (UT) was used to thaw large yellow croaker in this study, and the effect of various ultrasonic power levels on the quality of large yellow croaker was evaluated after thawing. The effects of ultrasonic on water holding capacity (WHC), moisture distribution, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARs), total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N), ATP degradation (related to K value), surface color change, free amino acid (FAA) content, total sulfhydryl group (SH) content, Fourier transform infrared absorption spectra (FT-IR), fluorescence emission spectra, and microscopic observations of large yellow croaker myofibrillar proteins were investigated. The thawing times of the control sample, 200UT, 240UT, 280UT, and 320UT samples were 1750, 1190, 810, 580, and 570 s, respectively, which indicated that ultrasonic radiation could improve thawing efficiency. Additionally, ultrasonic thawing maintained better freshness and color and inhibited lipid oxidation. Compared with fresh samples, the TVB-N of large yellow croaker thawed by ultrasonication increased by 12.68%, and the K value increased by 0.9%. The 240UT sample had tightly arranged myofibrils and fewer changes in the structures of myogenic fibrillar proteins than the fresh samples, and the SH content of 240UT was decreased by 8.17%. Use of excessive ultrasonic power (320 W) damaged the protein microstructure and the microstructure of large yellow croaker. In conclusion, sample 240UT maintained the quality of large yellow croaker better with minimal damage, which is recommended for rapid thawing. Practical Application. Ultrasonic waves improve the thawing efficiency of large yellow croaker and maintain the freshness and color of the fish. According to results, sample 240UT exhibited slight changes in the structure of the myofibril protein, but excessive ultrasonic power destroyed the microstructure and protein structure. Appropriate ultrasonic treatment to the thawing of fish has good prospects. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	1	52	67	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.15983					FSTA:2022-05-Rc1725
J		Yuanning Wu; Guodong Ye; Xiaoning Li; Liping Wang; Yanxiang Liu; Bin Tan; Wangyang Shen; Jian Zhou							Comparison of quality characteristics of six reconstituted whole wheat flour with different modified bran.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of six bran modification treatment (microwaving, steam, extrusion, enzymolysis, fermentation and superheated steam) on the quality characteristics of reconstituted whole wheat flour were compared. As shown by the results, the treatments modified the physicochemical and pasting property, dynamic rheology, mixing characteristics, intermolecular forces and secondary protein structure of the reconstituted flour. The peak viscosity and final viscosity after microwaving were the highest, at 2528.00 and 3154.33 cp, respectively. The tandelta values after fermentation, superheated steam and microwaving were higher than control, indicating improved flour processing quality. Enzymolysis resulted in the longest dough stability time and the shortest dough formation time, as well as the highest disulfide bridge content and ionic bond force in the dough gluten component, which would strengthen the dough gluten network. Microwaving resulted in the highest beta-sheet content and the weakest hydrophobic interactions in the gluten, which would also strengthen the dough gluten network. Overall, enzymolysis produced the greatest strengthening of gluten network and improvement in dough rheological properties. These findings advance the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of the bran treatments and will aid future optimization of industrial bran modification.

Food Chemistry					Numerous species of Origanum (Lamiaceae) have been widely used as spices to extend the shelf life of foods. Essential oils extracted from this genus have attracted much attention owing to their potential applications as bactericides. Here, we evaluated the chemical compositions of eight oregano essential oils (OEOs) using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and assessed their antibacterial activities. The chemical compositions of OEOs were affected by the cultivar factor, and seven common compounds, including carvacrol, were identified among eight OEOs. Partial least squares discriminant analysis enabled the distinction of three groups among these OEOs, as characterized by the proportions of carvacrol, thymol, and sesquiterpenes. OEOs effectively inhibited Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus with varying antibacterial activities. Spearman correlation network highlighted core antibacterial contributors in the chemical profiles of OEOs. Our results revealed that the bacteriostatic effects of OEOs could be explained by core compounds and their synergistic effects.

Food Research International					In this study, soybean dietary fiber (DF) was used as nutritional supplement and gel enhancer in soy protein isolate (SPI) gels. The effects of DF particle sizes (100-mesh, DF100; 200-mesh, DF200), DF content and transglutaminase (TGase) addition on the gel properties of DF-enriched soy protein isolate (DSPI) gels were studied. The results showed that 10 % DF100 was beneficial for improving gel hardness (from 137.61 to 148.86 g), but caused the declined gel cohesiveness (from 0.87 to 0.80). With the use of 10 % DF200, the gel cohesiveness was improved from 0.80 to 0.83. However, the water holding capacity of DSPI gels containing DF200 was poor and the ionic and hydrogen bonds were reduced. When 20 % DF100 was added, the overall gel quality decreased. The effect of TGase depended on situations. When DF was well wrapped, the addition of TGase improved the textural property and the beta-turn proportion (from 40.22 % to 42.88 %) of DSPI gels owing to the enhanced protein cross-linking. While when SPI was separated by excessive amount of DF, the addition of TGase caused the deteriorated gel properties because TGase-induced local protein aggregation destroyed the gel continuousness. This research will guide the rational application of DF in gel products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	161				0963-9969				10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111876					FSTA:2023-01-Jn1350

Food Analytical Methods					Cysteine (Cys) is a critical biologically active sulfhydryl molecule that plays essential roles in anti-oxidation and maintains protein structure and function. In addition, Cys is also a vital nutrient in many foods. Therefore, the detection of Cys is highly required for food quality control and revealing the biological functions of Cys. Herein, we presented an effective fluorescent probe (denoted as DDP-C) for sensing Cys. The probe can produce a swift off-on fluorescence response to Cys and two other significant biothiols (homocysteine and glutathione) with emission in the deep-red to the near-infrared region (600-700 nm). The probe has a large Stokes shift (140 nm), as well as high selectivity and sensitivity. The linear range for Cys detection is 0.5-20muM, and the detection limit is 37 nM. DDP-C can also realize the quantitative determination of Cys in milk samples and imaging of intracellular biothiols. Therefore, the probe can serve as a powerful tool for Cys sensing. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	8	2145	2154	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-022-02280-9					FSTA:2023-02-Pe0758

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope Regulating the gut microecology by probiotics is an efficient strategy to rational prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, there is currently a lack of well-known probiotic species in the protection against AD, and the involved mechanism has not been clearly interpreted. Methods and results. Herein, Lactobacillus plantarum MA2 (MA2), a functional probiotic isolated from traditional Chinese Tibetan kefir grains, is demonstrated to improve the cognitive deficits and anxiety-like behaviors in the d-galactose/AlCl3 induced AD rats, and attenuate the neuronal degeneration and Abeta accumulation in the brain. Moreover, the study finds MA2 could alleviate the intestinal mucosal impairments, and impedes the activation of microglia and neuroinflammation through TLR4/MYD88/NLRP3 signaling pathway. 16S rRNA sequencing and metabolomic analysis indicate that MA2 reshapes the gut microbiota structure and composition, and remarkably modulates the glycometabolism. In that case, the exopolysaccharides (EPS) that derived from MA2 is furtherly proved with inhibitory effects on the Abeta42 aggregation and amyloid-induced cytotoxicity. Conclusion. MA2 or MA2 EPS may be used as functional food and nutritional supplement for regulating the gut microbiota and metabolism disorders in AD. This study is of great significance to develop new intervention and therapeutic strategy on AD using probiotics and their metabolites. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	19			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202200265					FSTA:2023-01-Aj1612

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					HongJun Tofu is produced by fungal (named "HongJun") fermentation of okara, which is a major byproduct of the soymilk and tofu industry. The dynamic characteristics of the fungal community (predominantly "HongJun") might have significant influences on HongJun Tofu during a short period, however, this remains unclear. In the present study, the "HongJun" was identified, and the edible quality of HongJun Tofu including nutritional composition, physical properties, and sensory level was evaluated. Further, the correlation between fungal diversity and edible quality during fermentation was analyzed. The results showed that "HongJun" is a novel strain (named OM009248) of Neurospora crassa. In the pre-fermentation (0-24 h), Neurospora crassa multiplied rapidly and reached the maximum abundance, while in the pro-fermentation (24-48 h), other fungi including Trichosporon and Rhizopus occupied certain content. The correlation analysis showed that Neurospora crassa was positively correlated with increased nutrients including oligopeptides, free amino acids (FAAs), beta-carotene, and soluble dietary fiber (SDF) as well as enhanced texture, including springiness and chewiness; Trichosporon was negatively correlated with fat and Rhizopus was positively correlated with SDF. These findings provide a theoretical reference for quality control of HongJun Tofu commercial production.

Food Bioscience					Sea buckthorn has been proved to be a good substrate for lactic acid bacteria (LAB), but the research on the fermentation of sea buckthorn juice (SBJ) by LAB is still rare. This study was designed to determine the performance of fermented SBJ (FSBJ) in four LAB and investigate the sensory aspects of FSBJ. The results showed that the utilization rates of reducing sugar, titratable acid, and malic acid of SBJ fermented by Lactobacillus casei (SBJLc) were the highest and that lactic acid content was the greatest. The organic acid compositions of the four kinds of FSBJs were also different. The viable counts of all FSBJs was greater than 7 log CFU/mL, and that the viable count of SBJ fermented by SBJLc was the highest. In this study, the Electronic tongue combined with Electronic nose was used for the first time to study SBJ. Results showed that compared with the control, the response value of Sourness was significantly increased, while Bitterness and Astringency were significantly decreased. There was a significant difference in four FSBJs. The results of the electronic nose showed that SBJ fermented by Lactobacillus plantarum LP56 (SBJLp) could be well identified by sensors sensitive to aromatic substances. The volatile compound contents before and after fermentation were significantly different, the highest being SBJLp. Finally, the results of sensory evaluation experiments showed that SBJLp was the most acceptable to consumers in terms of sensory evaluation.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					As tetracycline (TET) residue does great harm to human health, it is urgently required to quantify it in animal-derived foods. In this paper, a fluorescent detection probe was synthesized by natural red beet pigment via one-pot hydrothermal method. The red beet pigment carbon dots (RBP-CDs) were evenly dispersed in water with an average diameter of 4.66 nm, and their surface were rich of amino, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups. TET was able to quench the fluorescence of RBP-CDs within 5 min owing to inner filter effect (IFE) and photo-induced electron transfer (PET), and the quenching rate had good linear responses with the concentration of TET in the linear range of 0.5-30 muM and 30-90 muM, respectively. The detection limit was calculated to be 0.36 muM. Moreover, RBP-CDs had a good TET detection performance in food samples with complicated matrix, such as milk, egg and chicken. Due to its safe and easy synthesis procedure, good selectivity and high sensitivity, RBP-CDs will be put to wide use as a environment-friendly and rapid fluorescent probe in TET detection.

Food Chemistry					The biological activity and absorption of curcumin (Cur) is limited in application due to its low water solubility, poor stability and rapid metabolism. In this work, Cur loaded (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)/poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP) nanoparticles (CEP-NPs) was successfully fabricated via self-assembly driven by hydrogen bonding, providing with desirable Cur-loading efficiency, high stability, strong antioxidant capacity, and pH-triggered intestinal targeted release properties. Molecular dynamics simulations further indicated the Cur was coated with EGCG and PVP in CEP-NPs and high acid prolonged release property was attribute to low ionization degree of EGCG. Besides, the enhanced intestinal absorption of Cur was related to inhibition of Cur metabolism by EGCG, enhancement of cellular uptake and higher Caco-2 monolayer permeation. Pharmacokinetic study showed that the oral bioavailability presented nearly 12-fold increment. Therefore, this study provides a new horizon for improving the Cur utilization in food and pharmaceutical fields.

Food Bioscience					Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs) and their products are multi-functional health supplements. This study aimed to explore the diversity of microorganisms in Tibetan kefir grains (TKGs) and the protective effect of isolates on ethanol-treated HepG2 cells. Metagenomic sequencing showed that Lactobacillus Kefiranofaciens was the most abundant bacterial taxon, while Kluyveromyces marxianus was the most abundant fungal taxum in TKGs. Thirteen isolates belonging to the genera Lactobacillus (3), Fructobacillus (1), Lactococcus (1), Pediococcus (1), Acetobacter (3), and Kluyveromyces (4), were obtained by cultivation methods. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that K. marxianus contributed four KEGG pathways related to hepatic disease. LC-MS analysis revealed CFEs are rich sources of peptides amino acids, lipids and amino acids. Cell-free extracts (CFEs) prepared from K. marxianus protected HepG2 cells from ethanol-induced injury. Treatment with CFEs from isolates YG-4 and YK-6 significantly increased cell viability and reduced ethanol cytotoxicity. Also, YG-4 and YK-6 decreased reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde and alanine aminotransferase, increased superoxide dismutase and catalase, and reduced apoptosis and loss of potential in mitochondria. In addition, CFEs, especially YG-4-derived CFEs, decreased ethanol-induced inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-17 and TNF-alpha), while YG-4 and YK-6 CFEs upregulated the regulatory cytokine IL-4. Thus, YG-4 had the most significant anti-inflammatory effects by reducing ethanol-induced oxidative stress. These isolates' properties may provide new avenues to use K. maxianus in alcoholic liver disease.

Food Chemistry					Triterpenoids are hypoglycemic substances and flavor components of Momordica charantia L., whether their bitterness correlated with hypoglycemic potential remain unknown. Thus, triterpenoids in M. charantia were isolated by phytochemical methods and identified by spectroscopic analysis. The bitterness levels and hypoglycaemic activity of isolated triterpenoids were evaluated by electronic tongue and hepatic gluconeogenesis assay. Eighteen triterpenoids including two new ones, Momordicoside Y and Z, were identified. Among the six identified bitter triterpenoids, karaviloside III, goyaglycoside C, and momordicoside F2 were bitterer than caffeine (P < 0.05), with caffeine equivalent (CE) values of 289.19, 4.32, and 41.24 mg CE/mg, respectively. Momordicoside Y, charantoside C, momordicoside F1, and momordicoside G could inhibit hepatic gluconeogenesis by 23.9%, 36.2%, 33.4%, 34.4% at 40 muM, respectively. These four compounds could interact with active site of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase in molecular docking simulation.

Food Control					The zearalenone (ZEN) lactonase from Gliocladium roseum (ZENG), possessing high activity but poor thermostability, is insufficient to meet the requirements of the feed industry. In this study, two potential hotspots, S162 and S220 in ZENG, were obtained through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations. In the first round, two mutants including S162P and S220R with increased thermostability were screened. Furthermore, the half-life (t1/2) of S162P/S220R mutant at 55 °C was increased by 36.8-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme, and the melting temperature (Tm) was significantly increased by 8.2 °C. MD and structure analysis showed that the improvement in the thermostability of S162P/S220R was possibly in relation to the decreased root mean square fluctuations (RMSF) value, enhanced structural stability, and increased hydrogen bonds. To the best of our knowledge, the thermostability of the mutant S162P/S220R ranked the first of all reported ZEN lactonases, indicating a good candidate for efficient elimination of ZEN, especially at high processing temperatures.

Food Research International					Loquat fruit is vulnerable to chilling injury (CI) under long-term low temperature storage. The application of calcium chloride (CaCl2) can alleviate CI in loquat fruit, however, the molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, the loquat fruit were immersed in 1 % CaCl2 solution for 10min and then stored at 1 1°C for 35 d. The results showed that CaCl2 treatment suppressed the increases in internal browning index, electrolyte leakage, and malonaldehyde content in loquat fruit under chilling stress. The internal browning index in CaCl2-treated loquat fruit was 33.34 % lower than that in the control at the end of storage. Meanwhile, CaCl2 treatment delayed the phospholipids degradation, and retained high level of unsaturated/saturated fatty acid ratio, which was 15.21 % higher than that in the control fruit at the end of storage. The CaCl2 treatment also decreased the enzymatic activities and gene expressions of phospholipase D (PLD), phospholipase C (PLC), and lipoxygenase (LOX) in loquat fruit during cold storage. Moreover, a calmodulin-binding transcription activator (CAMTA) transcription factor (TF), EjCAMTA5, was cloned from loquat fruit. The EjCAMTA5 expression was up-regulated by cold stress and CaCl2 treatment. Further investigation revealed that EjCAMTA5 directly bound to the promoters of EjPLC6-like and EjLOX5 to repress their transcription. Taken together, these findings implied that CaCl2 application could activate the EjCAMTA5-mediated transcriptional repression of EjPLC6-like and EjLOX5 genes, which contributed to delaying the degradation of membrane lipid and maintaining the integrity of cell membrane, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of browning in loquat fruit under chilling stress.

J		Yuanyuan Hou; Liangyi Zhao; Bing Xie; Shunqing Hu; Yonghua Zheng; Peng Jin							EjCaM7 and EjCAMTA3 synergistically alleviate chilling-induced lignification in loquat fruit by repressing the expression of lignin biosynthesis genes.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Flesh lignification is a typical chilling injury (CI) symptom of loquat fruit during cold storage. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) could enhance chilling tolerance in loquat fruit, but the molecular mechanism is still not illuminated. In this study, CaCl2 treatment could decrease the activities and genes expression of peroxidase (POD) laccase (LAC), and inhibit the increase in firmness and lignin accumulation, thereby alleviating chilling-induced lignification in loquat fruit. Additionally, CaCl2 enhanced the calmodulin (CaM) content, free Ca2+ distribution, EjCaM7, and CaM binding transcription activator 3 (EjCAMTA3) expression in loquat fruit during cold storage, indicating Ca2+/CaM-CAMTA might be played a key role in response to cold stress. Moreover, the EjCAMTA3 and EjCaM7 proteins were identified and characterized from loquat fruit. EjCAMTA3 bound to the CG-box in EjPOD64 and EjLAC12-like promoters to repress their transcription. Further analysis revealed that EjCaM7 interacted with EjCAMTA3 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, and this interaction enhanced the EjCAMTA3-mediated transcriptional repression of EjPOD64 and EjLAC12-like genes. Taken together, these findings suggested that CaCl2 treatment alleviates chilling-induced lignification in loquat fruit, which probably via the synergistic role of EjCaM7 and EjCAMTA3 in the modulation of EjPOD64 and EjLAC12-like genes expression, leading to the repression of lignin polymerization.

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to investigate the effects of roasting temperature and time on aldehyde formation derived from lipid oxidation in scallop, and the deterrent effect of natural antioxidants extracted from bamboo leaves (AOB). Results showed that roasting process significantly increased the peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), p-Anisidine value (p-AV), and total oxidation (TOTOX) in scallop lipids. Besides, 16 different aldehydes in scallop lipids were detected using an HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Among them, the content of hexanal, pentanal, nonanal, trans, trans-2,4-octadienal, and 4-hydroxy-2-hexenal increased in a time-and temperature-dependent manner during the roasting process. After roasting at 210 °C for 40 min, their content increased by 1.23, 0.81, 1.44, 0.59, and 2.12 folds compared with the unroasted group, respectively. However, pretreatment with AOB effectively prevented aldehyde formation in roasted scallops by reducing the oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and scavenging free radicals.

Food Chemistry					Squalene and beta-sitosterol are health-benefit compounds due to their nutritional and medicinal properties. It has been reported that the content of these bioactive compounds is relatively high in Torreya grandis nuts. However, it is not yet known what changes in squalene and beta-sitosterol accumulation occur during the special post-ripening process of T. grandis nuts and the effect of the well-known ripening hormone ethylene on the regulatory mechanism of their biosynthetic pathways. Thus, we performed transcriptome and metabolite analyses. The results showed that ethylene not only promoted the post-ripening process but also enhanced the accumulation of squalene by inducing gene expression in the mevalonate pathway. At the same time, ethylene treatment also promoted the accumulation of other sterols but inhibited gene expression in the beta-sitosterol biosynthesis pathway. In addition, co-expression and correlation analysis suggested a framework for the transcriptional regulation of squalene and beta-sitosterol biosynthesis genes under ethylene treatment.

Food Chemistry					The postharvest ripening stage is necessary for Torreya grandis (T. grandis) nuts to complete aromatic synthesis, which requires appropriate temperature and relative humidity (RH). Currently, scarce information is available regarding the changes in aroma profiles in T. grandis nuts and the relationship with their response to different environmental conditions. Therefore, the interaction of temperature (20 °C or 30 °C) and relative humidity (70% RH or 90% RH) was investigated on aromatic substances after harvest. The results showed that 56 aromatic components were detected by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) and mainly divided into five categories, among which terpenes were the most abundant (56.2-86.7%). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that both temperature and humidity can affect the aroma composition, and terpenes were mainly influenced by humidity. Specifically, D-limonene occupied the largest proportion of terpenes (63.0-90.8%) and was significantly upregulated by high humidity.

Journal of Dairy Science					Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a common toxin in dairy products that causes acute and chronic human health disorders. Thus, the development of a rapid and accurate AFM1 detection method is of vital importance for food safety monitoring. This work was to develop a novel electrochemical aptasensor for sensitive and specific determination of AFM1. The dendritic-like nanostructure was formed on the gold electrode surface by layer-by-layer assembly of gold-silver core-shell nanoparticles modified with DNA conjugates. In the presence of AFM1, the specific recognition between AFM1 and Apt caused the disassociation of the DNA controlled dual Au@Ag conjugates from the surface of the electrode, causing less methylene blue to bind to the surface and weakening the electrochemical signal. The more AFM1 there is, the weaker the electrochemical signal. Transmission electron microscope results showed that the successfully synthesized Au@Ag nanoparticles exhibited a core-shell structure with Au as core and Ag as shell, and their average diameter was about 30nm. Under optimal conditions, the electrochemical aptasensor showed a wide detection ranging from 0.05 ng mL-1 to 200 ng mL-1, and a low detection limit of 0.02 ng mL-1. Moreover, the proposed strategy has been successfully applied to the detection of AFM1 in cow, goat, and sheep milk samples with satisfactory recoveries ranging from 91.10% to 104.05%. This work can provide a novel rapid detection method for AFM1, and also provide a new sensing platform for the detection of other toxins.

Food Research International					Excessive nitrite residue is one of the bottlenecks in the production of many fermented foods. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum PK25 obtained from traditional Chinese pickles exhibited excellent nitrite degradation ability. Here, transcriptome, protein-protein interaction networks, and phenotype were performed to evaluate systematically the mechanism of nitrite degradation of L. plantarum PK25. The results demonstrated that genes expression varied considerably at key time points for nitrite degradation. 553 (upregulated: 366, downregulated: 187) and 767 (upregulated: 425, downregulated: 342) differentially expressed genes were identified at 6 h and 24 h, respectively. The hub genes were mainly enriched in carbohydrate metabolism, energy metabolism, and nucleotide synthesis. PK25 expanded its carbon source utilizing profile and improved glycolysis to produce more ATP to counteract environmental stress. The related enzymes including glycoside hydrolase, sugar ABC transporter protein, and PTS sugar transporter were 5.714,5.885, and 3.578-fold upregulated at the transcriptional level. For strain to sustain energy levels and acid generation, pyruvate metabolism was critical, with the result that phosphoenolpyruvate synthase and pyruvate oxidase were up-regulated to accelerate the pyruvate transition. To repair DNA lesions induced by nitrite, both base excision repair mechanism and recombinational DNA repair pathway were exploited, such as endodeoxyribonuclease upregulated 5.314 and 19.687-fold at the two moments. The results provided a theoretical reference and practical possibility to reduce nitrite residue and improve safety during food fermented products.

J		Yuanyuan Liu; Cheng Yang; Qun Wang; Jian Zhang; Lianfu Zhang							Identification and confirmation of key compounds causing cooked off-flavor in heat-treated tomato juice.		Journal of Food Science					Cooked off-flavor produced by heat treatment greatly limited the acceptability of commercial tomato juice. To screen and identify the cooked off-flavor compounds, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O), aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and odor activity value (OAV) calculation were applied simultaneously. The results showed that there were 17 aroma-active compounds in tomato juice samples. Among them, three newly formed sulfur-containing compounds (dimethyl sulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, and methional) and 1-octen-3-one, which exhibited cooked corn/potato, onion, and mushroom odor, were proved to be responsible for the cooked off-flavor in heat-treated tomato juice (HTJ) by omission experiments and electronic nose analysis. The three newly formed sulfur-containing compounds were further confirmed to be the key compounds responsible for the cooked off-flavor in four different tomato cultivars that were commonly consumed in the market. Practical Application. Tomato is one of the most popular vegetables in the world and tomato juice is an important part of the tomato industry. However, the cooked off-flavor of tomato juice after sterilization severely restricts its industrial development. This study analyzed and compared the changes of aroma compounds before and after sterilization, and identified and confirmed the major off-flavor components. This work could provide fundamental information for the prevention of cooked off-flavor. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	6	2515	2526	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16168					FSTA:2022-10-Hq9701

Food Chemistry					The quality of tomatoes is usually predicted by measuring a single index, rather than a comprehensive index. To find a comprehensive index, visible and near infrared (Vis-NIR) hyperspectral imaging was used for capturing the images of three varieties of tomatoes, and twelve quality indexes were measured as the reference standards. The changing trends and correlations of different indexes were analyzed, and comprehensive quality index (CQI) was proposed through factor analysis. The characteristic wavelengths were selected by successive projection algorithm (SPA) based on the hyperspectral data, which was used to establish three regression models for CQI prediction. The result indicated that MLR achieved good performance withRV2 = 0.87, RMSEV = 1.33 and RPD = 2.58. After that, spatial distribution map was generated to visualize the CQI in tomato fruit. This study indicated that the comprehensive quality of tomatoes can be predicted non-destructively based on hyperspectral imaging and chemometrics, determining the optimal harvesting period.

Food Chemistry					The growing interest in the substitution of synthetic food antioxidants by natural ones has fostered research on vegetable sources and the screening of raw materials for identifying new antioxidants. Special attention is focused on their extraction from inexpensive or residual sources from agricultural industries. Herein, the antioxidant activities of lignin obtained from 4 residual sources were investigated. The obtained lignin samples were characterized by different analytical techniques evaluating their chemical structure, phenolic content, thermal behavior and molecular weight. The antioxidant activity of the analyzed lignins was evaluated by the DPPH assay, the radical ABTS assay, and trivalent iron reduction method. It was found t that lignin antioxidants could scavenge free radicals and reduce oxidants. The high correlation between antioxidant capacity and its total phenol content indicated that phenolic hydroxyl groups were the main contributors to these lignins' antioxidant activity.

Food Research International					To make better use of cod head (Gadus macrocephalus), a by-product of fish processing, the effects of ultrasound pretreatment on the enzymatic properties and volatile compounds of cod head enzymatic hydrolysates were investigated. The results demonstrated that ultrasound pretreatment at 150-600 W had a positive effect cod head enzymatic hydrolysates. The soluble peptides content of the enzymatic hydrolysates reached the highest value of 5.31 0.16mg/mL at the ultrasound power level of 450 W, and the content of peptide molecules < 3-kDa was up to 93.96%. The type and relative content of volatile compounds, especially aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones, also increased with the increase the ultrasound power. The electronic tongue results indicated that ultrasound pretreatment reduced bitterness and astringency. The electronic nose results indicated that the hydrogen-and alkane-containing odor components in the hydrolyzed liquid after ultrasound pretreatment differed significantly from conventional enzymatic hydrolysates. In conclusion, ultrasound pretreatment may be applicable as a suitable technology to assist enzymatic hydrolysis of the cod head, and as such, promote the utilization of fish by-products.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Fructosyltransferase is a key enzyme in fructo-oligosaccharide production, while the highly demanding conditions of industrial processes may reduce its stability and activity. This study employs sequence alignment and structural analysis to target three potential residues (Gln38, Ile39, and Cys43) around the active center of FruSG from Aspergillus niger, and mutants with greatly improved activity and stability were obtained through site-directed mutagenesis. The Km values of C43N and Q38Y were, respectively, reduced to 60.8 and 93.1% compared to those of WT. Meanwhile, the kcat of C43N was increased by 21.2-fold compared to that of WT. These imply that both the affinity and catalytic efficiency of C43N were significantly enhanced compared to WT. The Glide docking score of sucrose inside C43N was calculated to be-5.980, which was lower than that of WT (-4.887). What is more, the proposed general acid/base catalyst Glu273 with a lower pKa value of C43N calculated by PROPKA might contribute to an easier catalytic reaction compared to that of WT. The thermal stability and pH stability of the mutant C43N were significantly enhanced compared to those of WT, and more hydrogen bonds formed during molecular dynamics simulations might contribute to the improved stability of C43N.										2022	70	23	7202	7210	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01699					FSTA:2022-11-Bc1871

Foods					Tan sheep are greatly preferred by consumers in China because of their nutritional value and unique flavor. However, the meat quality of Tan sheep has decreased due to the change in feeding systems from grazing to indoor. Studies investigating the mechanisms for the decrease in meat quality are limited. A total of 28 Tan sheep were randomly allocated to two treatments, receiving a concentrated diet, or pasture. Flavor precursors and volatile compounds were analyzed with foodomics. E-nose and E-tongue analyses suggested that the aroma and taste profiles differed between the feeding systems. The grazing lambs had higher levels of linoleic acid and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (p< 0.01). Metabolomics indicated that 25 hydrophilic metabolites active in glycolipid and amino acid metabolisms were changed by the feeding system. Among the 57 volatile compounds identified, methional, gamma-butyrolactone, benzaldehyde, and ethyl acetate were at concentrations significantly higher in the grazing lambs than the indoor-fed lambs (p< 0.01). These results reveal key changes in flavor precursors and flavor profiles affected by the feeding system, which may provide an initial view of the reason for consumer preference for the grazing Tan sheep. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Control					Cross-contamination of Listeria monocytogenes from raw to ready-to-eat (RTE) foods has caused a number of foodborne outbreaks. This study used the quantitative exposure assessment to analyze the transfer risk of L. monocytogenes from raw pork to RTE ham under different simulated food-handling scenarios (including different bacterial concentrations, cutting board materials, and cutting board cleaning methods). Results showed that, with the increase of temperature of cleaning water, the transfer rates from both pork to cutting board and cutting board to ham declined gradually, and cross-contamination could be avoided after the cutting boards in high concentration L. monocytogenes (HCLM) group were cleaned with tap water at 70°C, and at 50°C in the low concentration L. monocytogenes (LCLM) group. When the cutting boards were not cleaned, the contamination levels of L. monocytogenes transferred to ham through cross-contamination of wood, plastic, and stainless steel were 1.84 Lg (CFU/g), 1.76 Lg (CFU/g), 1.74 Lg (CFU/g), respectively in LCLM group, which were close to HCLM group (at 95% confidence level). These indicated that the potential risk of cross-contamination of meat contaminated with low concentrations of L. monocytogenes also needs to be elucidated. Overall, lower the initial contamination level of raw meat and the use of tap water of higher temperature to clean the cutting boards were observed to be effective in reducing the risk of cross contamination of L. monocytogenes in meat products.

Journal of Dairy Science					Protein-polysaccharide-polyphenol noncovalent ternary complexes possess unique physicochemical, structural, and functional properties. In the present study, ternary complexes based on whey protein concentrate (WPC; 2%, wt/vol) and high methoxyl pectin (HMP; 0.5%, wt/vol) complexes and 0.2 to 0.6% (wt/vol) chlorogenic acid (CA) or rosmarinic acid (RA) were formed and characterized at 3 pH values (4, 4.5, and 5). The pH conditions were decided according to phase diagram of WPC and HMP during acidification. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated that WPC-HMP complexes bound RA stronger than CA and the binding constant increased with increasing pH for both phenolic acids. Particle size of ternary complexes decreased and absolute zeta-potential increased with pH values changing from 4 to 5, and RA influenced the particle size of WPC-HMP complexes greater than CA. The CA and RA in ternary complexes showed good stability against UV light with pH order of pH 5 > pH 4.5 > pH 4. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectra indicated the involvement of hydrogen bonding between WPC-HMP and CA or RA. Antibacterial tests showed that ternary complexes had good antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli at concentrations of 6.2 mg/mL and the ability increased with decreasing pH values. All ternary complexes possessed strong scavenging radical capacities with median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 2.71 0.05 to 6.20 0.41 mug/mL. Antioxidative ability of ternary complexes increased as pH went up and WPC-HMP-RA showed significantly higher antioxidative property compared with WPC-HMP-CA. Data may provide useful information for rational design of ternary complexes and applications of the formed complexes in food matrices such as beverages and emulsions.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, the antifungal effects of 12 preservatives or disinfectants against Fusarium concentricum on asparagus spear, as well as their inhibiting characteristics, were investigated. Results. Showed that dehydrogenation sodium acetate at 0.5 g/L, sodium ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate at 0.3 g/L, sodium hypochlorite at 0.2 g/L, and cinnamic aldehyde at 0.4 g/L could completely inhibit the sporulation. The concentrations of cinnamaldehyde, sodium hypochlorite, H2O2, and ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate that completely inhibited spore germination were 0.1, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 g/L, respectively. High molecule chitosan (HMC) at 0.25 g/L and water-soluble chitosan (WSC) at 2 g/L could inhibit spore germination and 90% of mycelium growth. Moreover, asparagus treated with HMC or WSC at 0.5 g/L showed hyphae growth with no soft rot, which indicated that pectinase might be damaged. This results might provide an important basis for further study into the uses of preservatives for control of postharvest diseases of asparagus. Novelty impact statement.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Due to the side effects of synthetic ACE inhibitors like captopril used for the treatment of hypertension, ACE inhibitory peptides derived from natural sources have attracted increasing attention in recent years. The aim of this work was to screen the vegetable with the highest angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity from 50 kinds of vegetables by using three different extraction methods, and to purify and identify the novel peptides from broccoli protein hydrolysates and evaluated the ACE inhibitory activity in vitro. Through centrifugation, ultrafltration, gel chromatography and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), the fraction BHs-IV-I-IV of the enzyme hydrolysate of broccoli with 100% ACE inhibitory activity was obtained. The novel ACE inhibitory peptide (KSVLLKF, KF-7) was identifed from fraction BHs-IV-I-IV by ultra-performance liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). ACE inhibition rate of 0.05mg of KF-7 reached 42.86%, whereas 12.48mg of pepsin hydrolysate of broccoli crude extract only exhibited 55.29% of ACE inhibition rate, indicating the low content of KF-7 in the protein hydrolysates of broccoli. These results suggested that KF-7 has a potential application in functional foods/pharmaceutical agents against hypertension and protein from broccoli may constitute a potential antihypertensive peptide source.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The significant decline of flavor in modern commercial peach (Prunus persica L.) cultivars has become a serious problem for producers and consumers; therefore, understanding peach flavor is important for improving commercial cultivars. Here we analyzed the volatiles in the Four Nationwide Traditional Famous Peach of China, "Bai Hua Shui Mi," "Feng Hua Yu Lu," "Fei Cheng Tao," and "Shen Zhou Mi Tao", which are well known for their flavors and long cultivation history. We determined the major volatile groups and volatiles unique to and common among each cultivar. Eight odors were dominant in the peach aromas. We measured the expression levels of the genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes and transcription factors associated with the important volatiles. This revealed differences among cultivars in three volatile compound biosynthetic pathways: the beta-oxidation pathway (epoxide hydrolase genes [Prupe. 3G156700, Prupe. 7G041200] and acyl-coA oxidase genes [Prupe. 7G067100]); lipoxygenase pathway (lipoxygenase genes [Prupe. 4G047800, Prupe. 6G324100]); terpenoid pathway (phytoene synthase genes [Prupe. 3G013200, Prupe. 3G178500], terpene synthase genes [Prupe. 4G030300, Prupe. 4G030400], and zeta-carotene desaturase genes [Prupe. 6G340000]). Expression of a bHLH transcription factor (Prupe. 8G157500) was also associated with the important volatiles. These results provide a greater understanding of the aromas of these high-quality peach cultivars, which could contribute to efforts to improve peach fruit aroma.

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to evaluate the effect of inclusion complexes (ICs) on the oxidative stability of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) and microstructures in lamb during frozen storage. The inclusion process between apple polyphenols (APs) and hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) was verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and the antioxidant activity of APs. Results showed that the sensitivity of MPs to oxidation improved after 40 weeks. The ICs (0.2-1.6 mg/mL) significantly reduced the carbonyl content, particle size aggregation, protein degradation, fluorescence quenching effect, and decreased the alpha-helix contents loss of MPs. Additionally, the changes in protein oxidation showed a correlation with the microstructure of muscles, and the addition of 1.6 mg/mL IC remarkably improved the structure of muscle tissues while that of 3.2 mg/mL IC was detrimental to the structural properties. Overall, the exertion of antioxidant activity significantly influenced the cryoprotective effect of ICs on frozen lamb meat.

J		Yuanyuan Zhong; Yangming Liu; Lijie Xing; Mou Zhao; Wenxia Wu; Qingling Wang; Hua Ji; Juan Dong							Improving the quality of frozen lamb by microencapsulated apple polyphenols: effects on cathepsin activity, texture, and protein oxidation stability.		Foods					This study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of microencapsulated apple polyphenols (MAP) in controlling cathepsin activity and texture, as well as inhibiting protein oxidation and metmyoglobin formation in lamb meat during frozen storage at -18°C for 40 weeks. The effects of degradation in vitro on cathepsin and the microstructure in lamb were also evaluated. Results indicated that relative to the control group, the lamb treated with MAP exhibited increased cathepsin activity and inhibited metmyoglobin production. Textural characteristics, such as hardness and springiness, significantly changed (p< 0.05). Treatment with 0.2-1.6mg/mL of MAP effectively reduced the mean particle size, increasing the zeta potential, delaying the conversion of alpha-helices to random coils, and maintaining the integrity of the tissue structure. However, treatment with 3.2mg/mL of MAP damaged the protein structure. Degradation in vitro indicated that protein oxidation hindered the effect of cathepsin and was a dominant factor affecting protein during the frozen storage. These results demonstrated that microencapsulation can potentially be used for meat preservation and replace chemical antioxidants in the meat industry. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Bioscience					Edible fungi residuals are by-products from the preparation process of edible fungi hot pot soup seasoning. Enzymatic hydrolysate was prepared by cellulase (Cel), papain (Pap) and neutral protease (Nep) as well as their combination, and the reducing sugar content, the degree of hydrolysis (TDH), color, antioxidant capacity, inorganic elements and flavor of enzymatic hydrolysate were evaluated. The properties of enzymatic hydrolysate produced by compound enzymes were better than that of single enzyme, especially for the compound of enzymes Cel and Pap. The reducing sugar of enzymatic hydrolysate prepared by the combination of Cel and Pap increased 6.98 times and with TDH reached 25.80% 1.28%. In addition, edible fungi by-products after enzymatic hydrolysis exhibited yellowish-brown color with higher antioxidant capacity and little change of the volatile flavor. Enzymatic hydrolysate possessed a high retention rate of Na and Mg in the raw material, and there was no potential harm caused by excessive heavy metals (Cd, Pb, As).

J		Yuanyue Wu; Qianqian Ye; Ling Zhang; Zuxin Cheng; Kaijun Xiao; Liang Zhu; Yurong Yin; Hao Dong							Evaluation on antiosteoporosis of collagen peptides prepared by immobilized protease with eggshell membrane.		Journal of Food Science					Collagen peptides are a potential treatment for osteoporosis due to their antiosteoporosis activity. In this study, we prepared immobilized protease with eggshell membrane as carrier, and then hydrolyzed collagen to obtain collagen peptide. The antiosteoporosis of collagen peptides was confirmed by hBMSC osteogenic differentiation and bone mineralization improvement results. Surprisingly, antiosteoporosis of collagen peptides was related to the molecular weight of collagen peptides. This was derived from the osteoblast marker gene expressions, and mineral elements in P1 treatment were higher than those in P3 treatment. Consequently, these results confirmed that antiosteoporosis of low molecular weight collagen peptides is higher than that of higher molecular weight collagen peptides. Furthermore, the antiosteoporosis activity of P1 was due to its peptide sequences with known antiosteoporosis activity in P1. Practical Application. Using eggshell membrane as carrier to prepare immobilized protease was meaningful for solving the problem of resource waste. In addition, the results showed that collagen peptides possessed antiosteoporosis, and the effect of low molecular weight collagen peptides was better. This study provides a theoretical basis for developing high antiosteoporosis collagen peptides able to treat osteoporosis. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	6	2391	2404	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16172					FSTA:2022-10-Qa0625
J		Yubin Peng; Yang Sun; Xiaoang Wan							Influence of the crossmodal congruency between color and flavor on product evaluations: evidence from behavioral and oscillatory brain responses.		Food Quality and Preference					People often associate features or stimuli across senses, and these crossmodal correspondences also function as criteria for judging whether a pair of features or stimuli is crossmodally congruent or incongruent. We conducted two studies to examine whether the crossmodal congruency between a drink color and a flavor could also elicit more positive ratings of this drink. In Study 1, the experimental task was to simultaneously view a photo of a colored drink and to taste a beverage whose flavor was either congruent or incongruent with the color. Consequently, the color-flavor congruent drinks received more positive ratings than the color-flavor incongruent ones. In Study 2, we conducted an EEG experiment to investigate both behavioral and oscillatory brain responses to the crossmodal congruency between the successively presented color and flavor. The results of subjective ratings did not reveal any significant difference between the color-flavor congruent and incongruent stimuli. However, the time-frequency analyses on the EEG data revealed that rating the color-flavor incongruent beverages elicited greater alpha band power in the parietal region, compared to the color-flavor congruent stimuli. Collectively, these findings revealed the influence of color-flavor congruency on the subjective ratings of beverages, and demonstrated how this effect was modulated by the temporal synchrony of the color and flavor cues.

J		Yubo Ma; Jihan Li; Jingling Li; Li Yang; Guanle Wu; Shiyao Liu							Comparative metabolomics study of Chaenomeles speciosa (Sweet) Nakai from different geographical regions.		Foods					Chaenomeles speciosa (Sweet) Nakai (C. speciosa) is not only a Chinese Herbal medicine but also a functional food widely planted in China. Its fruits are used to treat many diseases or can be processed into food products. This study aims to find key metabolic components, distinguish the differences between geographical regions and find more medicinal and edible values of C. speciosafruits. We used ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and widely targeted metabolomics analysis to reveal key and differential metabolites. We identified 974metabolites and screened 548 differential metabolites from 8 regions. We selected significantly high-content differential metabolites to visualize a regional biomarker map. Comparative analysis showed Yunnan had the highest content of total flavonoids, the highest amounts of compounds related to disease resistance and drug targets and the most significant difference from the other regions according to the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform database, a unique platform for studying the systematic pharmacology of Chinese Herbal medicine and capturing the relationship between drugs, targets and diseases. We used oral bioavailability (OB) ≥ 30% and drug likeness (DL) ≥ 0.18 as the selection criteria and found 101 key active metabolites, which suggests that C. speciosafruits were rich in healthy metabolites. These results provide valuable information for the development of C. speciosa. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Yuceer, M.; Yildirim, G.; Caner, C.							The effects of sonication on the stability of eggs during extended storage.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The efficacy of sonication with different powers (80,160 and 360W) on fresh eggs for maintaining internal qualities such as pH, Haugh Unit (HU), yolk index (YI), relative whipping capacity (RWC), total solids, rheological behaviour and eggshell strength were investigated during storage at room temperature. Differences in significant (P<0.05) on HU and YI were observed between control and sonicated eggs after 1week. At 4weeks of storage, the albumen pH of 160W (9.40) and 360W (9.39) sonicated eggs were considerably lower than that of 80W (9.44) and control (9.54). At the conclusion of storage, the RWC of the 360W (857), 160W (847), and 80W (835) was substantially greater than determined for nonsonicated (control) eggs (RWC = 705). The lowest strength of eggshells (4.1kgf) was determined when the highest sonication power was used (360W) due to the effect of cavitation, which may cause micro-cracks that decreased the eggshell quality. Instead, the eggs sonicated at 80 or 160W maintained the eggshell strength for at least 1week of storage without any adverse impact. This study underlines that sonication, at the optimal power and treatment time, can be a viable nonthermal alternative method for enhancing the stability of eggs during storage. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).

J		Yuceer, M.; Caner, C.							Investigate the enzyme-texturized egg albumen on the functionality, sensorial and textural characteristics of cooked meringue cookies during storage.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this paper was to investigate the impacts of various of enzymes (phospholipase A2-PLA, protease and lipase) liquid egg white (texturized egg albumen-TMLEW) on physico-chemical quality, shelf stability and textural characteristics (water activity, color, specific volume-SV, texture profile analysis) and sensory profile of cooked meringue cookies during 90 days of storage at 23 2°C. Results showed that the SV of meringue samples for control (2.63 0.02) was lower comparing to PLA (4.17 0.01), protease (4.05 0.01) and lipase (3.92 0.02) treatments. The enzymatic treatments significantly increased the SV of cooked meringue (p<0.05). This research points out the optimum functionality and a shelf stable meringue was prepared by pre-treatment of TMLEW with lipase. The lipase was also improved the functionality of meringue mainly on specific volume scores, but lipase bring about a decrease in hardness values (softness) of textural profile while protease decreased sensorial scores. The organoleptic properties as experienced by the senses, including odor, flavor, appearance, and texture scores were highest in PLA treated TMLEW groups. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

J		Yucel, E.; Sivri, G. T.; Palabiyik, I.; Tasan, M.							A rheometer-based method to determine the crystal types of cocoa butter in white chocolate.		European Food Research and Technology					Understanding of cocoa butter crystallization mechanism throughout chocolate production is an important part to achieve the desired quality of chocolate. The alterations in the polymorphic composition of cocoa butter have a significant effect on the crystal stability and the tendency of the crystal to transition into other forms. In this study, rheological analysis by temperature scanning test used to evaluate characteristic gelling and melting properties, was applied to white chocolate samples which were melted at different temperatures (37°C, 50°C) and solidified at different storage conditions (25°C, 4°C,-18°C) as well as to solid white chocolate samples (control) which have not been melted at all. The goal was to determine the chocolate melting temperature by identifying the starting point (onset) of the descent of the prob gap as a result of the deterioration of solid phase of chocolate samples in the rheometer. The crystals contained in the solid white chocolate were not determined using any rheological method so far. However, in this study, the crystal types composing the main body of the three white chocolate samples were determined by rheometer. Consequently, the effect of melting and resolidifying of white chocolate on the possible cocoa butter crystal types throughout the storing process has been observed. Further evaluation has been made on the fatty acid profile of chocolate to detect whether the variations in crystal types is originating from fatty acid composition or not. It was found that palmitic acid, stearic acid and oleic acid are the dominating acids in white chocolate and there is no statistically significant difference between fatty acid compositions (p>0.05). ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

J		Yucel, E. E.; Kaya, C.							Effect of jam and marmalade processing and storage on the phytochemical properties of currant cultivars (Ribes Spp.).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, changes in phytochemical properties of different currant (red, black, Ojebyn) cultivars while processing them into jam and marmalade and throughout the storage were investigated. Total phenolics content (TPC), total antioxidant capacity (TEAC and FRAP), total anthocyanins (TA), polymeric color (PC), and hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) analyses were performed in fresh currant fruits at the beginning of the storage. Also, the same analyses were carried out on jams and marmalades at the end of 6-month storage period. Decreases were observed in TPC, TEAC, FRAP, and TA values of jam and marmalade samples of all types of currant varieties at the end of the storage. At the end of 6-month storage period, average TPC values varied between 405.74 and 657.51mug GAE/g; TEAC values between 9.47 and 19.07mumol TE/g; FRAP values between 7.97 and 17.44mumol TE/g and TA values varied between 26.08 and 341.09mug cy-3glu/g. Novelty impact statement. This study revealed that studied currant cultivars (Ribes Spp.) contain high levels of anthocyanins and other phytochemicals. Ojebyn black currant samples were determined to have the highest values among all types of currant jam and marmalade samples during storage. Overall, it is important that these highly nutritious fruits can be offered to consumers by processing them to products consumed in four seasons such as jam and marmalade. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Control					Outbreaks and recalls associated with foods containing spices suggest a need for risk assessment of Salmonella in spices. In this study, the survivability of SalmonellaEnteritidis PT 30, Salmonella cocktail (S. Enteritidis PT 30, S. tennessee K4643 and S. agona 447967), and Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 in chili, cinnamon and black pepper at water activities (aw) 0.3 and 0.5 were evaluated during one-year storage at 21°C. The thermal resistance of Salmonella cocktail in spices was also evaluated at 70°C before and after storage. At aw 0.5,4-month storage caused 5 log reduction of Salmonella cocktail in chili, while 8months led to the same level of reduction in cinnamon. But only 3 log reduction were observed in black pepper over one year. Storage at aw 0.3 caused less reduction in Salmonella cocktail during the same storage periods. Less than 2 log reduction of E. faecium were observed over the one year storage at both aw levels, except for in chili stored at 0.5 aw. The D70°C-values for Salmonellacocktail in chili, cinnamon and black pepper of aw 0.3 before storage were 15.4,20.8 and 36.6min, respectively. 21-50% drops in the D70°C-value were obtained after two-month of storage, mostly in chili and least in black pepper. The high D70°C-value in black pepper persisted over one-year storage. Based on these results, chili powder showed the highest antimicrobial effect, followed by cinnamon and black pepper powders during storage and isothermal treatments.

J		Yucetepe, A.							A combination of osmotic shock and ultrasound pre-treatments and the use of enzyme for extraction of proteins from Chlorella vulgaris microalgae: optimization of extraction conditions by RSM.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, the effect of a combination of osmotic shock, the use of carbohydrase enzyme and ultrasound waves was investigated on protein content (PC), total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AOA) by CUPRAC and DPPH methods of protein extracts from Chlorella vulgaris green microalgae. The extraction parameters (enzyme/substrate ratio (E/S), ultrasound probe time and extraction time) were optimized by using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) based on Box-Behnken design (BBD). According to experimental results, PC, TPC and AOA by CUPRAC method of the extracts ranged from 95.80 to 263.08mg protein/g dw, 9.68-33.06mg GAE/g dw and 17.69-34.52mg TE/g dw, respectively. Water absorption capacity, oil aborption capacity, emulsion activity, emulsion stability, foaming capacity and foaming stability of the proteins extracted under optimum extraction conditions (E/S of 0.87, ultrasound probe time of 119.30 s and extration time of 2.74 h) from C. vulgaris were determined as 12.19 3.84%, 455.44 5.30%, 208.11 0.22%, 73.10 4.68%, 49.17 5.89% and 26.36 1.29%, respectively. All these suggest that protein extracts obtained from C. vulgaris might be a good candidate to improve foods in terms of techno-functional properties. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Research International					The nutrition and functionality of Chenopodium quinoa Willd are closely related to its components; however, these properties vary widely in different varieties of C. quinoa Willd from different origins. Using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-field quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QE HF HRMS) for metabolomics analysis, we performed nontargeted metabolomics analysis of C. quinoa Willd of different color varieties and origins and evaluated the texture characteristics after cooking. Both the variety and origin significantly affected the metabolic characteristics of C. quinoa Willd. The differences in the composition and texture properties were closely related to the lipid, amino acid, and polyphenol contents. The contents of kaempferol, catechol, myricetin 7-(6′-galloside), tyrosine, prostaglandin I2, and glutathione in white, red, and black quinoa significantly differed, and the variety had a greater effect on the lipid content than on the polyphenol and amino acid contents. At the same processing level, the texture properties of white and red quinoa were better than those of black quinoa. Furthermore, the contents of differential polyphenols and amino acids in Gansu white quinoa were higher than those in quinoa from the other three producing areas. The contents of differential polyphenols and terpenoids in Inner Mongolia white quinoa were relatively low, whereas in Shanxi white quinoa, the contents of differential amino acids were relatively low and those of differential terpenoids were relatively high. The levels of quercetin and its derivatives, kaempferol and its derivatives, 9-HODE, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, elaidic acid, linoleic acid, prostaglandin H2, glutathione, 5-aminovaleric acid, and other compounds significantly differed in quinoa from different origins; thus, these compounds can be used as metabolic markers to identify the origin of quinoa. The texture properties of white quinoa from Qinghai and Inner Mongolia were better than those of white quinoa from Gansu and Shanxi. Although C. quinoa Willd can tolerate harsh environments, its grain quality varies widely. Cultivating C. quinoa Willd varieties according to local conditions is important for improving their yield and quality.

Food Research International					Eight lactating cows were used to determine the effects of citrus peel extract (CPE) on milk performance, antioxidant properties, and milk lipids composition. CPE supplementation up to 150g/d (CPE150) increased milk yield and the proportions of unsaturated fatty acids of conjugated linoleic acid. CPE with abundant polyphenol and flavonoids can transfer these bioactive substances to mammary gland and improve the antioxidant properties of milk obtained from cows. Lipidomics revealed that 56 lipid species were altered between CON vs CPE150, and there were five key differential metabolic pathways. In particular, milk phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylcholine were significantly increased with dietary CPE supplementation. In summary, our results provide insights into the modifications in the milk components and milk quality of dairy cows received CPE. The inclusion of CPE in the diet of dairy cows may be an effective and natural way to increase the antioxidant amounts and beneficial lipids in milk.

International Dairy Journal					Changes in physicochemical parameters and composition of Bactrian camel milk were evaluated at 1, 7, 21, 35, and 90 days postpartum. Bactrian camel milk contained 14.82% total solids (TS), 10.89% solid non-fat (SNF), 5.96% lactose, 4.73% protein, 3.88% fat, and 0.88% ash on average in an apparent negative trend. Density and refractive index (RI) volatility decreased as lactation progressed (pH increased 21 days postpartum, following a decrease) with a relatively stable decline in freezing point, electrical conductivity (EC), and acidity. The amino acid profile declined in relative proportions as lactation processed, represented mainly by leucine and glutamic acid, and methionine, cysteine, and glycine to a lesser degree. The fatty acid profile, predominated by C18:1n9c, C16:0, and C14:0, changed according to the lactation stages, especially the highest unsaturated fatty acids on 1st day. Understanding the physicochemical indicators and composition represents the basis for research and development of Bactrian camel milk.

Food Chemistry					This work aimed to evaluate the role of citral (Cit) in the formation of acrylamide (AA) in model systems. The asparagine (Asn) /glucose (Glc), Asn/Glc/ginger essential oil (GEO), and Asn/Glc/Cit model systems were prepared and analysed by UPLC-MS/MS. Cit was implicated to be a major product that contributed to the enhancement of AA formation by GEO. The addition of Cit significantly enhanced the formation of AA in the Asn/Glc model system in a dose-dependent manner. Further analysis showed Cit rather than its oxidation product played a major role in AA formation. Cit not only directly reacted with Asn via the Maillard reaction producing AA but also promoted the formation of AA between Asn and Glc. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and acrylamide (AA) are neoformed food contaminants. In this study, the simultaneous inhibition of HMF and AA by histidine (His) were investigated. In the asparagine (Asn) /glucose (Glc) model system, the inhibition ratios of HMF and AA were in the range of 28-58% and 0-71% when 20 mmol/L His was added. In cookies, His also exhibited excellent inhibition effects on both HMF and AA. At the His concentration of 2% (w/w), the inhibition ratios of HMF and AA reached 90% and 65%. Additionally, the sensory quality of cookies was not affected significantly. Qualitative results suggested that His inhibited the formation of AA by the competitive reaction between His and Asn for Glc, as well as directly eliminated the formed HMF and AA via the carbonyl-amine reaction and the Michael addition, respectively. This study revealed that His could be applied for the inhibition of HMF and AA in heated food.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soybean protein, especially glycinin, easily forms aggregates, limiting its application in some scenarios. In this research, the effects of different hydrodynamic cavitation (HC; 550 W for 0, 10 and 30min) treatments on soybean glycinin aggregation at different pH values (2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) were investigated. At the five pH values, HC decreased the emulsifying activity index with increasing HC treatment time; however, the effects on the particle size, surface hydrophobicity (H), solubility and emulsifying stability index (ESI) varied. Notably, HC had more significant effect on the physicochemical structure and functional properties at pH 6 than the other four pH because of different conformational structure, enhancing glycinin's H (from 850.95 59.03 to 988.43 64.68), solubility (from 21.85 0.23 to 63.62 1.18g/100g), and ESI (from 58.39 7.46 to 127.74 3.43min). Moreover, HC influenced glycinin aggregation, as demonstrated by the intrinsic fluorescence spectra and circular dichroism results. In conclusion, HC changed the aggregation behavior and improved the functional properties of glycinin, indicating that HC is a promising technique to improve functional properties and provides a reference for the application of soybean protein in the food industry.

J		Yucheng Wang; Min Yang; Juanjuan Qin; Wenqiang Wa							Interactions between puerarin/daidzein and micellar casein.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Puerarin (PUE) and daidzein (DAI) are polyphenols with extensive biological activities. In the present study, the interactions between PUE/DAI and micellar casein (MC) were investigated, and the physicochemical properties of their complexes were analyzed. The results of fluorescence spectrum analysis and molecular docking revealed that the main interactions between DAI and MC were hydrophobic forces, while that between PUE and MC was hydrogen bonding. The FTIR and XRD analyses confirmed the formation of complexes between MC and PUE/DAI. After binding to PUE/DAI, the size of MC increased. The weight loss rate of MC decreased after complexing with PUE/DAI, but its morphology was not extensively modified. The DPPH radical scavenging capacities of PUE-MC and DAI-MC complexes were higher than those of free PUE/DAI in both water and ethanol. In vitro release experiments showed that the release rate of PUE/DAI was inhibited by MC under simulated intestinal conditions. Practical applications. The low water solubility and poor bioavailability of PUE and DAI limit their application. Micellar casein has high affinity for PUE and DAI. After encapsulated by micellar casein, the release rates of PUE and DAI were prolonged during simulated intestinal digestion. The results would provide useful information for improving the solubility and bioavailability of PUE and DAI, and broadening the use of them in the food and pharmaceutical industry. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	2			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14048					FSTA:2022-05-Aj7999

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Process of Maillard reaction within 180 min was studied using Yak and Holstein casein-glucose models by indicators of free amino group consumption, content of H+, amount of intermediate products and browning intensity, while their kinetics were investigated. Intrinsic fluorescence property of casein during Maillard reaction was also measured. Structure and functional properties of Yak and Holstein casein-glucose Maillard reaction products were evaluated. The results showed similar profiles of free amino group consumption and H+ content against duration in both systems. Higher intensities of intermediate products and melanoidins were found in Yak casein-glucose system compared to Holstein casein-glucose system, as well as rate constant of browning accumulation. The kinetics of free amino group consumption and melanoidins formation for Yak casein were different from those of Holstein casein. Glycosylation improved emulsification, foaming, and oil combining capacity of both caseins, which is reached the best value at the ratio of 2:1 (glucose:casein, wt/wt). Novelty impact statement. The Maillard reaction process of Yak and Holstein casein-glucose models were investigated by different indicators, as well as their kinetics. Yak casein-glucose model has similar profile of free amino group consumption and pH change to those of Holstein casein, but higher accumulation of intermediate products and browning intensity.

The different types and brands of brick tea were processed respectively based on the PARAFAC factor scores and fluorescent data using four classifiers, including linear discriminate analysis, k-Nearest neighbors, partial least square discriminate analysis, and N-way partial least square discriminate analysis (NPLS-DA). The full fluorescent data combined with NPLS-DA showed the best classification results (96.5% for tea types and 98.3% for brands). In summary, the proposed methodology could be a potential tool for brand recognition of Anhua brick tea.

Food & Function					Weaning stress commonly damages the intestinal barrier of mammals, resulting in gut microbiota dysbiosis, intestinal illness, and even severe diarrhea. Probiotics are used as a nutritional strategy to promote the health of humans and animals and the gut microbiota balance. Here Wickerhamomyces anomalus was applied as a probiotic supplement to a weaned piglet model to investigate its impacts on growth performance, antioxidant capacity, inflammation response, and intestinal health. Supplemental 1g kg-1 108 cfu g-1W. anomalus 13611 significantly decreased the feed conversion ratio (FCR), alleviated diarrhea, improved the apparent total tract digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and gross energy (GE), increased the concentration of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and catalase (CAT) in serum, and decreased the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA) and pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) in serum. Importantly, supplementation of W. anomalus 13611 also improved the gut microbiota, decreasing the relative abundance of Oxalobacteraceae, enriching the relative abundances of Lactobacillaceae and Lactobacillus, and increasing the relative abundances of two species of Lactobacillus (helveticus and delbrueckii). In conclusion, W. anomalus 13611 could effectively promote growth performance and alleviate diarrhea in a model of weaned piglets, which may be related to improved antioxidant activity, anti-inflammatory response, and alteration in the structure of the gut microbiota. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	21	11223	11235	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01861f					FSTA:2023-02-Ad3513

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Finished oolong tea products with distinctly characteristic cultivar aromas generally have higher economic value. To advance our understanding of the aromatic differences between Camellia sinensis cv. Tieguanyin (TGY) and Jinguanyin (JGY) cultivars and their underlying formation mechanism, volatile metabolomics analysis, electronic nose (EN) analysis, sensory evaluation, and RNA sequencing were performed during this study. The EN and sensorial analysis showed a significant difference in odour characteristics between the two cultivars, which featured sweet floral and fruity aromas and green floral aromas, respectively. A metabolomics analysis of tea products showed that linalool (floral, OAV = 50.6) and geraniol (rose-like and sweet, OAV = 1.9) may contribute to the characteristic aroma. The volatile determination at each stage during the oolong tea manufacturing process emphasized that the significant difference in linalool and geraniol contents in fresh leaves from the two cultivars and the increase rate were potential reasons for their characteristic aroma and suggested that the "Tanqing" treatment clarified and intensified the characteristic cultivar aroma. A linalool synthase CsLIN with the expected catalytic activity was identified by coexpression network analyses. Collectively, our work pinpoints two key aroma substances within two cultivars and elaborates on the potential cause of characteristic cultivar aroma formation.

Food Chemistry					The combination of proteins and polysaccharides creates an exceptional platform for stabilizing biphasic systems such as oil in water emulsions. In this paper, we propose the use of natural protein-polysaccharide conjugates (PPCs) extracted from shiitake mushroom roots to stabilize high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs). The PPCs had bead-on-a-string nanostructures with bead (300 nm in diameter) and string (50 nm in thickness) structures corresponding to proteins and polysaccharides, respectively. Having spaced compartments with favourable amphiphilic properties, the PPCs had a three-phase contact angle close to 90°, which were harnessed for the preparation of HIPEs with excellent long-term storage stability (30 d) and heat tolerance (90 °C). The HIPEs were amenable to three-dimensional printing, yielding different objects with strong self-standing and high structural resolution properties. This paper presents a good example of how these unique PPC structures can provide biphasic stabilization, HIPE preparation, and potential applications in food products.

Food Chemistry					In this study, soybean oil-based oleogels were prepared using soy-protein isolate (SPI) and glycerol monolaurate (GML) in an emulsion-template approach. The rheological, texture, microstructure, and oil-retention properties of the obtained oleogels were analyzed. Results showed that the soy oil-based oleogel prepared with 6 wt% GML exhibited high oil loss, low-hardness, and needle-like morphology compared to the soy-oil/SPI-based oleogel. On the other hand, soy oil-based /SPI-based oleogels structured by 3 or 6 wt% GML presented moderate thermal-stability and lowest oil loss than those prepared without GML. Furthermore, SPI-based oleogel containing 6 wt% GML showed highest free fatty acids release (62.07%) with significantly improved elastic modulus and apparent viscosity. Additionally, the obtained oleogels displayed the occurrence of van der Waals interactions and intermolecular hydrogen bonds, presenting enhanced thermal stability. These results contribute to a better understanding of oleogelation-based emulsions for formulating trans-free and low-saturated foodstuffs with desired physical and functional properties.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to optimize the dark tea pile-fermentation conditions through single factor and orthogonal experiments. The optimal conditions consisted of 38 g/100g moisture content of wet green tea, 45 °C of temperature, and 85 g/100g humidity. On this basis, the dynamic changes of flavor components during pile-fermentation were systematically explored by chromatography, mass spectrometry and other methods. During pile-fermentation, changes were observed in the internal ratio of the following various substances, with a decrease in the content of tea polyphenols (especially ester catechins), amino acids, and soluble sugars, as well as the formation of new substances of theaflavin, thearubigin, and theabrownin, thereby affecting the brew color, flavor, and taste of dark tea. After pile-fermentation, a gradual decrease was detected in the floral aroma components, such as phenethyl alcohol, linalool oxides, and linalool, in contrast to a gradual increase in the content of aged fragrance components, including methoxy aromatic compounds like 1,2,3- and 1,2,4-trimethoxybenzene. During pile-fermentation, the important aroma substances such as benzaldehyde, beta-ionone, and dihydroactinidiolide showed an uptrend first and then a downtrend. The changes in the ratio of these substances contributed jointly to the aroma quality formation of dark tea.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Red-light withering (RLW) was shown to improve the aroma of summer-autumn black tea, probably due to the increase in the content of main floral aroma components. Analysis of the dynamic changes of volatile components during withering showed that RLW mainly played a role in the late withering period. Non-target metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze the main biosynthetic pathways of volatile components. RLW was shown to significantly up-regulate the expression of terpene synthesis-related genes (LIS, FAS, etc.) in the late withering stage and further promote the synthesis of volatile terpenoids (linalool and alpha-farnesene). Meanwhile, RLW leaves could release more leaf alcohol in the late withering period, due to the high expression of enzyme genes (LOX, ADH). Additionally, RLW could significantly increase the content of phenylethyl alcohol in the early withering stage. Moreover, the relative content of volatile bound glycosides (GBVs) did not change significantly among the three treatments (0 h, RLW9h and CK9h) after withering, suggesting that the hydrolysis of GBVs contributed little to aroma content during withering. Overall, RLW can significantly increase the activity of glycosidase in the later withering stage, thus improving the aroma quality of black tea in the subsequent processing.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					Electrospray (ES) technology is a novel non-thermal microbial inactivation method used in fruit wines. Long-term storage of commercial raspberry wine is possible due to its low microorganism count. Adding honey to commercial raspberry wine further improves its nutritional quality but can lead to microbial reproduction. This study investigated the changes in the microbes and the quality of honey raspberry wine after ES application. After undergoing ES, the total number of bacteria in the wine decreased from 4.21 to 2.03 log CFU/mL, the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) remained nearly unchanged, and the contents of ascorbic acid and anthocyanins were retained at 74.36% and 77.64%, respectively. The hydrocarbon concentration in aromatic compounds significantly decreased but did not affect esters and ketones, the main flavor substances in wine. Overall, ES treatment effectively reduced the microorganism load in honey raspberry wine while retaining its flavor as well as physical and chemical properties. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	1	177	189	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02755-3					FSTA:2022-05-Hj4521

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Enzyme inactivation is vital in fruit and vegetable juice processing, and selective inactivation is a major focus of enzyme inactivation. We used electrospray treatment to investigate directional enzyme inactivation in cabbage juice. Peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in cabbage juice are the enzymes causing deterioration, whereas myrosinase is a beneficial enzyme. The particle size distribution, zeta potential and secondary and tertiary structures of the enzyme proteins were evaluated before and after enzyme inactivation. After the electrospray treatment, the relative activities of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and myrosinase in the mixed-enzyme simulation system were 4.09%, 5.62% and 84.67%, respectively, and those in the cabbage juice were 6.68%, 5.24% and 77.34%, respectively. Additionally, electrospray treatment induced substantial aggregation of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in the mixed-enzyme solution, and the secondary and tertiary structures of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase were destroyed. Moreover, the conformation of myrosinase was preserved. These findings indicated that electrospray treatment can cause selective inactivation of peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase while preserving myrosinase activity.

J		Yucong Zou; Xiaofeng Li; Xuan Xin; Haixia Xu; Lan Mo; Yigang Yu; Guanglei Zhao							Comparative transcriptomics to reveal the mechanism of enhanced catalytic activities of Aspergillus niger whole-cells cultured with different inducers in hydrolysis of citrus flavonoids.		Food Research International					A new Aspergillus niger whole-cell catalyst was cultured for the cascade hydrolysis of hesperidin (HES) to produce high-value hesperetin-7-O-glucoside (HG) and hesperetin with high conversion (above 90%). Moreover, the inducers used were shown to be useful for cell growth and to induce cells to produce specific enzymes. Remarkably, the type of inducers determined whether the cells can hydrolyze HES. The product composition was also controllable by adjusting different inducers. Transcriptome analysis suggested that both naringin-vs-blank group and saccharose-vs-blank group had obviously difference in gene expression. The naringin-vs-blank group was mainly up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), while saccharose-vs-blank group was mainly down-regulated DEGs. The Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that whether naringin or saccharose was added as an inducer would greatly affect the catalytic activity of cells. Furthermore, 3genes related to rhamnosidase, 14 genes related to glucosidase and 5genes related to hydrolase activity were found. These genes were not only involved in rhamnosidase and glucosidase activities, but also spliceosome and the sucrose and starch metabolic pathways. The quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that the results of transcriptome sequencing were reliable. This study gave a new approach to hydrolyze HES, and new perspectives to understand the mechanisms associated with the hydrolysis of whole-cell catalyst.

Foods					This study was designed to explore the beneficial effect and mechanism of Ganoderma atrum (G. atrum) polysaccharide (PSG-1) on acrolein-induced IEC-6 cells. Our results indicated that PSG-1 significantly reduced the impairment of acrolein on cell viability, decreased oxidative stress, and enabled normal expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins that were inhibited by acrolein in IEC-6 cells. Furthermore, PSG-1 attenuated the elevation of microtubule-associated proteins light chain 3 (LC3) and Beclin 1-like protein 1 (Beclin 1) and increased the protein levels of phospho-mTOR (p-mTOR) and phospho-akt (p-akt), indicating that PSG-1 activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway and alleviated acrolein-induced autophagy in IEC-6 cells. Moreover, PSG-1 markedly attenuated the acrolein-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) expression, and the decrease in cysteine aspartate lyase (caspase)-3 and caspase-9. In addition, autophagy the inhibitor inhibited acrolein-induced TJ and apoptosis of IEC-6 cells, while the apoptosis inhibitor also inhibited acrolein-induced TJ and autophagy, suggesting that autophagy and apoptosis were mutually regulated. Taken together, the present study proved that PSG-1 could protect IEC-6 cells from acrolein-induced oxidative stress and could repair TJ by inhibiting apoptosis and autophagic flux, where autophagy and apoptosis were mutually regulated. © 2022 by the authors.

Food & Function					Chronic renal failure (CRF) is a result of the progression of chronic kidney diseases (CKD), a global health problem with a high cost of treatment and no ideal therapy. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pharmacological efficacy of the total flavonoids in Epimedium koreanum Nakai (TFE), a dietary supplement, against CRF and to determine the mechanism of actions. An adenine-induced CRF rat model and a TGF-beta1 induced human kidney proximal tubule epithelial (HK-2) cell based in vitro renal fibrosis model were established and used to evaluate TFE's efficacy. Renal hemodynamics, biochemical indexes, inflammatory cytokines, histopathology and the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were determined to evaluate the efficacy of TFE on CRF. NMR-based metabolomics, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, immunofluorescence (IF) staining, quantitative real time-PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were conducted to determine the mechanism. The results showed that TFE had a significant effect on CRF at 150 mg kg-1 d-1 and could significantly alleviate renal fibrosis in the animal model. Twelve potential biomarkers, which mainly involve energy metabolism pathways, for CRF were identified using the metabolomics approach. The mechanism study suggested that TFE regulated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) /acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and AMPK/silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) /nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways. Furthermore, the effect of TFE was inhibited by compound C in the in vitro experiment, which also confirmed the above conclusion. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	2	904	919	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03494d					FSTA:2022-05-Aj7928

Journal of Food Safety					Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the most promising biodegradable materials, which can reduce the environmental pollution caused by food and material industry. The effect of the addition proportion of nano-silver and different food simulant on the migration and the performance changes of film during migration were evaluated, revealing the association between the performance changes and nano-silver migration. The results showed that nano-silver had the largest migration amount and the fastest migration rate in 4% (v/v) acetic acid solution, followed by 50% (v/v) ethanol solution, and the lowest in isooctane solution. Performance changes were affected by the compatibility of silver nanoparticles and PLA, and the strength of the interaction between the film and acetic acid. Performances of composite film deteriorated during high proportions of nano-silver addition and long soaking. Adding a small amount of nano-silver to the composite was the effective method considering the balance between good performances and migration. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	42	3			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12974					FSTA:2022-10-Fe2201

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Volatile flavor, as one of the important sensory substance in apples, directly influences customers' choice and has attracted great attentions. In this study, representative "Fuji" apples (Malus * domestica Borkh.) from Xinjiang and Shandong regions in China were chosen to study the influence of production regions, skin varieties (blushed and striped) and bagging management on the volatile flavor. About 40 volatile organic compounds were identified, mainly including esters and olefins. Bagging management reduced the differences in apple aroma components not significantly, and little difference was caused by skin varieties. While the production region had a significant impact on the difference in volatile and aroma substances compared to bagging management and skin variety.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) and ultrasound (US) combination on the inactivation of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in vitro and in fish samples. The bacterial log reductions caused by the US and SAEW treatment for 15min were 0.99 and 2.63 log CFU/ml in vitro, respectively, while SAEW-US combination achieved a 3.10 log reduction. MTT assay and protein leakage test showed that SAEW-US combination impaired cell viability and damaged cell membrane. In addition, compared to the US or SAEW treatment, SAEW-US combination induced higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, more apoptotic cells, and severer damage in bacterial cells. In spiked sliced tilapia samples, SAEW-US combination caused about 2 log reduction of inoculated pathogen. In conclusion, these findings demonstrate that SAEW-US combination could be potentially developed as an alternative strategy to control V. parahaemolyticus contamination in aquatic foods. Novelty impact statement. SAEW-US combination effectively inactivates Vibrio parahaemolyticus, partly through inducing cellular ROS production, bacterial cell apoptosis, and microstructural changes.

Food & Function					Cancer stem cells (CSCs) function as the driving force of cancer initiation and progression. Wnt/beta-catenin is the core pluripotency pathway in CSCs, while its crucial regulator has not been fully elucidated yet. Here, we evaluated the role of ZO-1, a component of the tight junction protein complex, in colorectal CSCs, and found ZO-1 downregulation in both colorectal cancer cells and spheres. Over-expression of ZO-1 can inhibit the sphere-forming capacity and CSC marker expression in spheres. Immunofluorescence staining and co-immunoprecipitation analysis further revealed the interaction between ZO-1 and beta-catenin and the repressed role of ZO-1 in beta-catenin nuclear accumulation. Using in vitro and in vivo models, we suggested the suppression effects of sulforaphane on CSCs via the ZO-1/beta-catenin axis in colorectal cancer. The findings from this study depicted for the first time that ZO-1 dampened colorectal CSCs by interacting with beta-catenin and attenuated its nuclear translocation, providing new insights into the mechanisms and applications of sulforaphane in targeting CSCs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	23	12363	12370	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02932d					FSTA:2023-03-Aj5693

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Hydrogels synthesized from natural proteins have better biocompatibility than polymer hydrogels. In this paper, the hydrogels (referred to as tOVA/tGel@Ag) was developed using coordinative crosslinking of thiolated ovalbumin (tOVA) and thiolated gelatin (tGel) with silver nitrate. After thiolation with Traut's reagent, the free sulfhydryl group content of ovalbumin increased from 1.5mumol/g to 68.6mumol/g, and the molecular weight (MW) increased from 44.5 kDa to around 50 kDa. Then, the physicochemical and rheological properties of hydrogels with different tOVA/tGel ratios (10:0, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, and 0:10) were analyzed. With the decrease in the proportion of tOVA/tGel, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the network structure of hydrogel became more uniform and denser. Meanwhile, microrheological analysis displayed that the gel properties had been improved, which coincidently confirmed a better water-holding performance. During the antibacterial experiment, the diameter of the bacteriostatic ring of tOVA/tGel@Ag hydrogels against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) could reach 10.8mm and 10.3mm respectively, indicating their significant antibacterial properties. In summary, hydrogel prepared with thiolated proteins exhibited a good three-dimensional (3D) network structure with the help of silver ions, which was expected to play an important role in the field of food and medicine as antibacterial materials.

Using 10 evaluation indices, namely the scavenging capacity of 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS + ), hydroxyl (OH) and superoxide anion (O2-), the Fe2 + chelating capacity, the content of anthocyanin, flavone, soluble dietary fiber, reducing sugar and protein, antioxidant activity, and functional components of CCCP prepared by different methods were compared. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to establish a quality evaluation model of CCCP. Then, the effects of different treatments on the microstructure of CCCP were investigated. Two principal components (PCs) were extracted from PCA, with a cumulative contribution rate of 97.014%. In addition, the analysis of thermodynamic properties indicated that the initial gelatinization temperature of CCCP decreased after enzymolysis and fermentation and that it was easier to gelatinize. Particle size analyses revealed that different treatments could reduce the sample particles to different degrees. The average particle size in the three study groups decreased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that after different treatments, the samples were destroyed to different extents, which facilitated easy dissolution of active substances. Fourier-transformed-infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) revealed that the changes of CCCP functional groups after fermentation and joint treatment were more significant than those after enzymolysis. Practical Application. In this study, enzymolysis and fermentation techniques were used to improve the antioxidant activity and functional components of CCCP, and the effects of different treatments on the microstructure of CCCP were investigated. The bioavailability and nutrient composition of CCCP could be significantly improved by pretreatment, provide useful reference for the development of beneficial ingredients in cereal meal products and the application of different pretreatment methods. © 2022 The Authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Hexaconazole (HEZ) is a triazole fungicide registered to prevent and control grey mold disease on tomatoes. Many triazole fungicides exhibit plant regulator functions. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the effects of HEZ fungicides on the growth and development of tomatoes. In the present study, the effect of HEZ on healthy and Botrytis cinerea (B. cinerea)-infected tomato plants was investigated. We found that HEZ delayed fruit ripening when applied to healthy tomato plants and further changed the taste and flavor of these fruit. HEZ increased the size and prevented the rotting of the tomato fruit, thus saving grey mold infection-related losses. Moreover, compared with applying HEZ on healthy plants, the application of HEZ on B. cinerea-infected plants increased the metabolism of sugars, acids, and aromatic compounds in these fruit. Therefore, HEZ can effectively control fungal pathogens but reduce the quality of tomato fruit.										2022	70	13	3948	3957	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00109					FSTA:2022-08-Jj10895

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work prepared food-grade oleogel-based Pickering emulsion stabilized by ovotransferrin (OVT)-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) nanoparticles (OPEOC). The analysis of emulsified phase volumes and stability index exhibited that OPEOC with different volumes of oil fraction remained stable for 2 months of storage. The prepared Pickering emulsions were used as delivery systems for curcumin. In vitro digestive studies showed that OPEOC significantly improved the degree of lipolysis and the bioaccessibility of curcumin compared to the sunflower seed oil-based oleogel. The oleogel-based Pickering emulsions fabricated in the present study had noticeable storage stability, high loading and improved bioaccessibility of nutraceuticals, which might provide new insights into the development of novel food-grade Pickering emulsions with excellent properties.

J		Yue Gu; Jianjun Tian; Yue Zhang; Jing Wu; Yinfeng He							Effect of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-free supernatant on the physiology, quorum sensing, and protein synthesis of lactic acid bacteria.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the food industry, the competition and reciprocity between lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts in co-culture and the interactions of their metabolites affect product quality. Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication mechanism between bacterial cells, which participates in multiple physiological behaviors. The effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae YE4 cell-free supernatant (CFS) on LAB were explored from the aspects of growth and metabolism, QS, and protein expression. The results showed the CFS inhibited not only the growth of Enterococcus faecium 8-3 and Lactobacillus fermentum 2-1 but also their acid production and biofilm formation. The acid production and biofilm amount was significantly decreased by 18.4% and 12.8% in L. fermentum 2-1 and E. faecium 8-3, respectively. The effect of CFS on QS was shown in the changes of Autoinducer-2 (AI-2) activity, luxS and pfs genes expression. Moreover, a total of 136 proteins of E. faecium 8-3 differed significantly in co-cultured with CFS, which involved in metabolic pathways including oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, metabolic pathways, mismatch repair, QS system, two-component system, and ABC transporters. Therefore, S. cerevisiae YE4 CFS might affect the physiological metabolism of E. faecium 8-3 by affecting the energy metabolism and QS system.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					To explore the effects of wet milling method on highland barley flour and highland barley bread, we investigated the characteristics of highland barley flours and the quality of highland barley breads made from whole grain highland barley flour (WGBF), dry-milled highland barley flour (DBF) and wet-milled highland barley flour (WBF). Compared to other highland barley flours, WBF had lower damaged starch content (1.37 g/100 g), higher pasting temperature and higher gel strength. In addition, WBF with large particles exhibited low hydration performance. These properties induced a large specific volume (2.62 mLg-1) and good crumb structure of bread with WBF. However, due to the negative effects of damaged starch and insoluble dietary fibre in WGBF and DBF, the specific volumes of bread with WGBF and DBF (1.30 and 1.70 mLg-1) were lower than the bread with WBF. The results showed that WBF with high starch granules integrity could produce preferable highland barley bread. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	11	7275	7285	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16079					FSTA:2023-02-Mn1125

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to investigate the individual effects of rosemary extract and green tea polyphenols on the stability of the soybean oil-myosin emulsions with L-arginine or L-lysine. The results showed that L-arginine or L-lysine increased the physical stability of emulsion in all cases. In the presence of metallic cations, rosemary extract increased the physical stability, while green tea polyphenols decreased the physical stability. L-Arginine or L-lysine retarded the lipid and protein oxidation of emulsion in the absence of metallic cations during storage, but accelerated it in the presence of metallic cations. The two antioxidants delayed L-arginine-or L-lysine-induced lipid and protein oxidation in the presence of metallic cations. The results provide a new method for improving the physical and chemical stability of emulsion sausages in which L-arginine or L-lysine is applied to improve the quality attributes of emulsion sausage.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, it was aimed to determine the effect of microwave-assisted hydrothermal extraction (MHE) on the bioactive compounds, phenolic profile, and antioxidant activities of dateplum persimmon (Diospyros lotus L) juice and vinegar, compared to those prepared by microwave (ME) and hydrothermal (HE) extraction. Results showed that following optimization by response surface methodology, the total phenolic content of dateplum persimmon juice reached 166.8 2.2 mg/g at 131 °C, 26 mL/g, 390 W, and 32 min. The microstructural morphological changes to dateplum persimmon juice and their bioactive compound contents were ranked in the order of MHE-, HE-, and ME-prepared, and untreated juice from highest to lowest. Both MHE-prepared juice and vinegar presented high polyphenol, protein, and polysaccharide contents. Pyrogallol, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, quercetin-3beta-D-glucoside, ellagic acid, quercetin, maslinic acid, and ursolic acid were identified in juice and vinegar. Compared to untreated dateplum persimmon juice and vinegar, the IC50 values for the DPPH., ABTS.+, and .OH scavenging activities were decreased by 71.4% and 70.8%, 72.4% and 70.7%, and 50.2% and 48.3% for juice and vinegar prepared by MHE, respectively. These findings suggest that MHE can be used as a novel technology for preparing phenolic-rich and high-antioxidant activity juice and vinegar.

Meat Science					The effects of partial replacement of NaCl by KCl combined with other components on the structure and gel properties of porcine myofibrillar protein (MP) were investigated. Three salt substitute formulas were used: 100% NaCl (control, SF1), 70% NaCl + 30% KCl (SF2), and 70% NaCl + 20% KCl + 10% other components (SF3). The solubility, surface hydrophobicity, reactive sulfhydryl content, zeta potential, EAI and ESI of SF3 sample were significantly higher than those of SF1 sample (P < 0.05). SF3 reduced the alpha-helix content and increased the beta-sheet content (P < 0.05). Low field nuclear magnetic resonance showed that T21 and T22 of SF3 sample were shorter than SF1 and SF2 samples (P < 0.05), implying that SF3 reduced the mobility of mobile water and free water. Additionally, SF3 had a better gel water holding capacity, gel strength, and gel microstructure. Overall, partial replacement of NaCl by KCl combined with other components improves the physicochemical and gel properties of MP.

J		Yue Li; Yangling Wan; Yasmeen Mamu; Xinran Liu; Shuntang Guo							Protein aggregation and Ca2+-induced gelation of soymilk after heat treatment under slightly alkaline conditions.		Food Hydrocolloids					Alkaline heat treatment of soymilk is widely used in the production of soy products. This study aimed to clarify the effect of the thermal aggregation state of proteins on the coagulation characteristics of soymilk. Soymilk with different pH levels (6.6-8.0) was preheated, and the gelation processes induced by CaSO4.2H2O and the gel properties were investigated. Results. Showed that the aggregation and binding pattern of proteins changed after slightly alkaline heat treatment. The ability of 7S and the acidic (A) subunit of 11S to bind to the basic (B) subunit of 11S weakened. These subunits converted into non-particulate proteins, which decreased particulate protein content and particle size. The number of sulfhydryl groups on the protein surface reduced by 45%-62%, and more disulfide bonds formed in the protein subunits during recombination. During gelation, the soymilk after alkaline heat treatment exhibited a slow intermolecular binding in the "pre-aggregation" stage, which led to late gelation onset and a uniform gel network. With the increase in non-gelable protein content in the gel, the water holding capacity (WHC) enhanced and but the hardness decreased. When the pH was further increased (pH≥7.8) to the isoelectric point of the B subunit, the B subunit excessively aggregated and formed large and dense aggregates, which increased gel hardness and produced a rough and uneven network.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Sea cucumber-derived sulfated sterols exhibited more significant bioactivities compared to plant sterols due to the distinctive structure of the sulfate group at the C-3 position; however, their absorption, pharmacokinetics, tissue distribution, and excretion profiles are unknown, which limits the analysis of molecular mechanisms related to their unique activities. In this study, the absorption characteristics of sea cucumber sterols were determined by oral gavage administration, and their pharmacokinetics, excretion, and tissue distribution were studied by tail vein injection. The results showed that SS1 and SS2 reached the peak at 3 h (20.141.2 mug/mL) and 4 h (13.320.9 mug/mL) in serum, respectively, after oral gavage administration, suggesting the faster absorption rate of SS1 than SS2 due to the difference in the side-chain groups. Besides, lipid-containing food media improved the digestion and absorption rates of sea cucumber sterols. Moreover, SS1 exhibited a relatively longer duration of efficacy than SS2, and they were almost completely excreted within 9 h through urine. Additionally, sea cucumber sterols were found to be mainly accumulated in the liver (P < 0.05), followed by the kidney and spleen. These findings might provide a theoretical basis for the research and development of functional foods and nutraceuticals associated with sea cucumber sterols.										2022	70	2	480	487	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04218					FSTA:2022-05-Rg1963

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The magnetic nanoparticles plus microwave thawing (MNPMT), a new rewarming technology entitled "nanowarming", can serve as an effective method to achieve rapid and uniform thawing, thus reducing drip loss. The purpose of this study was to decipher the drip loss inhibitory mechanism of MNPMT in jumbo squid (Dosidicus gigas) from the perspectives of protein structure and ice crystal recrystallization. A number of different techniques such as dynamic rheology, Raman spectra, intrinsic fluorescence measurement, and ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra were conducted to analyze myofibrillar protein conformation and stability of jumbo squid. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and myofibrillar fragmentation index (MFI) were used to observe the growth of ice crystals. The interaction between magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and ice crystals was studied by using molecular dynamic (MD) simulation. Results. MNPMT exhibited the highest storage modulus (G') value at 90°C, suggesting the protein conformation was more stable. The increase in alpha-helices, fluorescence intensity and characteristic absorption peak of MNPMT illustrated that MNPMT can effectively maintain the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. Compared with cold storage thawing (CST) and microwave thawing (MT), the MFI value of MNPMT was significantly decreased (P<0.01). The result of MD simulation showed that MNPs displayed a tendency to gradually approach the surface of ice crystals, and induced a certain degree of damage to the ice crystal surface, thereby markedly inhibiting ice crystal recrystallization. Conclusion. MNPMT can reduce the drip loss by keeping the protein conformation stable and inhibiting the recrystallization of ice crystals during the thawing process. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	10	4313	4321	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11783					FSTA:2022-10-Re4221

Journal of Food Science					Selenium (Se)-enriched peptides were isolated from Cardamine violifolia by enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrafiltration. S3 (molecular weight [MW] distribution of 3-5 kDa) exhibited the strongest inhibitory effect on HepG2 cells and was thus screened using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay; it was found to have a high organic Se content. Its amino acid sequence was determined using HPLC-MS/MS. We then examined its ability to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and found that it arrested tumor cells in the S phase; moreover, it could induce cancer cell apoptosis. Following S3 treatment, we observed a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential and an increase in cell calcium content. Upon S3 treatment at 60 g/ml, the relative activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased by 1.48 times and 2.17 times, and the contents of PI3K and AKT decreased from 2.05 ng/L and 1.95 ng/L to 0.71 ng/L and 0.50 ng/L, respectively, when compared with the control group. Transcriptomic analysis revealed significant changes in the PI3K-AKT pathway following S3 treatment. This study thus established a foundation for additional development of Se-enriched peptides from C. violifolia as a functional food. Practical Application. Cardamine violifolia is a Se-tolerant cruciferous plant that can metabolically transform inorganic Se into organic Se that exists in the form of a selenoprotein. Se-enriched peptide obtained by extraction and enzymolysis of selenoprotein, as an organic combination of organic Se and peptide, possess valuable biological activities. In this paper, the effect of Se-enriched peptides of C. violifolia on tumor cells was studied via cell experiments, and its mechanism was preliminarily discussed, which should provide a theoretical basis for developing functional foods containing C. violifolia. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	7	3235	3247	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16199					FSTA:2022-11-Aj21328

Assessing the contribution of odor-active compounds in icewine considering odor mixture-induced interactions through gas chromatography-olfactometry and Olfactoscan.		Food Chemistry					The sensory impact of odor-active compounds on icewine aroma could be influenced by perceptual interactions with other odor-active compounds. The aim of this study was to establish an approach to evaluate the contribution of odor-active compounds found in icewine considering mixture-induced perceptual interactions. By comparing the impact of key odorants detected in icewine following a gas chromatography-olfactometry approach with an Olfactoscan-based methodology using a background odor of icewine, 69 odor zones were detected, and their related compounds were further identified. The results revealed that icewine background odor could exert odor masking or enhancement on key odorants when they are considered in the complex wine aroma buffer. Several compounds can induce qualitative changes in the overall wine aroma. This study underlined the efficiency of Olfactoscan-like approaches to screen for the real impact of key odorants and to pinpoint specific compounds that could be highly influential once embedded in the aroma buffer.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The research focuses on application of ultrasonic-assisted glycosylation in food protein modification. Biological activities and in vitro digestion characteristics of the glycosylated alpha-lactalbumin (UMGLA) and alpha-lactalbumin (UMLA) prepared by ultrasonic pretreatment and microwave heating at 85°C for 2 h were investigated mainly through the browning degree, free amino group, reducing sugar and surface hydrophobicity, in vitro digestibility and degree of hydrolysis, total antioxidant capacity, alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity, xanthine oxidase inhibitory activity determination methods. The results showed that ultrasonic pretreatment could effectively promote the occurrence of glycosylation reaction, reduce in vitro digestibility and degree of hydrolysis of glycosylated alpha-lactalbumin and enhance biological activities of glycosylated alpha-lactalbumin digestive products. Furthermore, after 60 min of ultrasound treatment, the total antioxidant capacity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of glycosylated alpha-lactalbumin digested products were increased by 76.520.02% and 12.420.04%, respectively, compared with alpha-lactalbumin without ultrasound treatment. In conclusion, ultrasonic-assisted glycosylation had positive effects on improving the biological activities of in vitro digestion product of alpha-lactalbumin. It provides a theoretical basis for ultrasonic-assisted glycosylation in the modification field of food proteins.

Food Bioscience					Coffee is one of the most important agricultural commodities and has the unique organoleptic characteristics such as strong but not bitter taste, fragrant, oily, and fruity. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics approach based on UHPLC-QE-MS was used to investigate the differences in terms of components of precursor metabolites in coffee beans from 18 producing regions worldwide. Fingerprint analysis, principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed a neat separation among coffee beans. Compounds with high relevance to variance in the projection values in supervised multivariate analysis were selected as important metabolites for the discrimination of coffee samples. In total, 10 different families of compounds were considered as potential markers of the coffee beans: 3-hydroxycoumarin, 4,5-di-O-caffeoylquinic, cryptochlorogenic acid, palmitic amide, linoleamide, arachidic acid, petroselinic acid, trehalose, L-glutamic acid, l-malic acid. The findings presented herein serve as a suitable framework for the design of novel discrimination strategies in food origin tracing.

Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, we analyzed and compared the fat globule interfacial compositions and structures in human milk and three types of infant formulas (IF1: supplied with MFGM, IF2: without MFGM and soy lecithin, IF3: supplied with soy lecithin). The results suggested that the interfacial protein composition of IF1 was comparatively closer to human milk, but still lacked certain bioactive MFGM proteins including XO, ADPH and PAS6/7. Considering the interfacial phospholipid, we observed 23, 31, and 29 phospholipid species that could be used to distinguish human milk and infant formulas (IF1, IF2 and IF3). We also found that phosphatidylinositol (PI) and phosphatidylserine (PS), which can absorb lipase, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and connect functional fatty acids, were lacking in infant formulas. Moreover, the infant formulas had a smaller average particle size of 0.38 mum and a thicker interfacial layer that interacted with the casein micelles. Even if IF1 included MFGM, fat globules structures like those found in human milk did not form, and the majority of the MFGM was still in the aqueous phase in free form. Overall, the comprehensive analysis in this study could be used to simulate or mimic human milk lipids at the supramolecular level.

J		Yue Qiu; Xinlu Chen; Jianyou Zhang; Yuting Ding; Fei Lyu							Effects of tempering with plasma activated water on the degradation of deoxynivalenol and quality properties of wheat.		Food Research International					Deoxynivalenol (DON) is prevalent in wheat and threatens the health of humans and animals. It has been certificated that plasma activated water (PAW) can effectively degrade DON in wheat. However, the application of PAW used in the production of wheat flours was not reported nowadays. Thus, PAW was used to replace pure water in the traditional tempering process to eliminate DON in wheat, and DON degradation effect of PAW was compared with H2O2 and O3. The DON degradation rate was 58.78 % by tempering for 24 h with PAW prepared at 50 kV for 10 min. The H2O2 and O3 were found to be critical contributors in PAW for DON degradation. Afterwards, effects of PAW on microorganism inactivation and wheat qualities were studied. After tempering with PAW, the bacterial and fungal counts, the number of surviving Fusarium graminearum in wheat were decreased significantly. Moreover, no negative effects were observed except a slight decrease in vitamin E content. Therefore, tempering with PAW can be a promising strategy to control DON pollutant in wheat.

J		Yue Qiu; Xinlu Chen; Zhangxi Chen; Xuejun Zeng; Tianli Yue; Yahong Yuan							Effects of selenium nanoparticles on preventing patulin-induced liver, kidney and gastrointestinal damage.		Foods					Patulin (PAT) is a toxic fungal metabolite, and oxidative damage was proved to be its important toxicity mechanism. Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) were prepared by reducing sodium selenite with chitosan as a stabilizer and used for preventing PAT-induced liver, kidney and gastrointestinal damage. SeNPs have good dispersibility, in vitro antioxidant activity, and are much less cytotoxic than sodium selenite. Cell culture studies indicated that SeNPs can effectively alleviate PAT-induced excessive production of intracellular ROS, the decline of glutathione peroxidase activity, and the suppression of cell viability. Evaluation of serum biochemical parameters, histopathology, oxidative stress biomarkers and activities of antioxidant enzymes in a mouse model showed that pre-treatment with SeNPs (2 mg Se/kg body weight) could ameliorate PAT-induced oxidative damage to the liver and kidneys of mice, but PAT-induced gastrointestinal oxidative damage and barrier dysfunction were not recovered by SeNPs, possibly because the toxin doses suffered by the gastrointestinal as the first exposed tissues exceeded the regulatory capacity of SeNPs. These results suggested that a combination of other strategies may be required to completely block PAT toxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Digitoflavone (DG) is a natural flavonoid abundant in many fruits, vegetables, and medicinal plants. We investigated whether DG inhibits lipid accumulation and inflammatory responses in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) in vivo and in vitro. The mouse ALD model was established by chronically feeding male C57BL/6 mice an ethanol-containing Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet. In vitro, mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) and mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with LPS/ATP, whereas HepG2 cells and mouse primary hepatocytes were treated with ethanol. DG reduced the serum levels of transaminase and serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides and malondialdehyde in ALD mice. DG downregulated SREBP1 and its target genes and upregulated PPARalpha and its target genes in the liver of mice with ALD. DG inhibited TLR4-mediated NLRP3 inflammasome activation, consequently reversing the inflammatory response, including the production of HMGB1, IL-1beta, and IL-36gamma, as well as the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils. DG blocked NLRP3/ASC/caspase-1 inflammasome activation and HMGB1 release in LPS/ATP-stimulated MPMs. When Tlr4 was knocked in LPS/ATP-stimulated BMDMs, HMGB1 production and release were blocked, and NLRP3-mediated cleavage and release of IL-1beta was suppressed in Hmgb1-silenced BMDMs. DG amplified these inhibitory effects in Tlr4 or Hmgb1 knockdown BMDMs. In ethanol-exposed hepatocytes, DG reduced lipogenesis and promoted lipid oxidation by inhibiting the HMGB1-TLR4 signaling pathway while suppressing the inflammatory response induced by ethanol exposure. Our data demonstrated that DG inhibited the occurrence of lipid accumulation and the inflammatory response via the HMGB1-TLR4 axis, underscoring a promising approach and utility of DG for the treatment of ALD.										2022	70	9	2968	2983	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00195					FSTA:2022-07-Aj11603

Food Bioscience					Agaricus bisporus mushrooms contain high levels of ergosterol (3-8mg/g dw), which can be converted into vitamin D2 (VD2) under ultraviolet irradiation (UV). However, the photoconversion of ergosterol can also lead to the production of inactive photoisomers decreasing the production yield of VD2. This study assesses the impact of UV irradiation conditions on the conversion of ergosterol into vitamin D2. The effects of various parameters were tested including the mushroom form (powder, extract, suspension), irradiation time (0-240min), temperature (20-40°C), intensity (0.16-0.48mW/cm2), and agitation during UV-C irradiation. The mushroom extract was the most suitable mushroom form for VD2 production. Beyond VD2, other photoisomers (tachysterol and lumisterol), were detected through HPLC-APCI-MS and their levels increased with deep and prolonged irradiation. The highest VD2 levels (0.95-1.03mg/g dw) were obtained by irradiating mushroom extracts with an intensity of 0.31mW/cm2 for 10min. These results highlight the potential of mushrooms for VD2 production through UV-C irradiation, which is accompanied by the formation of biologically-active photo-isomers.

Food Chemistry					The metabolic fate of dietary compounds is closely related to their biological functions. Pterostilbene (PT) is a methylated stilbene found in many plant foods. Herein, we investigated gastrointestinal biotransformation and tissue distribution of PT in mice fed with 0.05% PT (w/w) for 5 weeks. PT and its major metabolites i.e. PT sulfate (PT-S), pinostilbene, pinostilbene sulfate, hydroxylated PT and hydroxylated PT sulfate were identified and quantified in the mucosa and content of the digestive tissues, blood, urine and vital organs. The results showed PT underwent demethylation, hydroxylation and conjugation in the small intestine, while the conjugated metabolites were largely deconjugated in the colon. Anaerobic fermentation with mouse cecal bacteria demonstrated the microbiota mediated deconjugation and demethylation of PT-S and PT, respectively. In conclusion, oral consumption of PT led to extensive biotransformation in mouse gastrointestinal tract and the metabolites of PT might play important roles in the bioactivity of PT.

J		Yue Sun; Wenting Tang; Chuanfen Pu; Risheng Li; Qingjie Sun; Hongcai Wang							Improved stability of liposome-stabilized emulsions as a co-encapsulation delivery system for vitamin B2, vitamin E and beta-carotene.		Food & Function					To realize the co-encapsulation of multiple nutraceuticals with different solubilities, Pickering emulsions stabilized by freshly-prepared liposome suspension stabilized emulsion (Fre-Lip-Sus-E) and hydrated lyophilized liposome stabilized emulsion (Hyd-Lyo-Lip-E) were prepared, in comparison with the phospholipid stabilized emulsion (Pho-E). The particle size, zeta-potential, emulsification activity (EAI), emulsion stability (ESI), morphology, environmental stability and rheological properties of the three emulsions were compared. In addition, the in vitro digestive stability and bioaccessibility of three emulsions loaded with vitamin B2, vitamin E and beta-carotene were assessed. The results showed that the Fre-Lip-Sus-E and Hyd-Lyo-Lip-E were characterized by smaller particles and higher environmental stability than the Pho-E. The slight difference between the Hyd-Lyo-Lip-E and Fre-Lip-Sus-E might be due to the partial destruction of the phospholipid bilayer during the lyophilization of lyophilized liposomes. Rheological analysis demonstrated that all emulsions had high interfacial viscosity and significant shear thinning characteristics of pseudoplastic fluids. Compared with the Pho-E, the liposome-stabilized emulsions demonstrated good environmental stability and antioxidant properties, and the Fre-Lip-Sus-E and Hyd-Lyo-Lip-E exhibited comparable stabilising effects. Higher bioaccessibility of vitamin B2 and vitamin E in the Fre-Lip-Sus-E and Hyd-Lyo-Lip-E was observed, while beta-carotene had higher bioaccessibility in Pho-E. These results provide valuable insight into the potential for designing emulsion co-encapsulation delivery systems using liposomes as stabilizers. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	5	2966	2984	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03617c					FSTA:2022-06-Aj10370

Food Research International					This study aimed to identify differences of lipidome and fatty acid composition among human, bovine and caprine milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) using a lipidomics approach. In total, 11 lipid classes were determined, including PC, PE, SM, PG, PI, PS, Cer, PA, HexCer, Hex2Cer and CL. Using positive and negative ionization modes, 73 and 156 common significantly differential lipid species were identified in three typical MFGM. The oleic acid (C18:1) was the dominant fatty acid in human (28.29 0.04 g/100 g) and caprine (35.71 0.02 g/100 g) MFGM, whereas Palmitic acid (C16:0, 29.13 0.07 g/100 g) was the dominant fatty acid in bovine MFGM. In addition, there was no significant difference in long chain fatty acids between human MFGM and caprine milk. Overall, the results provide essential insights into differential lipids characterization in MFGM, along with a theoretical basis for the design of new infant formula.

International Dairy Journal					In this study, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) communities in 68 samples of spontaneously-fermented dairy products from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan were investigated using traditional culture methods combined with PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology. In the 518 LAB strains isolated using the culture-dependent method, the dominant species was Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus. A total 75 species of LAB were identified using SMRT sequencing; amongst these Lactobacillus delbrueckii (50.85%) was the predominant species. We compared the LAB communities from different countries (Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan) and different milk sources (fermented cows' milk, fermented mares' milk, cheese). Our results showed that variation in LAB communities from spontaneously-fermented dairy products from Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan depended on geographical location. These data provide the basis for development and use of LAB resources. Moreover, this study provides new insights that can be applied in starter culture development as well as microbial functionality studies.

Food Chemistry					The colorimetric method can determine the initial results even by the naked eyes, but its main challenge for antibiotics detection in food at present is the relatively low sensitivity. Herein, an ultrasensitive colorimetric biosensor based on G-quadruplex DNAzyme was firstly proposed for the rapid detection of trace tetracycline antibiotics like tetracycline, oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline and doxycycline. DNAzyme composed of hemin and G-quadruplex has peroxidase-like activity, and tetracyclines can combine with hemin to form a stable complex and reduce catalytic activity, making the color of solution changes from yellow to green. The limits of detection (LOD) of the proposed colorimetric biosensor for tetracyclines is determined as low as 3.1 nM, which is lower than most of the other colorimetric methods for antibiotics detection. Moreover, the average recovery range of tetracyclines in actual samples is from 89% to 99%, indicating that such strategy may has bright application prospects for tetracyclines detection in foods.

J		Yue Tang; Hongyan Yu; Xiaojuan Niu; Qiaodie Wang; Yuanyuan Liu; Yuangen Wu							Aptamer-mediated carbon dots as fluorescent signal for ultrasensitive detection of carbendazim in vegetables and fruits.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Pesticide residues like carbendazim have always been a great threat to agricultural production and food safety. Herein, a fluorescent aptasensor for carbendazim detection was established based on aptamer-mediated quenching of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) toward carbon dots (CDs). CZ-13 aptamer can wrap AuNPs and make them dispersed in salt solution, thus quench the fluorescence of CDs. On adding carbendazim, the aptamer is firstly consumed to preferentially combine with pesticides, resulting in the fluorescence recovery of CDs from quenching status. The degree of fluorescence recovery is positively correlated with pesticide concentration, which enables us to establish a fluorescence aptasensor for carbendazim detection. Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection of the fluorescent aptasensor is determined as low as 2.3mug.L-1. Moreover, the average recovery range of carbendazim in several vegetables and fruits is from 86 % to 99 %, indicating that such aptasensor may have bright application prospects for carbendazim detection in foods.

Journal of Functional Foods					The beneficial effects of Lactobacillus plantarum LP104 was investigated on lipid level and the disordered gut microbiota of HFD feeding C57BL/6N mice. C57BL/6N mice were divided into three groups, ordinary diet (Control), high-fat diet (HFD) and HFD with LP104, respectively. After 8 weeks, LP104 alleviated the body weight, liver index, colon length, TC, TG, LDL, TNFalpha and LPS levels. High-throughput sequencing analysis has found that long-term HFD destroy microbial abundance and composition in the gut. Nevertheless, dietary supplementation of LP104 reduced the ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroides and regulate the gut microbiota community structure positively. Meanwhile, the intake of LP104 also increased the abundance of beneficial bacteria Bifidobacterium in the cecum, which improves the intestinal flora disorder induced by a high-fat diet. The present study shows that LP104 supplementation improved the amelioration HFD induced hyperlipidemia by positively regulating intestinal microorganisms.

J		Yue Wang; Ji'en Wu; Hongshun Yang							Comparison of the metabolic responses of eight Escherichia coli strains including the "big six" in pea sprouts to low concentration electrolysed water by NMR spectroscopy.		Food Control					The antimicrobial effects of low concentration electrolysed water (LcEW) on common foodborne pathogens have been well documented; however, the effects on six emerging Escherichia coli serotypes (the "big six") remained unknown. Using pea sprouts as the food matrix, this in vivo study examined the sanitising efficacy of a 10-min LcEW treatment against eight E. coli strains (non-pathogenic E. coli ATCC 25922, pathogenic E. coli O26:H11, O45:H2, O103:H11, O111, O121:H19, O145 and O157:H7). The metabolic responses of the strains were further analysed using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. An overall negative correlation between the resistance to LcEW and the magnitude of metabolic variation was observed. The metabolic status and pathways of the most resistant O103:H11 and O45:H2 strains were the least affected. The O26:H11 and O145 strains which demonstrated the highest sensitivity to LcEW had an array of metabolites depleted and had multiple pathways involved in amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism as well as osmotic and oxidative protection perturbed. Distinctive metabolic responses were detected in ATCC 25922, suggesting that alternative stress defence mechanisms may be present in the non-pathogenic E. coli strain. Amongst the pathogenic strains, the most unique metabolic responses were illustrated by O121:H19. Overall, the study showed that the NMR-based metabolomics is promising in elucidating the metabolic changes of various E. coli strains in pea sprouts during an antimicrobial process. It also provides clue for controlling "big six" contamination in fresh produce.

J		Yue Wang; Hongshun Yang							Metabolomics elucidating the effect of water activity on the thermal resistance of Salmonella in wheat flour.		Food Research International					With mounting evidence indicating an enhanced thermal resistance of Salmonella at lower aw, the effectiveness of thermal treatment in wheat flour decontamination is challenged. Therefore, this study was carried out to evaluate the thermal resistance of three Salmonella strains, including Enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Typhimurium (ATCC 14028) and Newport (ATCC 6962), at 65°C in wheat flour at three aw levels (0.33,0.53 and 0.69), and to explore the mechanisms of the difference in thermal resistance via nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics. The results showed that except for the insignificant difference between the reductions of S. Newport at 0.53 and 0.69 flour aw (P> 0.05), a remarkable decreasing trend in Salmonella cell reduction with decreasing flour aw was observed after the 20-min thermal treatment. By comparing the metabolic profiles of each strain recovered from the lower-aw (0.33 or 0.53) flour with that from the aw-0.69 flour, the metabolic differences implying more efficient misfolded protein degradation, higher availability of amino acids as osmoprotectants, larger throughput of energy production by ATP synthase as well as wiser glucose allocation in the metabolic network were suspected to contribute to the strains" enhanced thermal resistance. Overall, the study adds to the evidence for the effect of lower aw in increasing the thermal resistance of Salmonella in wheat flour. Meanwhile, the identified discriminative metabolic pathways may be artificially modified in the future to help ease Salmonella inhibition during cooking or any types of thermal treatments.

J		Yue Wang; Xianfu Gao; Hongshun Yang							Integrated metabolomics of "big six" Escherichia coli on pea sprouts to organic acid treatments.		Food Research International					Naturally occurring organic acids (OAs) have demonstrated satisfactory effects in inhibiting common pathogens on fresh produce; however, their effectiveness on "big six" Escherichia coli serotypes, comprised of E. coli O26:H11, O45:H2, O103:H11, O111, O121:H19 and O145, remained unaddressed. Regarding this, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS), the sanitising efficacy and the underlying antimicrobial mechanisms of 10-min treatments with 0.2mol/L ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA) and malic acid (MA) against the "big six" strains on pea sprouts were thoroughly investigated in this study. Despite the varying antimicrobial efficacy (AA: 0.12-0.99, CA: 0.36-1.72, MA: 0.75-3.28 log CFU/g reductions), the three OAs induced consistent metabolic changes in the E. coli strains, particularly in the metabolism of membrane lipids, nucleotide derivatives and amino acids. Comparing all strains, the most OA-resistant strain, O26 (0.36-1.12 log CFU/g reductions), had the largest total amino acids accumulated to resist osmotic stress; its ulteriorly suppressed cell activity further strengthened its endurance. In contrast, the lowest OA-resistance of O121 (0.99-3.28 log CFU/g reductions) might be explained by the depletion of putrescine, an oxidative stress regulator. Overall, the study sheds light on the effectiveness of a dual-platform metabolomics investigation in elucidating the metabolic responses of "big six" E. coli to OAs. The manifested antimicrobial effects of OAs, especially MA, together with the underlying metabolic perturbations detected in the "big six" strains, provided scientific basis for applying OA treatments to future fresh produce sanitisation.

J		Yue Wei; Haotian Lou, N.; Zhixiang Cai; Ruiqi Li; Hongbin Zhang							Carboxymethylated corn fiber gums efficiently improve the stability of native and acidified aqueous pea protein dispersions.		Food Hydrocolloids					The application of pea protein in beverages has been limited because of its poor solubility and stability in water. We previously revealed that corn fiber gum (CFG) could effectively improve the stability of pea protein dispersions (PPD) only at high CFG concentrations (>10%). In addition, the high viscosity of the resulting PPD might lead to a poor mouthfeel. This successive work aimed to prompt the stabilizing performance of CFG for low-viscosity PPD with a refreshing taste using carboxymethylated CFG (CMCFG). The stabilizing effects of CMCFG with different degrees of substitution (DS) were investigated at native pH (6.5-7.5) and acidified pH (ca. 3.5). Results showed that CMCFG with suitable DS could well stabilize PPD at a low concentration of 5% at native pH and 3% at pH 3.5. Concomitantly, the viscosities of the CMCFG-stabilized PPD were decreased by more than one order compared with those of PPD stabilized by CFG. Carboxymethylation of CFG enhanced the electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance among protein/polysaccharide complexes, which contributed to the better stabilizing performance of CMCFG than that of native CFG. These findings indicated that CMCFG could be a potential stabilizer in pea protein-based beverage formulations.

Food Chemistry					Colletotrichum asianum (C. asianum) is a new pathogenic fungus that causes mango anthracnose. Cold plasma is a novel non-thermal decontamination technology, which has been proven to be effective in controlling postharvest fungus. Herein, dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was used to treat C. asianum spores in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, the damages in subcellular structures of C. asianum and inhibition of mango anthracnose were evaluated. Results showed that after 9min treatment, the spore germination rate and spore viability were decreased by 95.48% and 98.82%, respectively, and the subcellular structures were damaged (P<0.05), leading to spores death. Besides, DBD plasma treatments could control mango anthracnose and maintain mango quality, and the disease incidence and lesion diameter of mango treated for 9min were decreased by 48.00% and 62.95%, respectively. Therefore DBD plasma inactivated C. asianum spore, providing an alternative technique for preventing and controlling mango anthracnose.

Food Quality and Preference					Objective. This study aimed to evaluate the frequency of major food intake in toddlers with different severities of food neophobia and explore associations between food neophobia and the consumption of vegetables, fruit, snacks, and sugary sweetened beverages (SSBs) Method. This cross-sectional study included 747 toddler-caregiver dyads. Caregivers completed the questionnaire, which include the Child Food Neophobia Scale (CFNS), food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and questions regarding their toddlers' food refusals and reasons for refusal. Results. The mean CFNS score of the toddlers was 21.498.10, and the proportion of children with a high level of food neophobia was 27.4% in the overall sample. Children with high-level food neophobia consumed vegetables and fruits less frequently and thus had lower dietary diversity scores, while having a higher intake of snacks and SSBs. Leafy and flowering vegetables, meat and poultry, and cucurbitaceous vegetables were the top three rejected foods among high food neophobia toddlers. Such refusals might be due to the odor and taste, difficulty to chew, and texture of these foods. Conclusion. Early intervention is needed to address the high prevalence of food neophobia and thus improve Chinese children's dietary quality.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The advantages of epigallocatechin gallate incorporated in agar oligosaccharide treatment during post-mortem storage on ice for maintaining the quality and proteome stability of sea bass muscle was investigated using hardness, total volatile basic nitrogen, total viable counts, protein biochemical properties and label-free proteomic analysis. The results indicated that hardness value and sulfhydryl content of EGCG-AO-treated fish muscle were much higher than those of the samples immersed in sterile water. The total volatile basic nitrogen, total viable counts, and carbonyl content increased to 165.65%, 18.93%, and 42.37%, respectively after 8 days of storage. Proteomic analysis of muscle samples from control fillets on days 0 (CK0) and 8 (CK8), and EGCG-AO-treated fillets on day 8 (T8) revealed 708 different abundant proteins (DAPs). DAPs in CK8 vs. CK0 fillets were mainly structural proteins, metabolic enzymes, and proteins involved in protein turnover, and were closely related with freshness properties. Muscles from fillets in T8 showed delayed degradation of structural proteins, lower abundance of calpain and carbohydrate metabolic enzymes, and maintained higher levels of transcription and translation to maintain quality. Thus, EGCG-AO treatment is a possible method for maintaining freshness of sea bass fillets. Several DAPs are potential proteomic markers for monitoring fillet freshness.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Litchi downy blight caused by Peronophythora litchii is one of the most devastating diseases in litchi fruit, and developing safe and effective anti-pathogenic agents is required. This study aimed to investigate the inhibitory effects and related mechanisms of apple polyphenols (AP), naturally occurring products, on P. litchii in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that AP inhibited mycelial growth and sporangia germination of P. litchii in vitro in dose-dependent manner. Moreover, plasma membrane integrity of P. litchii was severely damaged by AP treatment at 5g L-1, which could account for the leakage of reducing sugar and soluble protein during incubation of pathogen. The destruction of P. litchii due to AP exposure was further confirmed by ultrastructural observation. Microscopic image displayed that AP induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in P. litchii at early stage of treatment. Proteomic results exhibited that mitochondrion-related proteins in P. litchii were down-regulated by AP, which resulted in decreases in respiration rate and ATP production, consequently contributing to compromised pathogenicity of this pathogen. In vivo test demonstrated that 5g L-1 AP delayed the disease development of litchi downy blight in P. litchii-inoculated litchi fruit. Suppression of disease in P. litchii-inoculated litchi fruit due to AP treatment was associated with reinforcement of host resistance, as indicated by enhanced activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and beta-1,3-glucanase (GLU), upregulated expressions of LcPAL and LcGLU and more accumulations of total phenolics and flavonoids in AP-treated fruit. The results suggest that AP application could ameliorate the occurrence of litchi downy blight by both the direct inhibition on P. litchii and the elicitation of resistance in litchi fruit.

Food & Function					Strenuous exercise is reported to provoke deleterious consequences including cardiac impairments, while the detailed mechanisms and effective interventions remain limited. The current study aims to explore the profitable effects of hydroxytyrosol (HT), one of the most abundant polyphenols derived from olive oil, on strenuous exercise-induced pathological changes in the heart and its underlying mechanisms. Sprague-Dawley male rats at the age of 8-week-old were supplemented with 25mg kg-1 day-1 of HT 45min before the beginning of strenuous exercise for a total of 8 weeks. HT treatment obviously improved the heart weight and morphology with lowered serum cardiac hypertrophy markers as well as cardiac oxidative stress. Moreover, the down-regulated mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, impaired mitochondrial complex activity, dysregulated expression of mitochondrial dynamics-related proteins and activated apoptotic pathway induced by Exe were all improved by HT. In vitro, 10muM HT effectively reduced the reactive oxygen species level, promoted mitochondrial biogenesis, and inhibited apoptosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in an angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy model. In addition, knockdown of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha, the key regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis, partially abolished the benefits of HT. Our results demonstrate that the disturbance of mitochondrial homeostasis plays a substantial role in strenuous exercise-induced pathological cardiac hypertrophy, and HT presents as an effective intervention strategy targeting mitochondrial homeostasis for cardiac health. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	16	8676	8684	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00839d					FSTA:2022-12-Ne2714

Food Hydrocolloids					The present work aimed to explore nanofibrils prepared from whey protein isolate (WPNFs) by hydrothermal to stabilize high internal phase Pickering emulsion (HIPPEs). WPNFs with well-ordered beta-sheet structures and high aspect ratio were efficiently prepared by hydrothermal at 110 °C for 4 h, which is more efficiently than conventional method at 80-90 °C for 5-24 h. The characteristics of the building blocks analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with Tris-Tricine buffer system and liquid chromatography linked to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proved that the formation of WPNFs is based on the hydrolysis of WPI, and hydrothermal can make WPI hydrolysis faster and more efficiently. The high internal phase Pickering emulsion (HIPPEs) stabilized by 5 wt% of WPNFs (internal phase fraction Phi up to 0.90) showed an excellent stability. The microstructure of HIPPEs illustrated by super resolution microscope and cryo-scanning electron microscopy showed that WPNFs tightly wrapped the oil droplets forming an ordered viscoelastic and dense interface layer. It can be speculated that WPNFs were flexible due to their large aspect ratio and mechanical strength, which allowed them to bend on the surface of the droplet to form a better package protection. Rheology and texture analysis showed that WPNFs stabilized HIPPEs have solid-like and tunable rheological properties. WPNFs were verified to improve the oil binding capacity and antioxidant activity. The results provided that hydrothermal is a novel and efficient method for preparing WPNFs, and the prepared WPNFs can be used to stabilize HIPPEs with tunable rheology.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Edible marine algae, often referred to as seaweeds, have health benefits and nutritional value. Origin discrimination of seaweeds is essential for quality assurance and traceability. As a rapid, easy, and economical method, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) was used in this study to investigate its ability to identify Sargassum fusiforme according to geographical origin, cultivar, and production method. A potential particle swarm optimization-support vector machine (PSO-SVM) identification model was constructed and exhibited its superiority in the origin determination of S. fusiforme. Results showed that the correct recognition rates were 90.00% for geographical origin, 100.00% for cultivar, and 100.00% for production method, when the PSO-SVM models were validated using the test sets. Overall, the results proved the potential of NIR spectroscopy combined with PSO-SVM models as a fast analytical method to trace the origin of S. fusiforme in terms of geographical origin, cultivar, and production method.

Food & Function					PM2.5 induces oxidative/antioxidant system imbalance and excessive release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and produces toxic effects and irreversible damage to the genetic material including chromosomes and DNA. Biochanin A (BCA), an isoflavone with strong antioxidant activity, effectively intervenes against PM2.5-induced oxidative damage. The X-ray repair cross-complementary protein 1 (XRCC1)/BER pathway involves DNA damage repair caused by oxidative stress. This paper aims to explore the mechanism of BCA alleviating oxidative DNA damage caused by PM2.5 by establishing the in vitro cell model based on CRISPR/Cas9 technology and combining it with mechanism pathway research. The results showed that PM2.5 exposure inhibited the expression of BER and NER pathway proteins and induced the overexpression of ERCC1. BCA showed an effective intervention in the toxicity of PM2.5 in normal cells, rather than XRCC1 knock-out cells. This laid a foundation for further exploring the key role of XRCC1 in PM2.5-caused oxidative damage and the BER/DNA damage repair pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	9	5102	5114	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04312a					FSTA:2022-08-Aj15245

Journal of Functional Foods					Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that seriously affects an individual's quality of life. Oleanolic acid (OLA) is widely present in food and medicinal plants and has various pharmacological activities. Autophagy is an intracellular protective mechanism, and this study aimed to investigate the potential role of OLA targeting the autophagy pathway in the pathogenesis of OA. A rat OA model was established in vivo by intra-articular injection of Monosodium Iodoacetate (MIA), followed by ELISA, Western blot analysis, and behavioral assays. The results showed that OLA improved OA pain symptoms and inhibit cartilage degeneration. In vitro, OLA inhibited the secretion of inflammatory factors and matrix metalloproteinases in ATDC5 cells after induction with IL-1beta (10 ng/mL). Meanwhile, Dansylcadaverine (MDC) staining, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), mRFP-GFP-LC3 immunofluorescence, Western blot analysis and RT-qPCR confirmed that OLA activates autophagy by inhibiting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. In conclusion, OLA shows promise in the treatment of OA. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	94				1756-4646				10.1016/j.jff.2022.105144					FSTA:2022-10-Aj18611

Food Chemistry					It plays an important role to effective detection of amphenicols antibiotic residues in food and an important issue considering of possible impact on human health. In this work, the molecularly imprinted membranes (MIMs) were proposed to simultaneously recognize and detect thiamphenicol (TAP), florfenicol (FF) and chloramphenicol (CAP) in pork and milk samples. The synergistic effect of graphene oxide (GO), double functional monomer (methacrylate and acrylamide) and "click chemistry" strategy prompted the membranes to possess good surface hydrophilicity (48.6°), excellent selectivity and capacity to exclude macromolecules. The theoretical models of selectivity mechanism showed the selective recognition depended mainly on the hydrogen bond interaction and van der Waals interaction between the analytes and monomers. The limit of detection for 3 analytes were 0.04-0.28 g kg-1, and showed a good correlation (r> 0.9949). Finally, this study established an effective MIMs-UHPLC-MS/MS method with great potential for the monitor of antibiotics residue in complicated matrices.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The chemical composition and antibacterial activities of five tea tree essential oils are analyzed. GC-MS analysis reveals that 1,8-cineole, terpinen-4-ol, p-cymene, alpha-terpineol, and alpha-pinene are the representative composition. By comparison of the diameter of inhibition zone, oil of Melaleuca leucadendron Linn. (TTO1) shows the best antimicroorganism effects on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Subsequently, the coacervation between gelatin (GE) and gum Arabic (GA) for microencapsulation as functions of pH, GE-GA ratio, emulsifiers, homogenization speed and time, and microfluidization are investigated. The optimum parameters for the coacervation effectiveness of TTO1 and emulsifier S20 are emulsification at 10,000rpm for 1min, the ratio of GE-GA as 1:2 with a concentration of 1%, and pH of 4.0. The microcapsules have a particle size of 52.601mum, spherical multinuclear morphology, and strong physical stability which show potential for their application in the controlled release of reactive materials and anticorrosion of cosmetics and foods. Novelty impact statement. The tea tree essential oils showed different antimicrobial potential toward the bacterial species tested. After microfluidization, tea tree essential oil microcapsules prepared by a complex coacervation method generated smaller particles with greater encapsulation efficiency. The microcapsules synthesized in this study can be utilized as a novel preservative in the food industry or used for the encapsulation of other bioactive compounds. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16585					FSTA:2022-11-Te4575

Food Bioscience					This study investigated the effects of the luxS gene on the biofilm formation of Lactobacillus fermentum and its stress resistance. Deletion of the luxS gene was related to the physiological characteristics of biofilm development, strain resistance, bacterial morphology, biofilm morphology, functional group types, the main components of the biofilm, and the expression of related genes. Therefore, a luxS gene-deficient strain was constructed using lambdaRed gene recombination technology, and the biofilm production and stress resistance of the WT and DeltaluxS strains were compared. Deletion of the gene reduced the biofilm formation of L. fermentum and its resistance to acid, bile salt, high temperatures, and a hypertonic environment. Further, this work found that its deletion affects the types of functional groups in biofilms, and at the same time downregulate the expressions of the fabI, cysE, argR, and purD genes, thus reducing the levels of fatty acids, exopolysaccharide, protein, and eDNA in biofilms. A correlation analysis found that protein in biofilms was the most important factor affecting biofilm formation. In conclusion, the luxS gene in L. fermentum is involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and stress resistance. These findings provide a theoretical basis for the study of the mechanism of biofilm formation in beneficial bacteria.

Food Chemistry					Here, we used techniques of extrusion and coating to produce starch-based foams with a combined function of buffering and controlled release of oxygen. The foams presented open-cell structures and showed a compression recovery ratio of 94%. After coating with poly (vinyl alcohol) solution, in which calcium peroxides were loaded, the developed functional foams showed a behavior of controllable oxygen release under a wet condition, as well as a high compression strength ( ≥ 2.2 MPa). Also, these foams showed an improved moisture resistance with a reduction in maximum moisture absorption from 25 to 14%. Under a vibrated storage condition to simulate food transportation, guavas packaged with functional foams showed a reduced physical damage, and browning index from 5.00 to 2.97, owing to the foams' superior buffering ability and self-regulation of storage atmosphere. The functional packaging system of the starch-based foams developed in our work is promising for fruit and vegetable preservations.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the signal molecule AI-2 on biofilm formation in Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. We found that the influence of signal molecule AI-2 on strains is related to a variety of physiological metabolic behaviors, such as bacterial growth, morphological characteristics, biofilm development, related gene expression, and bile salt stress tolerance. The survival rates of planktonic and biofilm forms of L. sanfranciscensis were measured after acid, bile salt, and in vitro digestion. The results showed that the biofilm strain had stronger stress resistance. Next, the effects of endogenous and synthetic AI-2 on L. sanfranciscensis growth were compared. The addition of synthetic AI-2 improved L. sanfranciscensis cell density and enhanced bacterial cohesion. Upregulated expression of ftsH was found to promote biofilm formation and growth. AI-2 intervention will improve bile salt tolerance in L. sanfranciscensis. In conclusion, the signal molecule AI-2 is involved in the regulation of biofilm formation and development in L. sanfranciscensis.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases related to cognitive decline and memory loss is on the rise as the global elderly population increases. In this study, we evaluated the effect of the sea cucumber-derived peptide Phe-Tyr-Asp-Trp-Pro-Lys (FYDWPK) on scopolamine-induced neurotoxicity in an animal model. The Morris water maze, passive avoidance apparatus, and shuttle box test were used to assess learning and memory abilities. In behavioral tests, FYDWPK effectively alleviated learning and memory impairment. FYDWPK also alleviated cholinergic dysfunction in mice with dementia. Furthermore, FYDWPK significantly improved oxidative imbalance by increasing superoxide dismutase activity and decreasing malondialdehyde levels (P< 0.05). The pathological results showed that FYDWPK alleviated neuronal loss, blurred caryotheca, and pyknotic nuclei in the hippocampus, and a high dose of FYDWPK had the best effect. In conclusion, FYDWPK alleviated cognitive and memory impairments by regulating oxidative imbalance, reducing cholinergic dysfunction, and relieving pathological alterations.										2022	70	2	567	576	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07232					FSTA:2022-05-Rg1962

Zhang; Lujia Zhang							High-level expression and improved pepsin activity by enhancing the conserved domain stability based on a scissor-like model.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Pepsin, a typical aspartic protease, is extensively used to hydrolyze large proteins in the food industry. However, the lack of an industrial expression system and mutants with high activity hinders its industrial application. Here, we aimed to promote the industrial production of pepsin and improve pepsin activity to overcome these problems. The highest reported shake-flask yield of pepsin in Pichia pastoris was achieved by establishing a solid plate screening protocol. Based on the low sequence identity but the high structural similarity of aspartic proteases, a novel scissor-like model was proposed. This model revealed that pepsin activity was improved upon enhancing the stability of the conserved, connecting domain. Following this, a rational design strategy was employed, and potentially favorable mutants were screened. As a result, the activity of the L167F mutant significantly increased by 1172 U.mg-1, and structural analyses revealed enhanced internal stability of the conserved domain in the mutant. These results indicate that the stability of the connecting domain is an influential factor in aspartate protease activity. Furthermore, our findings exemplify the rational design of distal residues in the enzyme structure.

J		Yue Zhou; Hui Xu; Ka-Wing Cheng; Feng Chen; Qian Zhou; Mingfu Wang							Acrolein evokes inflammation and autophagy-dependent apoptosis through oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells and its protection by 6-C-(E-2-fluorostyryl)naringenin.		Journal of Functional Foods					Acrolein is a common dietary and environmental toxicant. Evidence suggests that acrolein can increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases in which endothelial cells are the sensitive targets. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), acrolein treatment induced mitochondrial dysfunction, which subsequently triggered apoptosis and inflammation. Acrolein also upregulated autophagy, which possibly resulted from negative regulation of the protein kinase B (Akt)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway via reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of autophagy by 3-methyladenine reduced acrolein-evoked apoptosis, implying a pro-death role of autophagy. In addition, the protective potential of 6-C-(E-2-fluorostyryl) naringenin (6-CEFN) against acrolein was examined. 6-CEFN exhibited higher efficacy than its parental compound naringenin in preventing acrolein-caused damages, where nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2)-mediated up-regulation of phase II enzymes was involved. Altogether, our findings offer new mechanistic insights into acrolein-induced endothelial injury and demonstrate the therapeutic potential of 6-CEFN for acrolein-related cardiovascular toxicities.

Food Research International					Our previous study showed that n-3 PUFAs inhibited inflammation in rats with esophagitis. This study aimed to observe the protective effect of n-3 PUFAs against acid damage to esophageal epithelial cells (Het-1A cells) and to explore its mechanism. The level of malondialdehyde (MDA) was increased by acid exposure, while that of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was decreased. In groups with different ratios of n-6/n-3 PUFAs, the expression levels of nuclear factor E2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) and SOD were increased with increasing proportions of n-3 PUFAs and were highest in the 1:1 group. Compared with those in the 9:1 group, the expression of NOD like receptor pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) and caspase-1 and the pyroptosis rate in the 1:1 group were decreased. Intervention with an Nrf2 agonist increased the expression of Nrf2 and decreased the expression of NLRP3 and caspase-1 and the pyroptosis rate. However, inhibiting Nrf2 expression led to the opposite result. In conclusion, n-3 PUFAs protected esophageal epithelial cells from acid damage by upregulating Nrf2 expression, which disrupted oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inhibited pyroptosis.

International Journal of Food Properties					Ottelia acuminata (O. acuminata) is an edible and medicinal submerged plant endemic to southwestern China, yet there is little information available concerning its nutritional or bio-active composition. This study aimed to evaluate in detail the nutritional profile and phenolic composition of O. acuminata (inflorescence, peduncle, and leaf) and investigate a protective activity in phenolic extracts on DNA damage induced by .OH and ROO. radicals. O. acuminata was excellent sources of protein (17.7-24g/100g DW), TPC (11.43-19.00mg GAE/g DW), ascorbic acid, and minerals (especially potassium, calcium, and iron). Interestingly, the protein contained a high amount of EAA with a ratio (EAA11/TAA) in the range of 47.79-50.93%, BCAA and MSG-like AA. The inflorescences and leaves of O. acuminata contained abundant UFA with a ratio of UFA/TFA more than 50%. Five phenolic compounds, with a predominance of luteolin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside and chlorogenic acid, were identified by HPLC. Phenolic extracts of O. acuminata displayed a significant protective effect on DNA damage, which effect was comparable to that of the positive control (trolox). It was concluded that O. acuminata is an excellent vegetable with a high nutritional value and a great potential as a natural antioxidant. © 2022 Yue-Hong Lu, Xi Yang, Hai-Yan Ding, Cheng-Rui Tian and Chun-Yan Gao.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The cauliflower mosaicvirus 35S (CaMV35S), as the most common promoter, has a usage rate of 70% in transgenic crops, especially in dicots. Herein, a visual detection method of rolling circle amplification (RCA) combined with DNAzyme technology was developed for the determination of CaMV35S gene. A template sequence of the G-quadruple gene was designed for combining with the target gene CaMV35S. When the target gene existed, the RCA reaction occurred through the action of the enzyme, and the product combined with hemin to generate DNAzyme, which catalyzed the color reaction of 2′-hydrazine-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazolin-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS). Under the optimal experimental conditions, the linear range is 1*10-13~1*10-8 mol/L, and the detection limit is 3*10-14 mol/L (S/N=3). The method has been successfully applied to standard samples and practical samples (soybean and tofu). For verifying the feasibility and reliability, real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR method was used to detect the target gene CaMV35S, and the results were in good agreement with those of our method, indicating that our developed method can be used for the determination of actual samples.

J		Yue-Rong Ru; Zhen-Xing Wang; Ya-Jing Li; Huan Kan; Kin-Weng Kong; Xue-Chun Zhang							The influence of probiotic fermentation on the active compounds and bioactivities of walnut flowers.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this study, the walnut flowers were fermented using five different probiotics, including two Lactobacillus plantarum, one Lactobacillus bulgaricus, one Lactobacillus casei, and one Lactobacillus rhamnosus. The chemical compositions, antioxidant capacities, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory abilities of walnut flowers during fermentation processes were evaluated. The results showed that all the active compounds and bioactivities of the walnut flowers were significantly decreased after 7 days of fermentation, whereas a short-term fermentation (1-3 days) enhanced their bioactivities. Compared to the unfermented sample, L. plantarum (ATCC 8014) and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53013) increased the ABTS (1.22 and 1.30 times higher) and DPPH radical scavenging activities (up to 1.23 and 1.04 times), respectively. L. plantarum (SWFU D16), L. plantarum (ATCC 8014), and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 53013) improved the ferric reducing antioxidant power which was 110.98%, 133.16%, and 104.76% of the unfermented sample. All five probiotics promoted the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory ability of walnut flowers (maximum 2.18-fold increase). Three phenolic acids and five flavonoids in the fermentation broth were identified by HPLC, where catechin, epicatechin, and catechin gallate were the dominant components. HPLC results demonstrated that these compounds were degraded and transformed in varying degrees under the effects of probiotics. Taken together, a short-term probiotic fermentation could change the active compounds of the walnut flowers and improve their bioactivities. L. plantarum (ATCC 8014) and L. rhamnosus (ATCC 334) are suggested as suitable strains in producing the fermented walnut flowers. The research findings could further support the development and utilization of walnut flowers as a fermented functional food. Practical applications. Walnut flowers have been used as fermented food in southwestern China, but their active components and functional activities during fermentation processes are still unclear. This study found that different probiotic fermentation exerted a strong and varied influence on the chemical composition and biological activities of the walnut flowers. A short-term fermentation has significantly improved their antioxidant capacities and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory abilities, whereas the longer period of fermentation, caused a significant loss of both their active compounds and bioactivities. These findings are useful as a reference for the manufacturers of fermented walnut flowers in selecting suitable strains and fermentation time for their products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13887					FSTA:2022-08-Js10938

Journal of Dairy Science					epsilon-Polylysine (epsilon-PL) is a natural preservative of antimicrobial peptides with broad spectrum and high antibacterial properties. The electrostatic complex delivery system formed by epsilon-PL and whey protein can be used to maintain the stability of epsilon-PL and solve the problem of limited application of protein-based food. This work aimed to study the interaction between epsilon-PL and whey protein by multiple characterization methods. The spectroscopy results showed static quenching type and new stretching of C=O for epsilon-PL-whey protein complexes. Microstructure studies showed that the combination of epsilon-PL and whey protein made the structure of the complexes become rough and dense. The interaction between epsilon-PL and whey protein could improve the stability of the complexes system during storage. Additionally, the interaction affected critical gel temperatures and gel texture properties of complexes with change of whey protein concentration, mass ratio of epsilon-PL to whey protein, pH value in alkaline solutions, and ion concentration.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is considered to have a key role in the food industry because it initiates enzymatic browning in the processing and storage of fruit and vegetables. Increasing numbers of benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives have been found to be efficient inhibitors of polyphenol oxidase, but a comparison study on activity and action mechanism is lacking. In this study, 18 benzoic acid and cinnamic acid hydroxy derivatives were selected and investigated. Results. Three substrates, four activators and 11 inhibitors were identified from benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives. 2, 4-Dihydroxycinnamic acid and benzoic acid showed the strongest inhibitory effect on PPO, with IC50 of 0.092 and1.425 mmol L-1, respectively. Benzoic acid reversibly inhibited PPO in a competitive manner, while 2, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid showed a mixed-type inhibition. Both of them showed that static-type fluorescence quenching and electrostatic interaction were the main driving force in the bonding process. Compared with benzoic acid, 2, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid more easily formed hydrogen bonds in the active site of PPO, making the interaction more stable. Conclusion. Comparative analysis showed that the inhibition effect of cinnamic acid hydroxyl derivatives on PPO was stronger than that of benzoic acid derivatives. Benzoic acid and 2, 4-dihydroxycinnamic acid were the strongest inhibitors. PPO inhibitors identified from benzoic and cinnamic acid derivatives are expected to be promising inhibitors for controlling fruit and vegetable browning. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	9	3771	3780	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11725					FSTA:2022-10-Ja13759

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma, lower and higher dose electron beam irradiation (EBI) are used widely in food processing. In this research, impacts of DBD plasma and EBI processing on characteristics of Tartary buckwheat whole flour were investigated in the range of parameters used most often in food industry. Cross section, small granule and reaggregation of fragments appeared after processing as well as higher values of L*, a* and WI. DBD plasma processing altered the short range crystal structure and hydrogen-containing groups, increasing oil/water absorption and freeze-thaw stability. DBD plasma and EBI processing had a mostly positive effect on hydration properties at 50 to 70°C, with contrast to a reduction effect at higher temperature. DBD plasma and EBI processing will not affect the nutrients content indeed. TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity increased significantly after EBI processing ( ≤ 10 kGy) with few free radicals generated. Industrial relevance DBD plasma and EBI processing are widely used for flour in food industry, with limited focus on physicochemical properties promotion and antioxidant activity protection. This research indicates that DBD plasma processing can affect the properties of Tartary buckwheat whole flour (TBF) significantly, but it shows negative damage to bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity. EBI processing ( ≤ 10 kGy) can improve physicochemical properties of TBF, which is given slightly higher TPC, TFC and antioxidant activity simultaneously. Both of DBD plasma and EBI processing are safe methods that can improve processing characteristics of the flour, while lower dose EBI processing is more suitable for development of Tartary buckwheat and functional food industry with protection to bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Shrimp is a type of aquatic product that is easy to deteriorate and the freshness has an essential influence on both its taste and nutritional value. Scientists have developed various approaches to measure shrimp freshness; however, the existing methods are usually destructive, complicated and costly. To develop a fast, non-destructive and low-cost alternative, we utilized deep learning models to identify the freshness of shrimp based on photos taken by smartphones. The models were trained on photographs of 306 shrimp along with their total volatile basic nitrogen values as freshness indicators. Our models achieved an area under receiver operating characteristic above 0.90 for freshness classification and root mean square error of prediction no more than 4.67 mg/100 g on fresh samples during the independent tests. Furthermore, the model performance was evaluated on datasets of shrimp photographed for 7 consecutive days and shrimp placed on different backgrounds and light settings. Our study suggested deep learning as an accurate, easy and low-cost method to detect shrimp freshness, which may have broader applications in food safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	5	3868	3876	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01473-4					FSTA:2023-02-Re0842

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The pectin extracted from Ottelia acuminata inflorescence was investigated for its physicochemical and emulsifying properties. Ottelia acuminata inflorescence pectin (OAIP), with a yield of 8.73g/100g, contained 2.39g/100g of moisture, 0.84 g/100 g of total ash and 1.83 g/100 g of protein. The results revealed that OAIP was low methylated carrying negative charges. The charge density and molecular morphology of the pectin changed significantly with pH variation. A formula for the relation of dynamic viscosity with temperature and concentration was established: eta = 0.01683 exp (16.3283 exp (0.0262 C) / RT) (C)-1.5816. At OAIP concentration of 2.0 g/100 mL, a stable emulsion containing fifty percent oil fraction (v/v) can be achieved. At 1.0 g/100 mL OAIP concentration, the emulsion containing fifty percent oil fraction was stable within 7 days, after which remarkable emulsion layer separation was observed for all emulsions at different pH values, Na+ and Ca2+ concentrations.

J		Yuehua Jiao; Han Yang; Nditange Shigwedha; Shuang Zhang; Fei Liu; Lanwei Zhang							Probiotic effects and metabolic products of Enterococcus faecalis LD33 with respiration capacity.		Foods					Respiration metabolism could improve the long-term survival of lactic acid bacteria (LAB); however, its effect on potential probiotic traits of LAB was not reported. The difference made by Enterococcus faecalis LD33 that was cultured under respiration-permissive and fermentation conditions, such as the biomass, metabolites, antimicrobial activity, tolerance to acid and bile salt, adhesion capabilities, and the ability to inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells were studied. Under a respiration-permissive condition, the final biomass of the culture was about twice as compared to that of fermentation condition. When the metabolites were measured, glucose was exhausted within 8 h. Two-folds of acetic acid, triple of both acetoin and diacetyl, and less than half of lactic acid, were accumulated under the respiratory-permissive condition. No discrimination of growth inhibition on Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028 and Shigella sonnei ATCC 25931 was observed when Enterococcus faecalis LD33 was cultured under both conditions; however, under respiration-permissive condition, the strain presented significant antimicrobial activities to Listeria monocytogenes ATCC19111 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC6538P. Enterococcus faecalis LD33 displayed relatively strong bile salt tolerance and adherence capability but weaker acid tolerance when undergoing respiration metabolism. There was no significant difference in the anti-cancer effect of the viable bacterial cells on both growth modes; however, the supernatant showed a higher inhibition effect on HT-29 cells than the live bacteria, and there was no significant difference between the supernatant and the 5-Fluorouracil (7 mug/mL). Consequently, the Enterococcus faecalis LD33 undergoing respiration metabolism could bring higher biomass, more flavor metabolites, and better antimicrobial and anti-cancer activities. This study extends our knowledge of respiratory metabolism in LAB and its impact on probiotic traits. E. faecalis LD33 qualifies as a suitable strain against foodborne pathogens, cancer therapy, and eventual application in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To improve the gel properties of low-sodium tilapia surimi, the effects of microwave-ultrasonic, single microwave, single ultrasonic and traditional water-bath heating treatments on the characteristics of low-sodium tilapia surimi gel in the gel setting stage were investigated in this study. Compared with other treatment groups, the water-bath heating and microwave-ultrasonic-assisted heating (WB-MW/US) + 1.5% NaCl group had higher gel strength (403.30g cm) and water-holding capacity (87.88%). LF-NMR and CD spectrum analysis indicated that microwave and ultrasonic combination increased the degree of protein cross-linking and moisture proton density. In addition, microwave and ultrasonic combination had minimal effect on the secondary protein structure. WB-MW/US + 1.5% NaCl group had more beta-sheet (27.80%) and random coil content (22.30%), resulting in a uniform and dense spatial network structure of the low-sodium tilapia surimi gel. The results indicated that the microwave-ultrasonic combination treatment could be used as an efficient strategy for the production of new energy, low-sodium surimi gel products.

J		Yuehui Wang; Zhijiang Zhou; Ye Han							Development and physicochemical characterization of a novel intelligent composite films incorporating curcumin into levan-chitosan.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Chitosan, levan and curcumin (Cur) were used to produce active functional films by solution casting method. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray test results showed that the Cur was uniformly dispersed in chitosan and levan matrix. The addition of Cur decreased the moisture content and swelling water slightly without changing the thermal stability of the composite film. The UV-barrier increased by 73.4%. And the highest scavenging activity of ABTS and DPPH was 91.011.08% and 78.841.22% in the composite film containing 0.4% Cur. The release profiles of Cur into 90% and 50% ethanol solution showed that the Cur release was diffusion driven and reached up to nearly 90% in 50% ethanol. Experiments on the capacity of detect NH3 vapor and pH-sensitivity showed that the b* and L* values decreased to negative value. Therefore, the prepared LE/CS/Cur composite film had the potential to be used as an easy-to-use, nondestructive smart packaging material for food products and as a means of monitoring NH3 gas in environmental applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Myofibrillar binding serine protease (MBSP) existing in fish muscle is the leading cause of gel deterioration, which adversely affects the quality of surimi produces. Screening and preparation of protease inhibitors with high efficiency and specificity is an important approach to address the reduction of surimi quality. In this study, shark derived single domain antibody specific to MBSP was expressed and its properties were investigated systematically. The results showed that single domain antibody specific to MBSP could be expressed in soluble using SUMO fusion tagged Escherichia coli expression system with good thermal and pH stability. The enzyme activity inhibition effect in vitro could reach 62.9% at the concentration of 0.1mg/ml of single domain antibody. When added in silver carp surimi, it could significantly inhibit the deterioration of surimi gel. The results of this study implied that shark derived single domain antibody could be developed as a new inhibitor of MBSP used for the control of gel degradation in surimi produces. Novelty impact statement. Shark derived single domain antibody specific to MBSP was expressed in soluble with high yield and stability; the expressed antibody could significantly inhibit the activity of MBSP both in vitro and in surimi; this good characteristic makes it to be an inhibitor for the deterioration of surimi gel. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16912					FSTA:2023-03-Rc1245

Food Chemistry					To investigate whether apigenin, a common flavone in celery, can be esterified with carboxylic acids generated during frying leading to the consequently change of its antioxidant activity, we prepared a group of apigenin esters using fatty acids of varying chain lengths (C3:0-C18:0) and further checked their presence in celeries fried in soybean oil, rapeseed oil, and palm oil. Apigenin-7,4′-O-dioctanoate was detected in celeries fried in soybean and rapeseed oil. Apigenin-7,4′-O-dilaurinate was detected in celeries fried in all the three oils. In addition, all the apigenin esters exhibited lower ABTS and DPPH radical scavenging activity but improved lipophilicity and stronger cellular antioxidant activity than the parent compound, apigenin. These results demonstrated for the first time that apigenin could be esterified by carboxylic acids generated from lipid peroxidation under thermal processing, and these esters showed enhanced lipophilicity and cellular antioxidant activity.

Food Chemistry					Carbon nitride quantum dots (CNQDs) were embedded in the sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) matrix to form CNQDs-CMC film to explore the room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of CNQDs, which suppress the non-radiative relaxation process due to the internal hydrogen bonding interactions between CMC and CNQDs. Then, a simple, inexpensive, background-free miniature device integrating with CNQDs-CMC film and smartphone was fabricated for rapid and quantitative detection of melamine (MEL). In the present of MEL, the yellow RTP color of the CNQDs-CMC film was quenched and photographed by the smartphone. The Color Recognizer APP in the smartphone recognized the red (R) value for quantitative detection of MEL. Thus, digital image colorimetry (DIC) determination of MEL was achieved due to the visible RTP color change of CNQDs-CMC film. The smartphone-based miniature device provided a promising platform for the on-site monitoring analytes in the complex matrix including food safety, environmental screening, health monitoring, and disease prevention.

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to investigate the formation of odor properties in surimi products by exploring changes in aroma compounds and their precursors at setting (40 °C) and gelling (90 °C) stages during surimi gel formation by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and ultra performance liquid chromatography. Results Revealed a gradual increase in the contents of most aldehydes, alcohols, and phenolics during surimi gel formation, while a decrease in the contents of (E)-2-pentenal, (E)-2-hexnenal, (Z)-4-heptenal, (E)-2-heptenal, and most ketones at gelling stage. During thermal process, 50% decrease was observed in the contents of some unsaturated fatty acids (palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, etc.), and the contents of tyrosine, phenylalanine, methionine, isoleucine, and leucine decreased significantly (P< 0.05) at gelling stage. Moreover, lipoxygenase activity reached 4.19-4.81 U/min. G at setting stage. Overall, amino acid degradation and lipid auto-oxidation mainly occurred at gelling stage to promote the formation of related compounds.

J		Yueqi An; Shanbai Xiong; Yanping Qian; Qian, M. C.							In vivo and in vitro aroma release in surimi gel with different cross-linking degrees by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry.		Food Chemistry					Transglutaminase-induced cross-linking has been suggested as a strategy to govern surimi gels' texture. To achieve the aroma regulation of surimi gels by cross-links, surimi gels were treated with microbial transglutaminase to get different cross-linking degrees, and in vivo and in vitro aroma releases were investigated by a proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Seventeen compounds in surimi gels were detected by PTR-MS. The in vitro release curves of odorants were fitted by a pseudo-first-order kinetics model. As the cross-links increased, most aroma compounds' released concentrations and release rates decreased first, and then increased significantly (P< 0.05) when the cross-linking degree exceed around 35.4%, negatively related to the springiness and the gel strength of surimi gels. However, the in vivo aroma release results showed that the harder surimi gel released fewer aroma compounds. In conclusion, texture affected by cross-links could be a strategy to control the aroma release of surimi gels.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The warmed-over flavor (WOF) in surimi gels was characterized by gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry, aroma extract dilution analysis, aroma recombination, and omission studies. Surimi gels with different WOF levels were prepared by different gelling temperatures, and surimi gels heated at 90, 100, and 121°C were considered as the samples with light, strong, and medium WOF, respectively. Based on the quantification and odor activity values, 14 aldehydes, 2 ketones, 3 alcohols, 2 benzene-containing compounds, 2 N-containing compounds, 3 S-containing compounds, 3 lactones, undecanoic acid, and 4-methylphenol were recombined to build a spiked model for surimi gels with the strongest WOF, which showed the highest similarity with the original sample. Finally, a triangle test involving omission of the aroma compounds from the spiked model proved that the WOF in surimi gels was attributed to (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, (E)-2-nonenal, (E)-2-octenal, (E)-2-decenal, (E,E)-2,4-heptadienal, 2,3-pentanedione, 2,6-dimethylpyrazine, 2-propylpyridine, benzothiazole, 2-methoxybenzenethiol, and 2-furfurylthiol.										2022	70	30	9451	9462	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02119					FSTA:2022-12-Rc4919

Foods					Spontaneous fermentation is a critical processing step that determines the taste quality of fermented mandarin fish (Siniperca chuatsi). Here, untargeted metabolomics using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with Q Exactive tandem mass spectrometry was employed to characterize the taste-related metabolite profiles during the fermentation of mandarin fish. The results demonstrated that the taste profiles of mandarin fish at different stages of fermentation could be distinguished using an electronic tongue technique. Sixty-two metabolites, including amino acids, small peptides, fatty acids, alkaloids, and organic acids, were identified in fermented mandarin fish samples. Additional quantitative analysis of amino acids revealed glutamic acid and aspartic acid as significant contributors to the fresh flavor. Furthermore, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis revealed that amino acid metabolism was the dominant pathway throughout the fermentation process. This study provides a scientific and theoretical reference for the targeted regulation of the quality of fermented mandarin fish. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Yueqiao Wang; Junjie Wang; Yong Kuang; Wenbiao Shen							Packaging with hydrogen gas modified atmosphere can extend chicken egg storage.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Although hydrogen gas (H2) has been widely used in industry and gradually used in medicine, it is less applied to agriculture, especially in modified atmosphere packing (MAP). Results. During chicken egg storage, H2 MAP not only slowed down or delayed the reduction in antioxidant capacities, but also alleviated the deterioration of egg quality. The extent of micro-cracks in the eggshell was also negatively influenced by H2, which might result in eggs being less vulnerable to microbes. The earlier results demonstrated that the H2 MAP-extended shelf life of chicken eggs might be caused by the responses of eggshell and re-establishment of redox homeostasis. According to the data collected from different provinces of China, cost-economics analysis further suggested that the increase in the extra cost caused by H2 was trivial compared with the original price of eggs. Conclusion. Together, H2 MAP can prolong the shelf life of chicken eggs with the prospect of wider application. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	3	976	983	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11431					FSTA:2022-04-Qa0265

Food & Function					The hypoglycemic and metabolic effects of Ficus racemosa fruit were studied in diabetic mice, and its potential mechanisms of hypoglycemic activity and its alleviation of diabetic complications were explored using a metabolomics approach. The histopathological effect of Ficus racemosa fruit was characterized by hematoxylin and eosin histological staining. Dynamic fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial glucose (PPG), body weight, and biochemical parameters, including hepatic-renal function and lipid levels, were monitored to confirm the hypoglycemic activity and attenuation effect. The metabolomics analysis was performed using the established platform, combining liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with statistical analysis to identify the metabolites internally regulated by Ficus racemosa fruit. Desorption electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) was employed to explore the presence and spatial distribution patterns of differential molecules further. An inhibition of blood glucose levels and improvements in tissue lesions were observed after Ficus racemosa fruit treatment, especially with high-dose treatment. Ficus racemosa fruit primarily induced metabolomic alterations in amino acids, organic acids and nucleotides, and displayed a systematic effect, which involved the mediation of amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, energy metabolism and lipid accumulation. The effect of Ficus racemosa fruit on the liver was primarily discussed in this study, and it regulated purine metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, arginine biosynthesis, histidine metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and the citrate cycle. Through the mediation of related pathways or single molecules that could affect insulin resistance, insulin secretion or FBG, e.g., the amino acid histidine or the organic acid uric acid in the liver, Ficus racemosa fruit achieved its hypoglycemic effect and alleviated diabetic complications in the liver. The results of the tissue metabolomic analysis, histopathological analysis, plasma biochemical parameters, plasma metabolite analysis and tissue DESI-MSI analysis were consistent with one another. The present study provides the evidence of the hypoglycemic effect and its alleviation of diabetic complications for Ficus racemosa fruit as well as the scientific support for its traditional use. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	14	7871	7884	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01163h					FSTA:2022-11-Jg15376

European Food Research and Technology					As a major class of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins are the functional components of blueberry. Vaccinium corymbosum "Lanmei 1" is a novel blueberry variety and detailed study of their anthocyanins remains scarce. Therefore, a simultaneously quantitative method for five anthocyanins using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) was established here. Good linear relationships were obtained ranging from 1 to 100 ng/mL (R2>0.99). In addition, the specificity, recovery, stability, and matrix effect met requirements of analytical methodology. The method successfully monitored the concentrations of five anthocyanins in plasma and studied their pharmacokinetics after oral administration of 270mg of anthocyanin extract in Sprague-Dawley rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters for delphinidin-3-O-glucoside (D3G), malvidin-3-O-glucoside (M3G), malvidin-3-O-arabinoside (M3A), delphinidin-3-O-arabinoside (D3A), and petunidin-3-O-arabinoside (P3A) showed the similar short Tmax 0.25-0.28 h and medium speed T1/2 3.24-3.52 h. It indicated anthocyanins were quickly absorbed and taken effectively, but eliminated in blood at an appropriate rate. Contents of D3G and M3G in anthocyanin extract are approximately equivalent, while the total amount and maximum concentration of M3G were twice those of D3G in plasma. This demonstrated that there were many differences between the substance contents of anthocyanin monomers in vitro and their absorption and distribution behaviors in vivo. Multiple peaks in both concentration-time profiles and bile excretions for five anthocyanins suggested the possibility of enterohepatic circulation in rats. The present study developed and validated a rapid and sensitive bioanalytical method based on UPLC-MS/MS for quantifying major anthocyanins from a novel blueberry extract in rat plasma to further understand their absorption, distribution, and metabolism. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	8	2109	2124	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-04034-7					FSTA:2022-11-Jf14900

Food Chemistry					Combination of dietary flavonoid-baicalein and acarbose reduces the risk that prediabetes will develop into type 2 diabetes mellitus; however, the mechanism underlying this effect has not been clarified. In this study, the in vitro culture conditions of intestinal microorganisms from prediabetic mice were optimized to increase over 30% similarity between in vitro cultured and fecal samples. Baicalein and acarbose alone and in combination, and their corresponding starch hydrolysate were assayed by the in vitro model. The results indicated that the combination of baicalein with acarbose decreased gas production by reducing the residual starch ratio in starch hydrolysate and decreasing the dosage of acarbose, and that reducing the relative abundance of gut bacteria correlated with gas production is the main mechanism. This study provided a theoretical foundation for the development of flavonoid dietary supplements to enhance the efficacy of oral hypoglycemic agents with fewer side effects and higher efficacy.

J		Yueting Ge; Yuhui Yang; Yuge Jiang; Chuanxing Feng; Bowen Li; Jin Sun; Xue Tang; Yonghui Shi; Guowei Le							Oxidized pork induces hepatic steatosis by impairing thyroid hormone function in mice.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Recent studies have linked high consumption of red and processed meats to an increased risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cooking-induced oxidation of proteins and amino acids might be contributing factors. Herein, this study investigates the influence of oxidized pork and the protein oxidation biomarker dityrosine (Dityr) on hepatic steatosis in mice. Methods and Results. Low-and high-oxidative injury pork (LOP and HOP) are freeze-dried to prepare mouse diets. Mice are fed a diet of either the control, LOP, HOP, LOP+Dityr, or Dityr for 12 weeks. HOP and Dityr intake induced oxidative stress and inflammation that impaired thyroid function and peripheral metabolism (reduced type 1 deiodinase activity) of thyroid hormones (THs). These lead to a decrease in the circulating as well as liver THs and induced hepatic steatosis. This process might be regulated through reduced TH levels and altered TH target genes and proteins related to hepatic lipid metabolism that ultimately inhibited hepatic energy metabolism, as indicated by increased hepatic lipid synthesis, decreased hepatic lipid catabolism, and fatty acid oxidation. Conclusion. HOP intake could induce hepatic steatosis by impairing TH function. Dityr plays an important role in the HOP-induced harmful effects. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	1			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100602					FSTA:2022-04-Sj2082

Food Chemistry					Untargeted metabolomics was performed to study the profiles of 101 chemicals in lotus seeds using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detection-high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Among them, 16 dimeric, 18 trimeric, and 4 tetrameric proanthocyanidins were theoretically identified based on the degree of polymerization, and the number of linkages and the presence of two dihydroflavonols and three glycosylated alkaloids were determined for the first time. The proanthocyanidin, flavonoid, amino acid, and total compound contents were quantified, revealing decreases in their levels during maturation as well as a polymerization process formation of polymers from monomers during seed maturation. Interestingly, glycosylated alkaloids were only detected in seed cotyledons being highest at green-brown stage, whereas proanthocyanidins were present at a concentration of 8,226.19249.96 mug/g (dry weight) in green-brown stage of seed coats.

J		Yuewei Zheng; Xiaomin Li; Yao Huang; Houbin Li; Lingyun Chen; Xinghai Liu							Two colorimetric films based on chitin whiskers and sodium alginate/gelatin incorporated with anthocyanins for monitoring food freshness.		Food Hydrocolloids					Intelligent food packaging materials from natural resources has attracted increasing attention nowadays. In this paper, two fresh colorimetric films were obtained by incorporating natural pigment anthocyanins extract (LRM) as pH-sensitive pigments into two polyelectrolyte complex films composed of chitin whiskers (CW) and sodium alginate (SA) /gelatin (GE), respectively. The analysis results of FTIR, SEM and DSC show that, compared with the single polysaccharide system of SA or GE, the composite film with addition of CW has better water resistance and thermal stability, due to the existence of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Meanwhile, the adhesion to LRM is also enhanced. At the same time, through Ritger-Peppas kinetic model analysis, the release process of anthocyanins in the two film systems was analyzed.

W.; Joshua Gong; Qi Wang							Spray-drying microencapsulation of citral with soy protein-soy polysaccharide Maillard reaction products: stability and release characteristics.		Food Hydrocolloids					Soy polysaccharide is a new source of hydrocolloids that demonstrated some unique functions, such as improving the emulsifying property of proteins. Citral is an essential oil that shows promise as an alternative to antibiotics for livestock such as chickens. However, lack of effective delivery methods has limited its application in livestock production. The objectives of this study were to develop and characterize, in vitro and in vivo, a citral product encapsulated with a soy protein-soy polysaccharide Maillard reaction product (SPPMP) through spray drying technology. During initial formulation screenings, SPPMP significantly outperformed the physical mixture of soy protein and soy polysaccharide (SPP). A formulation comprising 10.4% SPPMP and 13% citral was selected for further evaluation. When tested in the simulated gastrointestinal system, the SPPMP-microparticles retained over 75% of citral after the gastric phase and released the citral completely during the intestinal phase. The release of citral from the SPPMP-and SPP-microparticles in the simulated gastrointestinal system followed the zero-order kinetics at the early phase (0-180min), and a first order non-linear BoxLucasl kinetics at the later phase (>180min). The release kinetic parameters were significantly better for SPPMP-microparticles compared to SPP-microparticles (p < 0.05). When tested in vivo, a threefold increase in citral concertation was detected in the intestinal digesta obtained from chickens fed with SPPMP-microparticles compared to chickens fed with non-encapsulated citral. Good long-term stability of citral in SPPMP-microparticles was observed. The current study demonstrates that SPPMP is a suitable encapsulation wall material for intestinal delivery of citral and potentially other similar hydrophobic compounds.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Chondrus ocellatus is a kind of red algae and shows diverse pharmacological activities. This article planned to extract polyphenols and study their pharmacological activities. The extraction conditions were optimized utilizing response surface methodology. Antioxidant activities, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity were tested. The consequences revealed that optimal extraction was obtained with an ethanol concentration of 61%, an extraction time of 41 min, and an extraction temperature of 60 °C. The extracts inhibited ABTS and DPPH with 43.48%-53.50% and 13.11%-25.77%, respectively. For H2O2, the inhibition was 18.4-85.6 U/ml. The IC50 values were 16.922.31 mg/ml (anti-alpha-glycosidase) and 375.33.47 mg/ml (anti-alpha-glucosidase). The extracts showed competitive and mixed inhibition against alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, respectively. This study provided preliminary data for the anti-type 2 diabetes treatment of phenolic compounds from C. ocellatus. Practical applications.

Food Chemistry					The quality of postharvest apples is greatly affected by storage temperatures. In this paper, the sensory qualities, such as flavor, texture, color, and taste change of apples during storage at 4°C and 20°C were investigated. After correlation analysis, the partial least squares (PLS) and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques were used to build a shelf-life prediction model. The results showed that lower temperature storage can better maintain the color, flesh hardness, and release of volatile compounds of apples. The acidity of apples stored at 20°C decreased much faster than that at 4°C. The PLS models were successful in predicting the apple shelf life. When modeling using PLS with a single type index, the order of accuracy of the prediction model was texture, color, and flavor. As a nonlinear algorithm, the ANN model was also an effective predictive tool of apple shelf life at both temperatures.

Huizao) during cold storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study evaluated the effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), chitosan (CTS), and combined 1-MCP and CTS (1-MCP & CTS) on the postharvest quality, bioactive compounds, antioxidant enzymes, and antioxidant capacity in Hui jujube during cold storage (0 1°C and 90% 5% relative humidity for 75 d). The 1-MCP & CTS treatment inhibited respiration rate and ethylene production, delayed the degradation of total soluble solids and titratable acid, and alleviated the decreases in total polyphenols, total flavonoids, anthocyanins, and ascorbic acid during storage. Compared to the control fruit, 1-MCP & CTS treatment resulted in higher activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase and higher antioxidant capacity. The antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with the contents of bioactive compounds and antioxidant enzymes and negatively correlated with respiration rate and ethylene production. The results suggest that 1-MCP and CTS can be applied to maintain the antioxidant systems and delay the senescence of jujube fruit. Novelty impact statement. The effects of 1-MCP, CTS, and 1-MCP & CTS during jujube storage were evaluated. Among treatments, the combined treatment had the best preservation effect. 1-MCP & CTS maintained bioactive compounds, antioxidant capacity, and storage quality of Hui jujube. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16483					FSTA:2022-07-Jg10243

Dongzao).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Winter jujube inevitably suffers from rapid oxidation after harvest, leading to quality deterioration. Temperature plays an important role in the ripening and senescence of fruit. This study aimed to investigate the effect of different temperatures on the quality parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities, and antioxidant enzyme-related gene expressions of winter jujube. Jujube fruit were stored at room temperature (RT: 25 °C) and low temperature (LT: 0 °C) for 35 days, respectively. Compared with RT, LT maintained higher firmness and lower respiratory rate, inhibited the increase of weight loss, decay rate, total soluble solids (TSS) and reddening rate, delayed the decrease of titratable acid (TA) and ascorbic acid (AsA) content. LT-stored jujube fruit also showed higher antioxidant enzyme activities and related gene expression (Mn-SOD, APX,and GR, except CAT). We observed a significant correlation between fruit quality parameters and antioxidant enzymes, suggesting that fruit senescence is closely related to antioxidant ability. In short, LT delayed the ripening rate by inducing a series of physiological and molecular reactions, thereby improving antioxidant levels and storage quality.

J		Yueying Sang; Yuxing Liu; Yisong Tang; Wanting Yang; Minrui Guo; Guogang Chen							Transcriptome sequencing reveals mechanism of improved antioxidant capacity and maintained postharvest quality of winter jujube during cold storage after salicylic acid treatment.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Harvested winter jujube fruit undergo rapid senescence and oxidation, which seriously affects their commercialization. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous salicylic acid (SA) treatment on postharvest quality, antioxidant systems, and differential expressed genes (DEGs) of winter jujube during cold storage. We found SA treatment delayed weight loss and decay, inhibited respiratory rate and ethylene production, and maintained higher activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbic acid peroxidase, and glutathione reductase. It also increased contents of phenols, flavonoids, ascorbic acid, and reduced glutathione. Transcriptome analysis showed that the DEGs in comparison groups were mainly involved in metabolic pathways, secondary metabolic biosynthesis, and plant hormone signal transduction. SA treatment up-regulated the antioxidant-related genes (SOD1/3, GRXC2, APX1, and CTV5), and also participated in the regulation of plant hormone signaling related genes (ABF4, SnRK2, PYL2, PP2C, MKK4, ERF, EBF2 and JAZ), senescence associated genes (PME15, CTL2, INVE, ADH2, SAG21, SRK2H and ATG4), and transcription factors (MYB, ERF, C2H2, MTB3, WRKY, and FAR1). Therefore, we concluded that exogenous SA could enhance the antioxidant systems and maintain storage quality by regulating related gene expressions and metabolic pathways. These results contribute to understand the mechanism of delaying ripening and senescence of winter jujube.

International Journal of Food Properties					Niangpi (cold skin noodles) with northwestern characteristics is one of the traditional foods in China. To promote the development of traditional food, the current study was designed to improve the formulation and production process of Niangpi. A single factor, Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to investigate the appropriate amount of polysaccharides (including potato starch, konjac flour, and sodium alginate) and their influence on instrumental texture profile analysis (TPA) and sensory evaluation of Niangpi. The effect of different wobbling times (0s, 70s, 140s, 220s) on sensory evaluation, microstructure, face rate, and TPA of Niangpi was explored. The optimum level of potato starch, konjac flour, and sodium alginate determined by the single factor test and RSM was 1.0, 0.15, and 0.03% and 1.24, 0.16, and 0.03%, respectively. The quality of Niangpi was the best at 220 s wobbling time. The wobbling time increased the pore structure and hierarchy of Niangpi, and presented a strongly positive correlation with the hardness, gumminess, and a strongly negative correlation with adhesiveness, chewiness, and cohesiveness. The obtained results revealed that both the optimized formulation and production process not only simplified the preparation but also improved the quality and sensory characteristics of Niangpi. © 2022 Yueyue He, Bushra Safdar, He Li, Wenjie Song, Lu Li, Cunshe Chen, Mengdan Wu and Xinqi Liu.

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to investigate the effect of myofiber changes and protein oxidation on water holding capacity (WHC) of bighead carp fillets stored at -20 °C. WHC, microstructure, protein oxidation parameters, and specific modifications of oxidized amino acids were analyzed during 9 months of frozen storage. Results indicated that WHC decreased accompanied by myofibers' structural changes (including the formation of cavities among myofibers, breakage of myofibrils and myofibers, and shortening of sarcomeres) and protein oxidation. SDS-PAGE and carbonyl and sulfhydryl content determination of myofibrillar proteins and exudates gave a detailed description of the protein oxidation. LC-MS/MS analysis demonstrated that oxidation, di-oxidation, and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and malondialdehyde (MDA) adduction were the top four oxidative modifications of proteins. Oxidative modifications impaired configuration and polarity of proteins, which may further affect WHC. This study provides plausible explanations to support the role of protein oxidation in the decrease of WHC in frozen fillets.

Food Research International					For frozen fillets, the formation of ice crystals destroys the integrity of cell and organelle membranes and causes the release of enzymes that are capable of catalyzing oxidation of myofibrillar proteins (MPs). Exudates from fresh, freeze-thaw (F-T) treated, and frozen stored fillets that were contained those enzymes were collected to explore the protein composition and changes in abundance of the main protein oxidation-related enzymes. Results indicated that enzymes with oxidative capacity were up-regulated and some antioxidant enzymes were down-regulated in exudates collected from 5 months frozen fillets. Changes in abundance of MPs in exudates suggested that degradation of MPs in thawed fillets was a comprehensive result of the F-T treatment, enzymatic degradation, and protein oxidation. The oxidative capacity of exudates was confirmed because incubation with exudates enhanced carbonyls and Schiff bases contents in MPs. Overall, the results of our study suggested that enzymes in exudates were a potential factor in protein oxidation in thawed fillets.

Foods					Intermuscular bones (IBs) pose physical hazards that threaten consumer health and food safety. This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of softening IBs from silver carp with diluted acetic acid. IBs (separated from muscle) and fillets (without removing IBs) were treated with diluted acetic acid. Analyses of sensory attributes and the hardness of treated IBs indicated that diluted acetic acid (<10mmol/L) could soften IBs effectively. Additionally, 0.5mmol/L acetic acid softened IBs within fillets without significantly affecting the texture and flavor of fillets. Analyses of microstructure, minerals (calcium and phosphorus) and collagen content, and the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of IBs indicated that acetic acid broke connections (formed by collagen that shared hydroxyl groups) between collagen molecules, and between collagen and hydroxyapatite (HAP), thus inducing the dissolution of collagen and HAP. The dissolution of HAP contributed more to IBs softening than collagen. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The current study was conducted to investigate the effects of zinc enrichment on the characteristics, metabolites and antioxidant activity of L. plantarum DNZ-4. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the ultrastructure of the zinc-enriched strain changed greatly both for surface and inside as compared to the control strain. The zinc-enriched strain showed higher acid production ability resulting in lower pH value. Resistance assays demonstrated that the zinc-enriched strain has stronger tolerance ability to acid, bile salt and H2O2 than that of the control strain. Metabolites analysis indicated that the various metabolites in the zinc-enriched strain were altered significantly as a result of amino acids, energy and fatty acid metabolism affected by zinc enrichment. Furthermore, the antioxidant properties of the zinc-enriched strain, including radical scavenging capacity and the antioxidative enzyme activity increased significantly. These results suggest that zinc addition had a positive effect on the physiologic function of L. plantarum DNZ-4.

J		Yueyue Yang; Aiquan Jiao; Qing Liu; Xiaoru Ren; Kunfu Zhu; Zhengyu Jin							The effects of removing endogenous proteins, beta-glucan and lipids on the surface microstructure, water migration and glucose diffusion in vitro of starch in highland barley flour.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of removing non-starch components on the surface microstructure, water migration and glucose diffusion rate of highland barley starch (HBS) were systematically studied to reveal the models that affect the digestibility of HBS. The results of scanning electron micrographs, confocal laser scanning microscopy, polarization cross and particle size distribution showed that there were two particle size ranges in highland barley flour, large (73.99-591.90 mum) and small (<73.99 mum). Partial beta-glucan and proteins form a compact and continuous matrix on the surface of HBS granules; lipids can partly be adsorbed on the surface of HBS granules, while other lipids, proteins and beta-glucan are scattered around HBS granules. After the removal of non-starch components, the ratio of large particles decreased and the starch granules were more exposed, especially proteins and beta-glucan. The results of low-field nuclear magnetic resonance investigation showed that the water migration rate was accelerated after the removal of beta-glucan, and partial free water was transformed into weakly bound water, while the opposite effect was observed for the removal of proteins and lipids. The glucose diffusion rate in vitro was unchanged after the removal of lipids, while the removal of beta-glucan significantly accelerated the diffusion of glucose in vitro. This study reveals that the effective models of HBS inhibited by non-starch components is the compact matrix mainly formed by proteins and beta-glucan on the surface of HBS granules. Additionally, the rate of glucose diffusion across the small intestinal wall could be considered as one of the means of constructing slowly digestible starch.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. To investigate the anti-ageing and anti-diabetic effects of Enteromorpha prolifera oligosaccharide (EPO) in age-matched streptozocin-induced diabetic mice. Methods and Results. LC-MS metabolomics and 16S rRNA sequencing is used to identify the brain metabolites and gut microbiota, respectively. EPO could significantly improve glucose metabolism and activity of total superoxide dismutase in serum. It also could regulate the tricarboxylic acid cycle, arginine, and inosine-related metabolic pathways in the brain of aged diabetic mice. Inosine is found to enhance the relative expressions of daf-2, daf-16, and skn-1 in insulin-resistant Caenorhabditis elegans. Additionally, EPO could alter the composition and diversity of gut microbiota in mice. It could upregulate the Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3/Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1)/B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6) pathways in the brain and the c-Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK)/FOXO1/Bcl-6 signaling axis in the intestine to regulate glucose metabolite status and ageing in mice. EPO could also improve the levels of glucagon-like peptide type 1 (GLP1) expression in the gut, thereby inducing high expression of GLP1 receptor in the brain to control glucose metabolites through the brain-gut axis. Enterococcus is negatively correlated with AMP in the brain and could be a potential hallmark species in age-related diabetes. Conclusions. These results suggest that EPO could be a potential novel natural drug for the treatment of diabetes in the elderly. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	4			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100564					FSTA:2022-06-Rg2289

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Chitosan and phenolic acid were catalysed by 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) /1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) to produce graft copolymer with high performance. The grafting ratios of gallic acid-grafted chitosan copolymer (GA-CS, 16.58%) and protocatechuic acid-grafted chitosan copolymer (PCA-CS, 14.36%) were determined by ultraviolet-visible spectrometer. The characterisation of products was analysed by Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, proton nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The water solubility of natural chitosan (NA-CS, 5.63%), GA-CS (45.05%) and PCA-CS (85.96%) confirmed that the water solubility of the modified chitosan enhanced after the existence of phenolic acid. 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl hydrazine (DPPH) scavenging test, beta-carotene rinsing experiment, total reducing power determination and standard agar well diffusion assay method were used to evaluate the antioxidant capacity and antibacterial ability of copolymer. Notably, the antibacterial ability of PCA-CS and GA-CS remained relatively consistent, but GA-CS has the highest antioxidant capacity. This study shows that the EDC/HOBt reaction system can successfully graft phenolic acids onto chitosan without affecting the bioactivity of phenolic acids. In addition, the preparation of food preservation coatings by phenolic acid-chitosan copolymers with high antibacterial and antioxidant properties will have great development potential in the field of food technology. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	12	7806	7815	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16097					FSTA:2023-03-Ae4915

Food Chemistry					We propose a new ultrasound-assisted salt (NaCl) Oleosin extraction method, where the addition of NaCl induces the dissociation of Oleosin subunits and promotes the unfolding of the protein spatial structure. The yield of Oleosin post extraction and purification and solubility of Oleosin obtained using the proposed method were higher than those of Oleosin extracted using traditional methods, by 17.6% and 122.9%, respectively; reduction in particle size (to 52 nm) was also noted. Hydrogen bond dissociation, increase in surface hydrophobicity, and disulfide bond formation occurred simultaneously. However, the overall structure of Oleosin was not negatively affected. The physical properties of Oleosin, such as water and oil absorption, emulsification, and antioxidant activity, were improved, and the rate of Oleosin digestion decreased during the in vitro simulated digestion process. The proposed method provides a theoretical basis for producing proteins. This method can be utilized for effective extraction of Oleosin to achieve sustained release of the produced proteins.

Food Hydrocolloids					Curcumin is often used as a natural food additive because of its many drug functions and biological properties; however, its poor water solubility, chemical instability, ease of degradation, relatively high rate of metabolic degradation, and low bioavailability has limited its use in functional foods and medicines. In this study, we prepared curcumin oil body (COB) emulsions by loading curcumin into soybean slurry and explored the structural characteristics of emulsions prepared using different ultrasound sequences with the aim of enhancing the functionality and digestion properties of the oil bodies. The measured encapsulation efficiencies, particle sizes, zeta-potentials, Turbiscan stability indices, and other indicators reveal that the best COB encapsulation efficiency and stability are obtained using two ultrasound treatment methods and the addition of 10% oil. Structural analysis using infrared spectroscopy and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis revealed that the curcumin-loaded oil was mainly bound to the hydrophobic area of the protein on the surface of the oil body through hydrophobic interactions. COB stability was found to positively correlate with the amount of extrinsic protein adsorbed on the surfaces of the oil droplets. Digestion data showed that, compared with the method in which the oil body is prepared and then loaded with curcumin (COB-U), the COB prepared by direct ultrasonication in the soybean slurry (U-COB) realizes sustained oil release in the intestine. U-COB also exhibits higher bioavailability (67.42%), which is important for creating a more effective curcumin delivery system.

Male mice were used, 12 for each of the 2 groups: a control group that received sterile distilled water and a treated group that received goat milk, and gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance genes were compared in these groups using metagenomic analysis. The results revealed that ingestion of goat milk decreased the diversity and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes in the mice gut. The relative abundance of fluoroquinolone, peptide, macrolide, and beta-lactam resistance genes in the total microbial genes significantly decreased after the intervention. Goat milk intake also significantly reduced the abundance of pathogenic bacteria, such as Clostridium bolteae, Clostridium symbiosum, Helicobacter cinaedi, and Helicobacter bilis. Therefore, goat milk intake might decrease the transfer potential of antibiotic resistance gene to pathogenic bacteria in the gut. In addition, bacteria with multiple resistance mechanisms accounted for approximately 4.5% of total microbial communities in the control group, whereas it was not detectable in the goat milk group, indicating the total inhibition by goat milk intake. This study highlights the influence of goat milk on antibiotic resistome and microbial communities in the gut, and provides a new insight into the function of goat milk for further study.

J		Yufang Liu; Fuxin Zhang							Comparison of whole goat milk and its major fractions regarding the modulation of gut microbiota.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Goat milk can be important for human nutrition because of its nutritional value, which may be attributed to its richness in protein, lactose, fat, and other bioactive components. This study compared the diversity and composition of gut microbiota in response to whole goat milk and its major fractions (milk fat, casein, milk whey, whey protein, and whey supernatant). Goat milk, its major fractions, and sterile distilled water (for the control group) were administered to mice intragastrically, and gut microbiota were compared in these groups using metagenomic analysis. Results. We observed distinct patterns of gut microbiota from different diet groups. The sample distance heatmap showed that, compared with other goat milk fractions, gut microbiota in the casein group was more similar to that in the whole goat-milk group. The relative abundance of the genus Lactobacillus increased significantly after whole goat-milk treatment; the milk whey fraction increased the abundance of Blautia; milk fat and milk whey related fractions treatment promoted the population of Bacteroides. The network analysis showed that genera Lactobacillus and Lactococcus were negatively associated with Helicobacter and Acinetobacter, respectively. Conclusion. Fractions of goat milk could contain different gut microbiota from whole goat milk. Consumption of certain goat milk fractions could increase the ingestion of beneficial bacteria and inhibit the growth of some pathogenic bacteria. Our results could provide the basis for the research into and development of goat-milk based functional foods. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	9	3618	3627	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11708					FSTA:2022-10-Pe4657

Foods					Sensory characteristics of products play an essential role on the consumer's acceptability, preference and consuming behavior choice. The sensory profiles and consumer hedonic perception for 14 UHT milk products using sensory quantitatively descriptive analysis and a 9-point hedonic scale were investigated in this study. There were significant differences in the sensory attributes intensity and liking scores among the organic whole milk, ordinary whole milk, low-fat milk, and skimmed milk (p< 0.05). Skimmed milk samples had lowest intensity scores of typical milk aroma, taste flavor and texture attributes, as well as had the lowest overall liking scores. Whole milk samples had higher sensory intensity scores than low-fat milk samples, even though no significant differences of overall liking scores were observed between whole milk and low-fat milk. Furthermore, the relationship between the sensory attribute and overall liking was demonstrated according to correlation analysis and partial least squares regression (PLSR) analysis. Overall liking increased significantly with the increasing of sweet, after milk aroma, protein-like, mellow and thick, while decreased significantly with the enhancement of cowy, cooked and whey (p< 0.05). These findings presented a potential strategy for identifying the key sensory attributes responsible for liking score differences among different kinds of UHT milk products. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Analytical Methods					Developing reliable and sensitive sensing technologies for food toxin detection would have significant food safety and human health benefits. An ultrasensitive dual-mode counterpropagating-responsive assay was successfully developed for the detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) in this work. Based on changed fluorescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals derived from gold nanoparticle-encapsulated metal-organic framework (AuNPs@MIL-101) nanostructures, the concentration of SEB that existed in food sample can be efficiently quantified in the ranges of 1-500 pg/mL and 1-750 pg/mL, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) of the novel assay can be as low as 0.5 pg/mL and 0.2 pg/mL (S/N = 3), respectively. In addition, the selectivity experiment results indicate this assay has a high selectivity over other commonly encountered food toxins. The practicability of the novel assay was investigated by detecting the concentration of SEB in actual food samples. The average recoveries range from 88.80 to 108.25%, revealing satisfactory application potential of the proposed assay. With the merits of high reliability and accuracy, we believe that the proposed dual-mode assay has a promising prospect in food toxins detection. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	15	5	1368	1376	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02204-z					FSTA:2023-01-Cd0277
J		Yufen Liu; Haiyan Gao; Jie Zeng; Keke Zhang; Yunfei Dai							Effect of canna edulis ker flour on quality of quick-frozen dumpling wrappers.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Canna edulis ker flour (CEKF) is one of the best substitutes for wheat flour. The properties of its mixed powder and its effects on the product quality are the focus of the research. The optimal addition amount of CEKF in dumpling wrappers and the changes of 20% CEKF frozen dumpling wrappers stored at different temperatures were investigated. The results showed that the optimal amount of CEKF was 20%, which showed the longest stabilization time, the smallest weakening degree, the best texture properties, and the short cooking time. When frozen storage at different temperatures for 15 days, the texture of dumpling wrappers containing 20% CEKF at -12°C was closer to the samples at -24°C. There were no obvious differences in color, water migration, and microstructure between -12°C and -18°C. In short, the quality of dumpling wrappers frozen at -12°C and -18°C was similar. Novelty impact statement. The dumpling wrappers containing 20% canna edulis ker flour (CEKF) had the best texture properties and a shorter cooking time. The dumpling wrappers containing 20% CEKF were frozen and stored at different temperatures for 15 days, and it was found that the quality of the dumpling wrappers frozen at -12°C and -18°C was similar. It provides a new way to improve the quality of dumpling wrappers in the selection of the supplementary materials, expands the application range of CEKF in food, and provides a certain theoretical basis for the frozen storage temperature of dumpling wrappers. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16516					FSTA:2022-09-Mq5324
J		Yufeng He; Liya Mei; Luyao Wang; Xiu Li; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Wei Chen; Gang Wang							Lactiplantibacillus plantarum CCFM1019 attenuate polycystic ovary syndrome through butyrate dependent gut-brain mechanism.		Food & Function					Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine disorder that affects women of reproductive age. The gut microbiota has been shown to play a vital role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Agents that target microbes in the gut may be promising therapeutic strategies for PCOS. Herein, a letrozole-induced PCOS model was used to test five Lactiplantibacillus plantarum strains for their ability to alleviate PCOS symptoms and their effect on the gut-brain axis. Lp. plantarum CCFM1019 attenuated the pathological changes in the ovaries and restored testosterone and luteinising hormone levels. However, metabolic disorders induced by letrozole treatment were not significantly reversed by these strains. Meanwhile, alteration of gut microbial diversity and enrichment of the short-chain fatty acid producers Lachnospira and Ruminococcus_2 were observed after Lp. plantarum CCFM1019 intervention. Compared with letrozole-treated rats, those treated with Lp. plantarum CCFM1019 exhibited higher butyrate and polypeptide YY levels, possibly due to the regulation of G protein-coupled receptor 41 expression. These results demonstrated that Lp. plantarum CCFM1019 attenuated letrozole-induced PCOS symptoms in rats. A butyrate-dependent gut-brain mechanism may be involved in this protective effect. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.										2022	13	3	1380	1392	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01744f					FSTA:2022-06-Ad8838

Food Chemistry					Effects of sodium ascorbate (1%, 2%, 3%) on the liquefaction of alkali-induced egg white gel (EWG) were investigated. Results showed hardness and water holding capacity (WHC) gradually decreased at 1%. However, hardness and WHC declined and then rose at 2% and 3%. Microstructural changes further confirmed the effects of sodium ascorbate on hardness and WHC. Electrophoresis showed sodium ascorbate caused the cross-linking between proteins, which was more resistant to degradation. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and surface hydrophobicity indicated sodium ascorbate significantly changed protein structure, especially at 2% and 3% resulted in protein reaggregation, increasing beta-sheet, and decreasing surface hydrophobicity in the later stage. In general, sodium ascorbate didn't inhibit the liquefaction of alkali-induced EWG at 1%, but did effectively at 2% and 3%. Therefore, high concentrations of sodium ascorbate possess the potential to inhibit the "alkali injury liquefaction" of preserved egg whites without heavy metals.

J		Yufeng Lai; Albert Boaitey; Kota Minegishi							Behind the veil: social desirability bias and animal welfare ballot initiatives.		Food Policy					Farm animal welfare (FAW) issues are becoming increasingly political in many countries, as evidenced by the increased use of regulations, legislation, and ballot initiatives. Available empirical evidence however, indicates that consumer valuation of improved animal welfare is low, although positive. As a result of the sensitive nature of FAW issues, public preferences for improved FAW standards can be susceptible to social desirability bias leading to disparities between regulatory standards and the public's "true" preferences. Given the potential negative impacts of high mandated FAW standards on food costs and the associated consumer and producer welfare losses, this study examined the issue of effective public preference elicitation in animal welfare ballot initiatives. Specifically, we examined social desirability, the tendency to conform to the social norms, and its role in generating overenthusiasm in the support for FAW issues and policy instruments. We used data from an opt-in survey of respondents and compared results of a List Experiments (LE) to a conventional (direct) survey format. Our results show that public support for the FAW issues examined was consistently overestimated when elicited with the conventional survey format. We discuss the implications of these outcomes for animal welfare policy and offer suggestions to researchers and practitioners eliciting preferences in other sensitive food policy contexts.

Food Chemistry					New polyphenol-protein conjugates were successfully prepared by covalently crosslinking soluble Antarctic krill proteins with rutin (SAKPs-rutin). The physico-chemical and functional properties of SAKPs-rutin conjugates were systematically evaluated by measuring the changes in interfacial tension, structural conformation, and emulsifying ability, etc. The results showed that SAKPs-rutin conjugates possessed higher surface hydrophobicity, surface charge, and thermal denaturation temperature, and lower beta-sheet conformation compared to native SAKPs. On this basis, the interfacial tension of SAKPs-rutin conjugates was reduced, which greatly contributed to the formation of denser and more ordered networks at the oil-water interface. Meanwhile, the emulsifier endowed the fabricated high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) with excellent physical performance and oxidative stability, evidenced by low peroxide values (POV) and malondialdehyde (MDA) after the treatment of long-term storage (15d), heating (65 °C) and UV light treatment. These findings suggest that SAKPs-rutin conjugates are a novel and promising food resource for preparing food-grade emulsions.

Food Research International					This study firstly constructed a new method of basic electrolyzed water coupled with ultrasonic (USBEW) to creatively modify the Antarctic krill proteins (AKPs), and its effects on amino acid composition, structural and functional properties, as well as in vitro digestibility of AKPs were evaluated. Results showed that BEW inhibited the production of 1O2 and .OH radicals from ultrasonic treatment. In comparison with the deionized water coupled with ultrasonic (USDW) treatment, the USBEW treatment effectively reduced the oxidation of active groups (carbonyl and free sulfhydryl) in the side chain of amino acids of the AKPs, and it also obviously decreased the particle size (18.6 nm), improved the solubility (13.2 %), increased the molecules flexibility and the surface hydrophobicity of AKPs. All these advantageous changes contributed to the improved foam stability, foam capacity and emulsifying properties of AKPs. More importantly, the in vitro digestibility (84.6 %) of AKPs treated by USBEW was significantly higher than that any control samples. Our results prove that the USBEW treatment is a valid and promising method to exploit novel marine protein products with a high nutritional quality.

Foods					The physiological and biochemical characters of muscles derived from pasture-fed or barn-fed black goats were detected, and RNA-seq was performed to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms to identify how the pasture feeding affected the nutrition and flavor of the meat. We found that the branched chain amino acids, unsaturated fatty acids, and zinc in the muscle of pasture-fed goats were significantly higher than those in the barn-fed group, while the heavy metal elements, cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly lower. RNA-seq results showed that 1761 genes and 147 lncRNA transcripts were significantly differentially expressed between the pasture-fed and barn-fed group. Further analysis found that the differentially expressed genes were mainly enriched in the myogenesis and Glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. A functional analysis of the lncRNA transcripts further highlighted the difference in fatty acid metabolism between the two feeding models. Our study provides novel insights into the gene regulation and network organization of muscles and could be potentially used for improving the quality of mutton. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of AOAC International					Background. Plumeriae rubrae flos, the dried flowers of Plumeria rubra cv. acutifolia (PRCA), is one of the most important materials of herbal tea in China. Recently, due to the lack of effective quality evaluation standards, it has been found that Plumeria rubra (PR) and Plumeria rubravar.alba (PRVA) were pretended to be PRCA in herbal material markets. Objective. To establish an effective method for comprehensive quality assessment on plumeriae rubrae flos, and distinguishing PRCA from its common adulterants, PR and PRVA. Method. In this study, a method combined application of ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS), UHPLC with a diode array detector (UHPLC-DAD), and chemometrics was developed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of PRCA, PR, and PRVA, based on their multiple components. Results. A total of 26 components were identified by UHPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, including nine flavonoids, eight iridoids, seven phenolic acids, and two coumarins from PRCA. Quantified fingerprints were established and validated using UHPLC-DAD based on 18 chemical markers in PRCA, PR, and PRVA samples. The multivariate statistical analysis of quantitative results demonstrated clear discrimination of PRCA, PR, and PRVA, which indicated that isoquercetin, luteolin-3′-O-beta-D-glucoside, 15-demethylplumieride P-E-coumarate, and 4-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-cis-coumaric acid could be considered the most obvious characteristic components for distinguishing PRCA from PR and PRVA. Conclusions. A combination of quantitative fingerprint and chemometrics analysis provided an effective and reliable strategy for the quality control of PRCA. Highlights. The current study was prospected to apply a comprehensive quality control method for plumeriae rubrae flos. © The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of AOAC INTERNATIONAL.

Foods					In order to promote the development and utilization of coconut haustorium (CH). The basic chemical composition, volatile profiles and antioxidant activities of three haustoria with different transverse diameters were investigated. Results. Showed large coconut haustorium (LCH) contained more soluble sugar (47.10%) and reducing sugar (17.68%), while small coconut haustorium (SCH) possessed more ash (10.17%), protein (9.22%) and fat (5.03%). All CH were rich in potassium (4.06-4.69%) and phosphorus (0.39-0.50%). The fatty acid composition of SCH and amino acid composition of middle coconut haustorium (MCH) was more reasonable, which indicated its relatively higher nutritive value. Acids ranging from 26.90% to 60.82% were the dominant volatile components in CH, especially isobutyric acid whose relative content in SCH was up to 56.78%. The haustorium extract with polysaccharide as the main component has certain antioxidant activities, the half eliminating concentration (EC50 values) of LCH on hydroxyl radical and SCH on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) radical were 8.33,1.18 and 2.44mg/mL, respectively.

J		Yufeng Zhang; Minmin Tang; Fei Song; Yuanfen Wen; Niu Li; Youlin Zhang							The effects of different drying methods on the structural characteristics and bioactivities in vitro of polysaccharides from coconut (Cocos nucifera L.) water.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The purpose of this study was to explore the effects of different drying methods included hot air (HD), vacuum (VD) and freezing drying (FD) on the chemical composition, structural characteristics, antioxidant activities and glucose consumption of HepG2 cells in vitro of coconut water polysaccharides (CWPs). Results showed that drying methods had significant effects on the contents of neutral sugars and total phenols, the size and distribution of molecular weight, biological activities in vitro of CWPs. All CWPs composed of six monosaccharides including rhamnose, arabinose, galactose, glucose, xylose and galacturonic acid were small molecule acidic heteropolysaccharide containing pyranoid ring structure and a-glycosidic linkages. And the CWP-HD, CWP-VD and CWP-FD would not decompose when the temperature was lower than 183.76°C, 182.75°C and 176.48°C. Furthermore, CWP-HD had the best DPPH (IC50 value of 0.21 0.001mg/mL) and ABTS radical scavenging ability (IC50 value of 5.44 0.05mg/mL), while CWP-FD had the best hydroxyl radical scavenging ability (IC50 value of 20.80 0.002mg/mL) and promoting effect on glucose consumption of HepG2 cells. These could provide support for the high-value development and utilization of coconut water. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	4	2499	2509	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01346-w					FSTA:2023-02-Js2101
J		Yufeng Zou; Jianbo Zhang; Yumin Niu; Dengyong Liu							Identification of key constituent of sugar-smoking pigment and its photobleaching, antioxidant and antiproliferative properties.		Food Research International					The key constituent(s) of sugar-smoking brown pigments were identified, the chemical and biological properties were subsequently investigated, and the possibility of obtaining it from nature was explored. A pigment was isolated, which was identified as condensation product of 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfuraldehyde (5-HMF) with glucose: 5-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-(1-6)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyloxymenthyl)-2-furancarboxaldehyde (5-GGMF). The molecular weight was 450.00. The interaction between pigment with protein on chicken skin was mainly via hydrogen and carbon-hydrogen bonds. It was obtained by caramelization instead of Maillard reaction. Discoloration of sugar-smoking pigments were mainly due to cleavage of chromophores caused by the oxidation reaction followed by photobleaching mechanism. Both radical scavenging and antiproliferative capacity of sugar-smoking pigment were in a dose-dependent manner. However, the IC50 values for HepG2 and PANC-1 cells differed by more than ten times. Since 5-GGMF is also present in plant resources (like Rehmanniae Radix), it can be obtained as natural additive to produce clean label sugar-smoked meat products.

J		Yugang Liu; Shuangshuang Ma; Huiping Xia; Shiyin Guo; Chaoxi Zeng							Edible oleogels stabilized solely by stigmasterol: effect of oil type and gelator concentration.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Phytosterols are considered to be one of the most promising gelators for obtaining oleogel because of their additional health benefits and natural coexist with vegetable oils. Previous studies have confirmed that individual phytosterols are not capable of structuring vegetable oils unless they act synergistically with other components. However, based on the self-assembly properties of stigmasterol (ST) in organic solvents, we speculate that it can also structure vegetable oils as a gelator alone. Results. For the first time, the present study confirmed the feasibility of using ST alone as a gelator for structuring of vegetable oils, including rapeseed oil (RSO), olive oil (OLO) and flaxseed oil (FSO). RSO had the lowest ST gelation concentration (4%, w/w), and the oil-binding capacity and firmness value of the oleogels were the highest. The rheological results showed that all the samples were gelatinous (G′> G). The results of differential scanning calorimeter and X-ray diffraction further confirmed that the properties of RSO-based oleogels are superior to those prepared by OLO and FSO. The microscopic results also confirmed that the crystal structure of RSO oleogels was more uniform, smaller and more densely distributed. Conclusion. The structural properties of the oleogels were positively correlated with the ST concentration, and various analysis indicators showed that the performance of the oleogel based on RSO was better than that of OLO and FSO. In summary, the present study used ST as a gelator to successfully prepare oleogels with excellent properties, which provides a feasible reference for researchers in related fields. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4759	4769	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11841					FSTA:2022-11-Ne2518

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The wild bitter gourd (WBG) is a commonly consumed vegetable in Asia that has antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-adipogenic activities of isolated compounds from WBG on 8-day differentiated cultures of 3 T3-L1 adipocytes that were then stained with Oil Red O (ORO) or diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Results. ORO stains of the methanol extracts of de-seeded HM86 cultivar of WBG (WBG-M) and the ethyl acetate fractions (WBG-M-EA) showed anti-adipogenic activities against differentiated adipocytes. Two chlorophyll-degraded compounds, pheophorbide a (1) and pyropheophorbide a (2), were isolated from WBG-M-EA. Treatments with 1 (5, 10, and 20mumolL-1) and 2 (2.5, 5, and 10mumolL-1) showed dose-dependent reductions in lipid accumulations and reduced nuclear DAPI stains in differentiated 3 T3-L1 adipocytes. The concentrations for 50% inhibition against lipid accumulations of 1 and 2, respectively, were 16.05 and 7.04mumolL-1. Treatments with 1 and 2 showed enhanced lactate dehydrogenase release in the first 4-day cell mitotic clonal expansions during the differentiating cultural processes, although the effect was less on the non-differentiating cultural processes. Thus, 1 and 2 were more toxic to differentiating adipocytes than to non-differentiated pre-adipocytes, which partly resulted in anti-adipogenic activities with lowered lipid accumulations. Conclusion. Both 1 and 2 showed anti-adipogenic activities in cell models. These chlorophyll-degraded compounds commonly exist in several vegetables during storage or edible seaweeds, which will provide resources for further investigations aiming to test anti-obesity in animal studies. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	14	6771	6779	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12044					FSTA:2023-01-Jq1558
J		Yuhan Cheng; Yu Wang; Tuo Leng; Liwen Zhu; Ying Jing; Jianhua Xie; Qiang Yu; Yi Chen							Feasibility study on prediction of the grain mixtures for black sesame paste recipe with different chemometric methods.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					An attractive strategy for quantitative analysis of the grain mixtures for black sesame paste was proposed in this research by combined application of FT-IR spectroscopy and chemometrics. The FT-IR spectra of three grain (black sesame, black rice, and black bean) mixtures, which are used for producing black sesame paste were collected. Based on the FT-IR spectra, different regression methods were utilized and optimized to estimate each mixture component content. The PCA-Class results revealed that each mixture class was highly distinct and allowed discrimination from others. PLSR, siPLS, and PCR were comparatively performed to calibrate regression models. The optimal model was achieved with the R2 higher than 0.98 and the RMSE less than 4. The identification results of hold-out validation samples proved the accuracy of the model and indicated that PCR was the most suitable regression model. The results indicate that FT-IR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics could be potentially applied in the industry for quantitative analysis of mixed foods in the future.

Food Chemistry					In this work, triazine-based porous organic polymer (TAPT-BPDA) synthesized by simple solvothermal method with stable chemical properties was employed as pipette tip solid-phase extraction (PT-SPE) adsorbent for the extraction of sulfonamides for the first time. Under the optimal conditions, good linearities (1-300mug L-1, R2 ≥ 0.9987) and low limits of detection (0.10-0.28mug L-1) were obtained. The recoveries of sulfonamides in meat, egg and milk samples were in the range of 76.1-114.0 %. The prepared TAPT-BPDA showed good reusability with the recoveries of sulfonamides remained above 80.0 % after eight recycles. The adsorption mechanism between SAs and adsorbent might be the combined effects of electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions. The results demonstrated potential applications of a TAPT-BPDA-based PT-SPE-HPLC method for the analysis of trace sulfonamide residues in food samples.

Food Chemistry					Zearalenone (ZEN) poses a serious threat to human and animal health. The development of sensitive determination methods for ZEN is of great significance for ensuring the quality and safety of food. Herein, based on a stimuli-responsive aptamer-functionalized metal-organic framework (MOF) nano-container and trivalent DNA peroxidase mimicking enzyme (DNAzyme), an efficient aptasensor was constructed initially for the colorimetric determination of ZEN. The proposed aptasensor only required simple operations but exhibited outstanding specificity, reproducibility, storage stability and reusability simultaneously. Under the optimal conditions, there was a good linear relationship between the changed absorbance and logarithm concentration of ZEN within 0.01-100 ng mL-1, and the limit of detection (LOD) could reach 0.36 pg mL-1. Moreover, the proposed aptasensor was reliable in quantifying ZEN in spiked food samples. The current bioassay provides a promising scheme for constructing stable, specific and rapid colorimetric platforms with potential applications in the fields of food safety.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The accumulation of organic selenium (Se) by lactic acid bacteria (LAB) showed excellent biosafety and absorption efficiency. Identification of Se-enriched strains and the production of Se-enriched products by fermentation are popular research areas. However, there are few studies that focus on the distribution characteristics of Se in cells. In this study, a Se-enriched dominant Lactobacillus paracasei 20241 was selected to characterize the distribution of Se on the cell surface and inside the cell. The results showed that L. paracei can convert sodium selenite into zero-valent Se and organic Se. The former was then released outside the cell and the latter was combined with cell components. The content of organic Se in the cells was 2144.99 123.16mug/g, accounting for 52.73% of the total Se. Compared with cellular polysaccharide and nucleic acid, protein exhibited the highest Se binding ability of 864.03 26.04mug/g, indicating that the main form of organic Se was selenoprotein. Thus, Lactobacillus paracasei 20241 is expected to be used as a dietary supplement for Se-enrich biomass probiotics.

J		Yuhan Sun; Yuan Gan; Lin Zhang; Yiheng Shi; Tianli Yue; Yahong Yuan							Isolation and identification of Monascus and evaluation of its selenium accumulation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Selenium (Se) plays an important role in human physiological metabolism. Se-enriched microorganism could be a remedy for Se-deficiency related diseases. Monascus are acid-resistant, saprophytic, filamentous and edible fungi which are widely used in the food fermentation industry. However, studies on Se-biofortification almost ignore the possibility of applications in Monascus. In this work, a Monascus purpureus, M12 was isolated from the collected samples and used for Se-resistant testing and Se-enrichment domestication. The results showed M12 hold strong ability to tolerate exogenously applied inorganic Se. At all concentrations of sodium selenite, the strain can enter the growth boom period within 2 d, without a lag period. The total selenium content in M12 was between 1400 and 2000 mug/g. When the concentration of sodium selenite was between 40 and 90 mug/mL, the utilization rate of inorganic Se reached 99%. The optimal conditions for Se accumulation were also optimized by determining the total Se, organic Se content in fungal cell. The Se enrichment ability of Monascus provides a new potential for dietary Se supplementation.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Current medications used to treat alcoholic liver injury (ALD) can cause secondary damage to the liver. Therefore, it is important to improve alcoholic liver injury from the perspective of dietary and nutritional supplementation. Nucleic acids, as functional biomolecules, are present in almost all foods, especially in aquatic products, but their edible research has been neglected for a long time. Hence, the effects of a typical aquatic nucleic acid, namely, salmon sperm DNA, in acute, and chronic alcoholic liver injury model of male ICR mice were studied. The results showed that salmon sperm DNA significantly attenuated the accumulation of cholesterol (TC) and triglycerides (TG) in acute alcoholic liver injury, and it was further demonstrated to mainly regulate lipid metabolism by fluorescent quantitative PCR and immunoblotting experiments. In addition, nucleic acid intervention alleviated inflammation and apoptosis in mice with chronic alcoholic liver injury. Practical applications. These results suggest that salmon sperm DNA can prevent and ameliorate alcoholic liver injury and can be used as an effective dietary and nutritional supplement for the prevention and treatment of ALD. Moreover, this study provided some new ideas for the development and utilization of large aquatic nucleic acid resources, promoted the comprehensive use of fish processing waste, such as fish sperm, and provided new directions for reducing emissions. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14346					FSTA:2023-02-Rc0561

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					To elucidate the puffing characteristics of the berry slice under continuous microwave conditions, heat and mass transfer and deformation of slices were investigated based on the models of coupled multi-physics fields involving electromagnetic heating, heat and mass transfer and solid mechanics. The results indicated that transmission mode of microwaves in a microwave cavity determined the electric field distribution inside slices with interior focusing phenomenon described by higher temperature and lower moisture content at the central region of slices than that of edge. The berry slice volume showed a "invisible-rapid-maintained" deformation under the synergistic effects of temperature, moisture and internal pressure with sample movement. This study may provide guidance for the elucidation of microwave puffing process of the moving slice and the underlying applications such as technology optimization and quality control of slices like berry. Novelty impact statement. This work investigates the puffing characteristics of the moving berry slices under a continuous microwave dryer, and elucidates the heat and mass transfer and deformation process of berry slices by means of experiment and simulation. The distribution of alternating electric field profiles with high and low levels determine the absorption of microwave energy, heat and mass transfer in berry slices to induce the volume deformation and uneven distribution. The volume of berry slices laid on moving conveyor belt under continuous microwave puffing undergoes three deformation trends as invisible change followed by rapid expansion till desired shape. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16838					FSTA:2023-03-Jf4023

C.; Xingguo Wang							Formation of dark chocolate fats with improved heat stability and desirable miscibility by blending cocoa butter with mango kernel fat stearin and hard palm-mid fraction.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Softening and fat bloom are serious quality defects for dark chocolates, which mainly results from insufficient melting characteristics of cocoa butter (CB) and more likely to occur in countries with warm and hot climates. Mango kernel fat stearin (MKFS) and hard palm-mid fraction (HPMF) share similar triacylglycerol structure to CB. They can hopefully be used to improve both heat and bloom stabilities, making them suitable for use in hot climates. In the present study, chocolate fats blended with 70% CB, 25-30% MKFS, and 0-5% HPMF contributed to forming miscible triacylglycerol compositions containing 35.6-39.1% 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, 34.0% 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-3-stearoyl-glycerol, and 12.4-16.0% of 1,3-dipalmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol. Such desirable compositions made the fats significantly harder than CB. Their melting points ranged from 29.0 to 29.4 to 40.3-40.7°C; in contrast, CB melted from 27.5 to 38.1°C. The prepared fats and CB exhibited desirable beta crystals through tempering, which is consistent with the results of microstructure, forming feather-like crystals. These attributes may help in formulating dark chocolates with improved heat and fat bloom stabilities.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					The lack of precise equilibrium gas permeability affects the application of edible coatings. This study aims to precisely control the coating oxygen permeability through layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly. The coatings fabricated by chitosan (CS) and sodium alginate (SA) were systematically investigated about assembly mechanism, growth law, barrier performance, and application. Results showed that coating assembly was driven by the electrostatic interaction between CS and SA. The fastest coating growth was the pH of SA and CS at 4 and the NaCl concentration at 0.1mol/L. The coating with a specific barrier performance had been proved to be accurately fabricated by adjusting the assembly concentration and times. Finally, coating combinations with the desired oxygen-barriers for strawberries, tangerines, and bananas were predicted based on the gas exchange model and fabricated by LbL. The physiological properties of the coated fruits indicated that the optimal LbL coating extended the shelf life of strawberries, tangerines and bananas by 2, 4, and 4 days, respectively. This research may help to precisely control the properties of coatings during the preparation and application of edible coatings. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	8	1778	1793	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-022-02848-7					FSTA:2022-11-Jb15741

F. Ching: purification, identification and in vitro bioactivities.		Food Chemistry					Chlorogenic acids are important phenolics in the fruits of wolfberry, but little attention has been paid on their glucosylated forms. In the present study, a glucosylated form of chlorogenic acid was isolated from the fruits of Lycium barbarum L. var. auranticarpum K. F. Ching (also called yellow wolfberry) and identified to be (-)-5-O-(3-O-beta-D-glucopyranosylcaffeoyl)-quinic acid (5-CQA-3′betaG) by high resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry. The content of 5-CQA-3′betaG in the dried fruit was determined as 0.0293 0.0015% by HPLC. In addition, 5-CQA-3′betaG showed a good scavenging capacity for 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylben-zothiazoline-6-sulphonate) free radicals but had a relatively low reducing power and scavenging capacity for 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical. Moreover, the secretion of nitric oxide, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 as well as related mRNA expression were reduced in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7macrophage cells treated with 5-CQA-3′betaG. This is the first report describing purification, identification and bioactivity of glucosylated CQA from yellow wolfberry.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is among the most prevalent chronic liver diseases around the globe. The accumulation of lipids in the liver and oxidative stress are important pathological mechanisms of NAFLD. Astaxanthin (AT) is a carotenoid extracted from shrimps and crabs with beneficial biological activities, including anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. 16S microflora sequencing, H & E staining, and the western blot technique were employed to investigate the impacts of AT on a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD. Significant mitigation in lipid metabolism-related disorders and decreased oxidative stress in HFD-induced mice were observed due to AT, and significant changes in the gut flora of the model mice were also observed. The in vitro study showed that AT considerably lowered the protein expression level of fatty acid synthetase (FAS), sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), and acetyl-COA carboxylase (ACC) and increased the protein expression of nuclear factor-E2 associated factor 2 (Nrf2) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in oleic acid (OA) and palmitic acid (PA)-induced HepG2 cells. Additionally, mechanistic studies revealed that compound C (AMPK inhibitor, CC) inhibited the regulatory effect of AT on the SREBP-1c and Nrf2 signaling pathways. In conclusion, AT can inhibit the SREBP-1c, FAS, and ACC signaling pathways, activate the AMPK and Nrf2 signaling pathways, and improve the structure of intestinal flora.										2022	70	34	10620	10634	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04476					FSTA:2023-01-Aj0245

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Mangiferin (MGF) is a phenolic compound isolated from mango, but its poor solubility significantly limits its use. In this study, MGF was embedded into the inner aqueous phase of W1/O/W2 emulsions. Firstly, the dissolution method of MGF was determined. MGF remained stable in solution with pH 13 at 30 min, and its solubility reached 10mgmL-1. When the pH of MGF solutions was adjusted from pH 13 to pH 6, MGF did not immediately crystallise, providing sufficient time to construct the MGF-loaded W1/O/W2 emulsions. Subsequently, the MGF-loaded W1/O/W2 emulsions were constructed using polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) and calcium caseinate (CAS). The formation and stability of the W1/O/W2 emulsions were investigated. The MGF-loaded W1/O/W2 emulsions stabilised with 1% PGPR and 1%-3% CAS exhibited a low viscosity, limited loading capacity, and poor stability. Conversely, the MGF-loaded W1/O/W2 emulsions stabilised by 3%PGPR-3%CAS exhibited optimal loading capacity (encapsulation efficiency = 95.31% and loading efficiency = 0.91%) and stability, which was attributed to the fact that high viscosity and gel state retarded the migration of inner aqueous phase. These results indicated that the W1/O/W2 emulsions stabilised by PGPR and CAS may be a potential alternative for encapsulating mangiferin. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	8	5268	5279	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15856					FSTA:2022-11-Jd15091

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Acetic acid bacteria (AAB) are widely used in acetic acid fermentation where the combined action of ethanol and acetic acid disturbs the cell viability. The present study investigated the ethanol resistance mechanisms through the comparisons between a more ethanol-tolerant Acetobacter pasteurianus JZ1601 and a less ethanol-tolerant A. pasteurianus 1.41 by focusing on the early stage of fermentation without acetic acid interference. While the membrane was the primary injury target, optimum membrane stability rather than increased membrane fluidity was demonstrated to be relevant to the ethanol tolerance. The weak membrane permeability entrusted JZ1601 with relatively reduced sublethal injury, low intracellular ethanol, and superior growth throughout the high ethanol challenge. However, the level of fatty acids could not play a direct role in improving the membrane stability. Furthermore, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, pyrroquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PQQ-ADH) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (PQQ-ALDH) activities were the potential to adapt to high ethanol challenges, with PQQ-ADH activity contributing more to the ethanol tolerance of JZ1601. These results demonstrated that the characteristic membrane structure, energy metabolism, and their improved adaptive regulation contributed to a high ethanol tolerance of AAB.

International Journal of Food Properties					The operation object of the meal-assisting robot is a non-rigid food individual with complex and differentiated physical characteristics, and the contact force between the spoon and the food is very complicated, which brings difficulties to the fetching of the food and has a large impact on the fetching rate and force of the foods. In this paper, the finite element simulation of the display algorithm is used to reproduce the scenario of the meal-assisting robot fetching food and verify the measurement method of viscoelasticity and friction coefficient of solid foods. A standard linear solid model in Maxwell form is characterized using moment relaxation and the model parameters are estimated. The tangential and normal forces obtained by the induced slippage method are used to estimate the friction coefficient of the contact surface of the food and the spoon. Simulation results show that the viscoelastic properties of solid foods can be characterized by moment relaxation, the parameters of the model can be estimated, and the friction coefficient can be measured by the induced slippage method. Finally, the effects of food traits and predetermined angular displacement on food fetching rates were verified by fetching a mixture of block and diced foods, and comparing the effects of different velocities on the moments and forces of action.

Journal of Food Science					The present study evaluated the rheological properties of galactomannan from Sesbania cannabina. The intrinsic viscosity of galactomannan was determined to be 8.63 0.06 dl/g. Moreover, the onset of galactomannan coil overlap occurred at 5.12 0.13g/L. With increasing concentration, galactomannan showed a more distinct shear-thinning behavior, which was well characterized by the Cross model. Notably, the viscosity of polysaccharide showed a negative relationship with the temperature, while the activation energy decreased with increasing polysaccharide concentration. Furthermore, at high concentrations, the galactomannan solution showed stability after heating or freezing, as well as over the wide pH range of 5.0-9.0. Dynamic viscoelasticity measurements reveal a gradual transition from viscous to elastic behavior of galactomannans with an increasing frequency. It is anticipated that S. cannabina galactomannan will find interesting applications as a natural thickener due to the comprehensive description of its rheological properties presented herein. Practical Application. The investigated S. cannabina galactomannan has shown a higher viscosity and heat stability at high concentration, as well as a good stability at the pH range of 5-9. The S. cannabina galactomannan may be employed as stabilizers in the food field. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	4	1527	1539	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16094					FSTA:2022-07-Tb2980

Journal of Cereal Science					High-moisture rice (HMR) has good processing and eating quality, but it is difficult to store for a long time. In this study, HMR was treated with a low dose (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kGy) of electron beam irradiation (EBI) and stored for 180 days. The storage properties, water changes, physicochemical properties, and eating quality of the HMR were analyzed. Results showed that after 180 days, the formation rate of lipase activity and fatty acid value, as well as the total viable bacterial count of rice grains decreased, and EBI promoted this process. Then, the moisture content decreased, and the physically absorbed water disappeared at the later stage of storage. Meanwhile, the internal structure of rice grains became loose during the water migration process. With prolonged storage time, the amylose content, and gelatinization viscosity of rice flour increased. In addition, EBI could delay the deterioration of the eating quality of HMR. These results demonstrated that EBI could be a new, green, and safe strategy for improving rice storage.

Food Bioscience					Flos Sophorae Immaturus (FSI) extract and its main active secondary metabolites have health benefits including antioxidant activity, but the drying process may negatively affect their quality and quantity. To investigate the effect of ultrasound-assisted freeze-drying (UAFD) on FSI, the drying rate, colour, and microstructure samples were analysed. Furthermore, the flavonoids and antioxidant activity of dried products were evaluated. The results showed that the drying rates were significantly enhanced with UAFD. At 600 W and 15 min, the drying time of UAFD was 40% shorter than that of freeze-drying (FD) alone. The micrographs showed that USAD created more porous structures that allowed water to migrate outward from inside the FSI tissue. Processing conditions of 600 W ultrasonic power and 5 min ultrasonication time produced better antioxidant activity in dried products than in other conditions. The highest characteristic properties were DPPH (75.51%), ABTS (95.14%), FRAP (83.05%), acceptable drying time (3 h), and low colour difference (1.09). Under these conditions, the contents of total flavonoids (298.34 mg/g), rutin (256.66 mg/g), quercetin (20.13 mg/g), kaempferol (19.64 mg/g), isorhamnetin (17.77 mg/g), and genistein (13.97 mg/g) were determined to be as indicated. The results confirmed the obvious benefits of incorporating the ultrasonic effect into the FD method.

Food Chemistry					Bisphenol A (BPA) is a worldwide used endocrine disrupting chemical that can migration from food containers and packaging, resulting in bioaccumulation of BPA in humans and causing adverse health effects. Porous electrodes have been proved with large surface areas and high sensing abilities in electrochemical detection of BPA. However, how to tailor the pore sizes to further improve the sensing performance is still a great challenge. Here, we delicately tailored the diameters of carbon nanofibers (CNFs) by adjusting electrospinning parameters to have optimal mesopore structure for strong adsorption of hemin that has been demonstrated with high electrocatalytic activity for BPA sensing. Benefiting from the optimal mesopores structure of CNFs and the synergistic effect of hemin and CNFs, this hemin@CNFs based sensor achieves an ultrahigh sensitivity of 40.97muA cm-2 muM-1, a low detection limit of 3.1 nM and satisfactory recoveries from 90.2% to 104.2% in the direct detection of BPA in liquors.

J		Yuhui Yang; Manman Lu; Yuncong Xu; Jing Qian; Guowei Le; Yanli Xie							High dietary methionine intake may contribute to the risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by inhibiting hepatic H2S production.		Food Research International					Methionine, an essential sulfur-containing amino acid, is associated with hepatic lipid accumulation; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different dietary methionine levels on hepatic lipid accumulation in mice and clarify the possible mechanisms involved. The Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice were fed a normal diet (ND, 0.86% methionine), high-methionine diet (HMD, 2.58% methionine), or methionine-restricted diet (MRD, 0.17% methionine) for 11 consecutive weeks. Our results showed that HMD increased the liver weight and liver index, plasma and hepatic lipid profiles, and hepatic fatty infiltration area and perirenal fat volume. In addition, HMD promoted lipid synthesis, inhibited lipid catabolism and glycolysis metabolism, reduced the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme complexes ( and V) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and elevated oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver. Moreover, HMD inhibited homocysteine metabolism and significantly decreased the expression and activity of cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (3-MST), thereby reducing endogenous H2S production in the liver. Interestingly, MRD reversed these adverse effects, and promoted endogenous H2S production. In conclusion, inhibition of hepatic H2S production may be the mechanism behind an increased risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with high dietary methionine intake. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce methionine intake in the daily diet to prevent NAFLD and maintain good physical health.

UHT treatment and storage of liquid infant formula affects protein digestion and release of bioactive peptides.		Food & Function					Ready-to-feed liquid infant formulas (IF) were subjected to direct (D) or indirect (ID) ultra-high-temperature (UHT) treatment and then stored at 40 °C under aseptic conditions for 60-120 days simulating global transportation which accelerates the Maillard reaction. Low pasteurized and unstored IF (LP) was included as a control for the UHT treatments. Simulated infant in vitro digestion was conducted. SDS-PAGE indicated that protein aggregate formation correlated with thermal treatment, being greatest after 60 days of storage. Limited protein digestion was observed after pepsin treatment for 2 h. Beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La) and protein aggregates remained undigested after 2 h of pepsin digestion in LP and D, but less beta-Lg and alpha-La remained in ID. The digestion of beta-Lg and alpha-La was enhanced in D and ID stored for 60 days, but aggregates remained undigested. After pepsin and pancreatin digestion, large amounts of beta-Lg remained undigested in the LP, but digestion increased after UHT treatment (ID > D) and increased further after storage for 60 and 120 days, indicating that heat treatment and storage facilitate the digestion of unaggregated proteins. No aggregates remained after pancreatin digestion of LP, D, ID and D stored for 60 days, but were present in ID stored for 60 days. Aggregates were mainly disulphide-linked, but dityrosine linkages were detected in D and ID stored for 120 days. LC-MS/MS indicated limited proteolysis arising from endogenous milk proteases prior to in vitro digestion, being highest in D. Peptide numbers increased following pepsin and further during pancreatin digestion (beta-casein > beta-Lg > beta-La), and released beta-Lg peptides, typically 5-8 amino acids in length, contained several bioactivities, e.g., dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	1	344	355	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02619d					FSTA:2022-04-Gc1784

Journal of Functional Foods					Resveratrol is a natural active ingredient found in many plants and has a protective effect on cardiovascular diseases. However, it has not been reported that whether resveratrol can inhibit calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). In this study, we want to explore the effect and mechanism of resveratrol on the osteogenic differentiation of valve interstitial cells (VICs). We first found that the expression of osteogenic markers in calcified human aortic valve. Western blotting, ALP staining and Alizarin red S staining showed that under osteogenic medium (OM) treatment, resveratrol can inhibit VICs from expressing osteogenic markers, reduce ALP content and calcium Nodule formation. Mechanistically, resveratrol can inhibit the activation of the AKT/Smad1/5/8 pathway induced by OM. We selected the AKT pathway for verification and determined that resveratrol inhibited the osteogenic differentiation of VICs by inhibiting the AKT pathway. Collectively, resveratrol may become a potential natural drug for the treatment of CAVD.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Curcumin, natural dietary ingredient, is considered as mild effective inhibitors for alpha-glucosidase to prevent type 2 diabetes. In this work, spectroscopic techniques combined with molecular simulation were used to further understand the inhibition kinetic mechanism of curcumin on alpha-glucosidase. Curcumin showed a mild inhibition effect (IC50 = 20.54 1.02mg/ml) for alpha-glucosidases through a competitive inhibition mechanism, and it led to fluorescence quenching as well as energy transfer by binding behaviour (average binding distance, r = 2.43nm). Hydrogen bonds and steric hindrance were the main interactions between curcumin and the activity site of alpha-glucosidases, as revealed by molecular docking. Circular dichroism spectroscopy results also indicate that curcumin affected the denaturation temperature of alpha-glucosidases, which dropped from 74°C to 68°C, resulting in inhibition. The findings can contribute to a better understanding of the development and application of curcumin in functional dietary food. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	5	2689	2700	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15433					FSTA:2022-08-Aj13228

Food Research International					Long-term exposure to UVB can trigger acute inflammation of the skin and lead to skin photoaging. To scrutinize the anti-photoaging functions of peptides obtained from milk, the physicochemical including molecular weight and amino acid compositions were first analyzed. Totally 267 peptides were screened out and identified by PEAKS X software, and then evaluated through Peptide Ranker and BIOPEP-UMW. Six peptides with the highest antioxidant ability and relative abundance were selected. This study was then conducted in UVB-damaged human foreskin fibroblasts with proadministration of peptides. The results indicated that at concentrations of 0.08-0.10mg/mL, milk-derived peptides could realize a damage prevention effect through inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation malondialdehyde (MDA). Also, these peptides were found to promote the photoaging related enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), while to block the production of matrix metalloproteinases-1. Through this study, we found that milk-derived peptide mixture is effective in preventing photoaging damage. Milk-derived peptides found in this study could serve as raw materials for future development of antioxidant functional foods.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Whey protein, as a nutrient-rich waste from dairy industry, several studies have investigated its bioconversion. This study aimed to convert whey protein into antifungal peptides by synergistic interactions with Lactobacillus paracasei and Propionibacterium freudenreichii. The response surface methodology was employed for optimization. The optimum fermentation medium contained 26.69 g/L lactose, 28.44 g/L nitrogen sources (soytone: whey protein = 2:1, m/m) and the inoculum size was at 3.72% (v/v). The fermentate was sensitive to proteolytic enzymes, strong alkaline (pH > 10.0) and high temperature. A total of 156 peptides were identified by nanoliter liquid phase-Q Exactive quadrupole ultra-high resolution orbitrap mass spectrometer (Nano LC-Q Exactive Plus) and screened by PEAKS X software. Finally, the decisive factors of antifungal function were determined by principal component analysis. The research provided experimental and theoretical support for the process optimization and mechanistic explanation of whey protein fermentation to produce antifungal substances.

Food Chemistry					Ascorbic acid (AsA) is generally used as an antibrowning agent for fresh-cut potato (FCP). However, its browning inhibitory effect is temporary because of its rapid consumption during redox processes. In this study, the effect of browning inhibition in FCP slices was evaluated using low frequency ultrasound (LFU; 40 kHz, 200 W, 3 min) and AsA (0.2%, w/v) treatments alone or in combination. The results showed that LFU combined with AsA (LFU-AsA) treatment could achieve a better antibrowning effect than either treatment alone (higher L*, lower a* and DeltaE*), and there was no adverse effect on texture properties. LFU-AsA treatment not only inhibited the activity of PPO more effectively than AsA treatment, but also enhanced the antibrowning effect by retaining higher AsA content. Moreover, it also maintained membrane integrity by limiting lipid peroxidation and solute migration during storage. Overall, LFU-AsA treatment would be a promising method in food preservation industries.

Foods					This study investigated the effects of resveratrol (RES) supplementation on the growth performance, carcass and meat quality, blood lipid levels and ruminal bacterial microbiota of fattening goats. A total of forty castrated Nubian goats (28.25 0.26kg body weight) were randomly divided into four groups and provided with diets containing different levels of RES (0, 150, 300 and 600mg/kg) for 120 d. The results showed that RES increased redness and intramuscular fat content, whilst reducing shear force in the longissimus dorsi muscle of goats (p< 0.05). In addition, the final weight, average daily gain, hot carcass weight, net meat weight, carcass lean percentage and eye muscle area of goats were significantly increased in the 150mg/kg RES group compared with the other three groups, while those in the 600mg/kg RES group significantly decreased (p< 0.05). RES significantly decreased serum triacylglycerol and LDL-C contents (p< 0.05), and increased HDL-C content and the HDL-C/TC ratio (p< 0.05). Supplementation with 150mg/kg RES also increased the proportion of Acetitomaculum and Moryella, genera comprising short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. The present study indicated that an appropriate supplemental level of RES could improve the growth performance, neat percentage, meat quality, ruminal microbiota and serum lipid levels of fattening goats. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Yujiao Cheng; Yaqing Wei; Min Zhang; Hua Wang							Effect of micro-perforated film packing on physicochemical quality and volatile profile of button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) during postharvest shelf-life.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The perishable characteristics of button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) decrease the physicochemical and change the flavor profile, affecting consumer purchase. In this study, button mushrooms were separately stored in the package with 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 perforations for 8 days at 10°C, and whether the micro-perforated film packing delayed button mushrooms the changes in physicochemical quality and volatile profile was investigated. The results showed that 0 perforation packages could maintain the weight and firmness of button mushrooms. Micro-perforated film packing was found effective to decrease the browning index of button mushrooms during shelf-life. In addition, mushrooms in micro-perforation film packing had a lower concentration of 3 off-flavor compounds (2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, and ethanol) and a higher concentration of 13mushroom characteristic flavor compounds than that in 0 perforation film when stored for 8 days. The 8 perforations groups had the most varieties of aroma impact compounds (odor active values, OAV ≥ 1), which contributed to the flavor profile of button mushrooms. It is concluded that film with 8 perforations could create an atmosphere condition to maintain the physiology quality and volatile profile of button mushrooms during shelf-life. Novelty impact statement. The firmness of the mushroom was maintained due to the ethanol and low oxygen. 2-Methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, and ethanol were the main off-flavor compounds. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16648					FSTA:2022-11-Jq15545
J		Yujiao Cheng; Guijie Li; Houjiu Wu; Guolu Liang; Hua Wang							Flavor deterioration of Mandarin juice during storage by MDGC-MS/O and GC-MS/PFPD.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Commercial mandarin juice often exhibits flavor deterioration during storage. The changes in volatile flavor profiles were investigated in mandarin juice stored under three different temperature conditions (4 °C, 25 °C, and 40 °C). The application of multidimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry (MDGC-MS/O) coupled with aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) identified 31 odorants in stored mandarin juice, including seven off-flavor contributing compounds: methanethiol (unpleasant, repulsive), dimethyl sulfide (sulfur, cabbage), methional (cooked potato), p-cymene (solventy), 4-vinylguaiacol (medicine), terpinen-4-ol (wood), and alpha-terpineol (floral, mint). 4-Vinylguaiacol was also identified in mandarin juice for the first time. In addition, 64 volatile compounds determined by GC-MS/pulsed flame photometric detector (GC-MS/PFPD) were classified as alcohols, terpenes, volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), aldehydes, esters, ketones, and phenols. Volatile compound differences were observed in mandarin juice under different storage conditions by heat-map generation and principal component analysis (PCA). The results revealed that high-temperature storage led to a rapid increase in the concentration of total alcohols and VSCs. Furthermore, the flavor deterioration markers alpha-terpineol and dimethyl sulfide were identified based on off-flavor contribution and variable importance in projection (VIP) (score >1) values in the PLS-DA model. These two compounds are valuable for marker-assisted flavor deterioration analysis in mandarin juice during storage.

J		Yujiao Hou; Nan Long; Boyu Jia; Xiaofang Liao; Minghan Yang; Lizhu Fu; Lidong Zhou; Ping Sheng; Weijun Kong							Development of a label-free electrochemical aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of ochratoxin A.		Food Control					The prevalent ochratoxin A (OTA) contamination in food has increased the urgency to develop sensitive and accurate detection methods. This study reported a conveniently fabricated label-free electrochemical (EC) aptasensor for ultrasensitive detection of OTA based on the competitive binding of OTA with its specific aptamer without any signal amplification strategy. A gold electrode (AuE) was modified with a compact layer of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), obtained via OTA aptamer and complementary DNA (cDNA) hybridization, to act as a barrier for redox probe [Fe(CN)6]3-/4- to AuE access. This led to a high initial electron-transfer resistance (Rct), recorded via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Since the aptamer displayed a higher affinity to OTA than cDNA, the added OTA triggered aptamer dissociation from AuE to form the OTA-aptamer complex, obviously decreasing the Rct. The target-induced variation in the resistance response strongly depended on the OTA concentration. Optimum conditions improved the linear relationship between Rct and the logarithm of OTA concentration in a range of 0.05-10 ng/mL with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.05 ng/mL for OTA. Recoveries of 74.8-105% with relative standard deviations (RSDs) of 8.86-13.09% were obtained in the spiked malt samples. The Real-world detection of OTA in the actual malt samples confirmed the reliability of the convenient, cost-effective, and highly specific impedimetric aptasensor, exhibiting significant promise for extended application in food control to identify more hazardous contaminants by altering the corresponding aptamers.

J		Yujiao Sun; Fan Wang; Yang Liu; Yuye An; Dawei Chang; Jiankang Wang; Fei Xia; Ning Liu; Xuefeng Chen; Yungang Cao							Comparison of water- and alkali-extracted polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea and their immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo.		Food & Function					In the present study, the purpose is to compare the effect of water extraction and alkali-assisted extraction on the structural characteristics and immunomodulatory activity of polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea (FBTPs). The results indicated that water-extracted FBTPs (W-FBTPs) and alkali-extracted FBTPs (A-FBTPs) had similar molecular weights but different monosaccharide compositions, of which A-FBTPs had a higher yield and uronic acid groups corresponding to galacturonic acid (GalA). Moreover, A-FBTPs had stronger ability to promote phagocytic capacity, acid phosphatase activity and nitric oxide (NO) secretion in macrophages in vitro. In the in vivo study, A-FBTPs exhibited a promising effect to adjust the immune imbalance by enhancing the body features, antioxidant activities, immune response and intestinal mucosal barrier in cytoxan (CTX)-induced immunosuppressive mice. Besides, A-FBTP supplementation effectively improved CTX-induced gut microbiota dysbiosis, including promoting the abundance of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Lactobacillus) and short chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g., Lachnospiraceae, Prevotellaceae and Ruminococcaceae), along with reducing the growth of potentially pathogenic microbes (e.g., Desulfovibrionaceae and Helicobacter). These findings suggested that alkaline extraction might be a promising way to obtain high-quality acidic polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT), and A-FBTPs could be developed as novel potential prebiotics and immunomodulators for further application in food formulations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	2	806	824	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02944d					FSTA:2022-05-Hn4335

Food Research International					The present study investigated the immune-protective effect of polysaccharides from Fuzhuan brick tea (FBTPs) in cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppressive mice. The results showed that high-dose of FBTPs administration remarkably alleviated Cy-evoked immune damage through improving the body features, organ indices, immune responses and oxidative stress in the mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that FBTPs obviously restored Cy-evoked microbial dysbiosis by increasing several beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus, Allobaculum, Unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae and norank_f_Lachnospiraceae, while reducing Bacteroides, norank_f_Ruminococcaceae, Colidextribacter, Alloprevotella, norank_f_Desulfovibrionaceae and Helicobacter. Meanwhile, metabolomics analysis found that FBTPs significantly altered a range of microbial metabolites, including inosine, deoxyinosine, taurine, sinapic acid, maltotriose, butyric acid, lysophosphatidyl cholines (LysoPCs), lysophosphatidic acids (LysoPAs) and choline. These altered metabolites were involved in purine metabolism, ABC transporters, sulfur metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, protein digestion and absorption, choline metabolism in cancer and glycerophospholipid metabolism pathways, which were mainly related to immune responses, antioxidant capacity and energy supply of the immunosuppressive mice. Additionally, some significant correlations were observed between the specific microbiota and effective metabolites. These results provide a novel insight into the immune-protective effect of FBTPs on regulating the intestinal microbiota and metabolism, which are helpful for thoroughly understanding the nutrition of FBTPs and providing a solid basis for the deeper utilization of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT).

Journal of Food Science					Total phenolic content (TPC), phenolic profiles, and antioxidant activity of free and bound extracts of Sargassum polycystum, obtained by different extraction solvents and hydrolysis methods, were investigated. Aqueous acetone afforded the highest free TPC and antioxidant ability, followed by aqueous ethanol and aqueous methanol. Twelve free phenolic compounds were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS), including two hydroxycinnamic acids, seven flavonoids, one stilbene, and two phlorotannins. Three to nine different free phenolic compounds were extracted by these solvents with different compositions, including nine by 70% acetone and eight by 70% methanol, 70% ethanol, and 50% ethanol. The highest total content of free phenolic compounds determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection was obtained from 70% ethanol. Alkaline hydrolysis afforded higher bound TPC (274.27 mg GAE/100 g DW) and antioxidant ability than acid hydrolysis. Five bound phenolic compounds were characterized by UHPLC-MS and five were released from alkaline hydrolysis, whereas two were released from acid hydrolysis. Total content of bound phenolic compounds released by alkaline hydrolysis was 14.68-fold higher than that by acid hydrolysis. The free and bound TPC, phenolic profiles, and antioxidant activities depended on the extraction solvent used. These results indicate that S. polycystum is a potentially useful antioxidant source and contribute to the development of seaweed-based functional foods. Practical Application. Phenolics are usually divided into free and bound forms based on their extractability and interaction with cell wall components. The nutritional effects of bound phenolics in algae have long been neglected. These topics contribute to the development of seaweed-based functional foods. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Bioscience					In this work, the medium internal phase O/W Pickering emulsions stabilized with bamboo shoots nanocellulose (BSNC) was successfully fabricated. The nanocellulose extracted from bamboo shoots with an average width of 56.37 nm and height of 7.44 nm showed great potential as an emulsifier in the Pickering emulsions. The effects of BSNC content, oil-water ratio and emulsification process on the structure, stability and rheology of the resultant Pickering emulsions was explored. The obtained emulsion with the BSNC content of 0.5 wt% at the oil to water volume ratio of 5:5 had a lower particle size of around 25 mum. With the increasing BSNC content, the emulsions presented increased droplet size, and even demulsification occurred. Interestingly, the physicochemical properties of the emulsions could be significantly improved through twice shearing, which effectively reduced droplet size. The surface coverage was above 100% for the Pickering emulsions stabilized with the BSNC content of 0.5%-1.1%. With the increasing BSNC content, the apparent viscosity was increased first and then decreased, and all emulsions showed elastic behaviors. This work would provide theoretical guidance for preparing medium or high internal phase Pickering emulsions stabilized with nanocellulose.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					Egg yolk antibody (IgY) is a superior functional antibody, which can be widely utilized in food, medical diagnosis, and daily chemical industry. Specific anti-Streptococcus mutans IgY can effectively prevent the occurrence of caries. It has the great potential to be used in active toothpaste against caries. However, the effect of surfactants used in toothpaste on the activity and structure of IgY should be evaluated. As ELISA methods revealed, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) generated a great loss of IgY activity compared to the impacts of cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAB). The thermal transition temperature of the CAB-IgY mixture was extended backwards, while SDS-IgY had basically no apparent endothermic peak illustrating the protein was denatured prior to heating. The conformation and secondary structure changes of IgY can also be observed from the blue shift of aromatic amino acid, fluorescence quench, and FTIR spectrum at presence of SDS. By contrast, CAB behaved no significant destruction on IgY and could be used as a great foaming agent in the antibody toothpaste.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Water-in-oil-in-water (W1/O/W2) emulsions stabilized by protein-carbohydrate complexes were prepared from an inner water phase (W1), an oil phase (O) and an outer water phase (W2). The complexes consisted of heat-induced aggregates (HIAs) of isomalto-oligosaccharide/egg white protein Maillard conjugates. The effects of polyglycerol ester of polyricinoleic acid (PGPR) concentration, HIA concentration, W1-to-O volume ratio and W1/O-to-W2 volume ratio on the properties of the W1/O/W2 emulsions were systematically investigated. Results. At sufficiently high PGPR concentrations (>2%), the emulsions possess a high negative charge (-44mV). The encapsulation efficiency of the emulsions, which was determined by incorporating a hydrophilic yellow dye in the inner water phase prior to homogenization, was relatively high (up to 93%) and did not change significantly during 14-day storage at 4°C. All emulsions were fluids that exhibited shear thinning behavior. Conclusion. Overall, this study shows that nature-derived emulsifiers can be used to create W1/O/W2 emulsions suitable for application in the food industry. In addition, we provided a viable strategy to encapsulate water-soluble nutrients. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	13	5795	5807	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11929					FSTA:2022-12-Ae24035

Food & Function					Hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) is the main bioactive component of safflower and has been reported to have significant health-promoting abilities. However, the regulation of HSYA on different types of skeletal myofibers is largely unknown. Here, in vitro experiments found that the water extract of safflower could significantly increase MyHC I, MB and Tnni1mRNA expression while downregulating MyHC IIb mRNA expression. Furthermore, HSYA triggered fast-to-slow fiber-type switching and increased gene expression related to mitochondrial biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Autodock analyses proved that FoxO1 is a potential target of HSYA, and qRT-PCR and western blotting further showed that HSYA significantly promoted the activation of the FoxO1 signaling pathway. Additionally, the levels of PGC1alpha, downstream of FoxO1, also significantly increased after HSYA treatment. Together, our findings suggested that HSYA triggered a fast-to-slow myofiber-type shift through the FoxO1 signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	11	6317	6328	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03612b					FSTA:2022-10-Jq13183

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The quality components in postharvest tea leaves determine their quality characteristics and processing suitability. Currently, chemical analysis is widely used to determine these indicators. However, this method is time-consuming and laborious. In this study, we developed a NIR-based analytical tool on a smartphone for in situ and rapid detection of quality indicators in postharvest tea leaves of multiple varieties and harvesting standards. The smartphone and the miniature NIR spectrometer are used for data acquisition and transfer to the phone via Bluetooth. Partial least squares (PLS) modeling coupled with spectral pre-processing and selection of characteristic wavelengths were used to obtain the optimal predictive model. The results showed that the quality of various tea tree varieties and harvesting standards differed considerably. The PLS models with suitable wavelengths achieved acceptable predictive performance for tea polyphenols, amino acids, and polyphenol to amino acid ratio (P/A values). The determination coefficients of the prediction set for tea polyphenols, amino acids, and the P/A value were 0.90, 0.91, and 0.91, and residual predictive deviations were 2.24, 2.43, and 2.42, respectively. Based on the optimal model constructed, a smartphone based analytical software was developed to achieve low-cost and rapid quality quantification of postharvest fresh tea leaves.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To solve the problem of apple powder strong hygroscopicity, wheat gluten was selected as a natural anticaking agent and added into apple powder in different proportions. The moisture absorption data of the samples was monitored in different relative humidity environments at 25 °C and 35 °C. The results showed that the addition of wheat gluten could reduce the equilibrium moisture content and the size and number of agglomerates of freeze-dried apple powder. The fitting parameters of the Guggenheim-Anderson-DeBoer and the low-field nuclear magnetic resonance results revealed that the existence of wheat gluten restricted the water migration, which was conducive to maintain a good particle state of powder. To sum up, the wheat gluten as an anticaking agent could not only have the effect of inhibiting moisture absorption during the storage of freeze-dried apple powder, but also possess the potential to be used in various fruit powder production.

Food Chemistry					Present study prepared curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes using bovine milk, krill phospholipids and cholesterol; and investigated the effects of cholesterol on membrane characteristics, storage stability and antibacterial properties of the curcumin nanoliposomes. Bovine milk phospholipids which have higher saturation than krill phospholipids resulted in formation of curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes with higher encapsulation efficiency (84.78%), larger absolute value of zeta potential and vesicle size (size: 159.15 5.27 nm, zeta potential:-28.3 0.62 mV). Cholesterol helps to formation of a more hydrophobic, compact and tighter bilayer membrane structure which improved the storage stability of nanoliposomes under alkaline (66.25 0.46%), heat (43.25 0.69%) and sunlight (49.44 1.78%) conditions. In addition, curcumin-loaded nanoliposomes can effectively target infectious bacteria which secrete pore-forming toxins such as Staphylococcus aureus by causing the bacterial cell wall to lysis. Findings from present work can guide future development of novel antibacterial agents for use in food preservation.

J		Yujie Zhang; Jinchuang Zhang; Qiongling Chen; Ning He; Qiang Wang							High-moisture extrusion of mixed proteins from soy and surimi: effect of protein gelling properties on the product quality.		Foods					The high-moisture extrusion of proteins from plant and animal sources should be a new way for developing alternative protein products with meat-like texture. The protein gelling properties are considered an important factor for the meat-like texture formation during the high-moisture extrusion processing. In this study, the mixed protein gelling properties from soy protein isolate (SPI) and surimi at different ratios (90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40 and 50:50) were investigated to relate to the high-moisture (70%) extruding product textural properties, correspondingly. Results showed that at SPI-surimi ratio 60:40, the heat-induced gelation time was clearly extended and the gel strength became much weaker. During the high-moisture extrusion processing, at SPI-surimi ratio 80:20, the extrudate showed the higher hardness, chewiness, gel strength and fibrous degree, while excessive surimi (more than 40%) in the blends would hinder the fibrous-oriented structure formation. It suggested that SPI may act as the continuous phase that is dispersed by surimi during the high-moisture extrusion processing. Interestingly, it was found that the gel strength of SPI-surimi blends was nonlinearly correlated with the specific mechanical energy (SME) and product textural properties. The study would be helpful for improving the textural properties of alternative protein products from soy and surimi. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Steam explosion (SE) can improve the degradation efficiency of macromolecules such as defatted soybean meal (DSM). In this study, the physicochemical properties and the fermentation characteristics of SE-pretreated DSM were investigated. As shown by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the dense structure of DSM was clearly cracked with larger voids. Under the pressure of 1.5 MPa, cellulose and hemicellulose were degraded by 50.7% and 71.1% respectively. When DSM treated with different SE pressure was applied to the soy sauce fermentation process, the content of amino acid nitrogen was increased 2-folds higher compared to the control, and the fermentation time has been greatly reduced. Simultaneously, the alcohols content of SS-1.5 sample was more than three times that of the control, particularly in the production of higher alcohols such as 2-methyl-1-butanol. The aldehydes, which contribute to the fruity and smoky-like aroma of soy sauce, increased significantly in both content and types (e.g., decanal, isobutyraldehyde, and 2-methylbutyraldehyde). The typical umami flavor and sauce-like aroma of soy sauce were considerably improved after SE-pretreated DSM. Taken together, SE pretreatment improved the utilization rate of raw materials and the quality of soy sauce flavor.

Food & Function					Dioscin is a steroidal saponin isolated from various kinds of vegetables and herbs and possesses various biological activities. In this study, the protective effect of dioscin on diabetic nephropathy (DN) was explored. Dioscin and metformin (positive control) were administered orally to diabetic rats daily for 8 weeks. The biochemistry parameters, pancreas and kidney histological changes, oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, autophagy, and mitochondrial quality and quantity control (mitophagy and mitochondrial fission/fusion) were measured. Our results showed that dioscin effectively reduced blood glucose, pancreatic injury, renal function markers and renal pathological changes in DN rat kidneys. Dioscin reduced O2- and H2O2 levels, decreased MDA levels, enhanced antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT) activities, and reduced inflammatory factor expressions. Moreover, NOX4 expression and the disorder of the mitochondrial respiratory chain were reversed by dioscin. Furthermore, apoptosis mediated by the mitochondria and ER stress was inhibited by dioscin through downregulating the expressions of Bax, CytC, Apaf-1, caspase 9, p-PERK, p-EIF2alpha, IRE1, p-IRE1, XBP1s, ATF4, p-CHOP and caspase 12. In addition, autophagy was enhanced by dioscin via an AMPK-mTOR pathway. Mitophagy and mitochondrial fission/fusion belong to the mitochondrial quality and quantity control process, which was improved by dioscin via regulating Parkin, PINK1, DRP1, p-DRP1 and MFN2 expressions. Collectively, these results suggested that dioscin protected against DN through inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis mediated by the mitochondria and ER stress. Autophagy and mitochondrial quality and quantity control (mitophagy and mitochondrial fission/fusion) were also improved by dioscin. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	6	3660	3673	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02733f					FSTA:2022-07-Aj11363
J		Yujihn Kwon; Yongui Gu; Yoonhwa Jeong							Evaluation of pyrrolizidine alkaloids in Korean commercial honeys and bee pollens.		Food Science and Technology Research					Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in 200 honeys and 63 bee pollens distributed in South Korea were investigated to evaluate their concentration and safety by simultaneous LC-MS/MS analysis. The risk of PAs' intake was also evaluated. The average PA concentration in honey and bee pollen was lower in products produced in South Korea (honey, 4.2 g/kg; bee pollen, 306.4 g/kg) than in ones produced outside South Korea (honey, 24.3 g/kg; bee pollen, 327.5 g/kg). PA concentration in bee pollen was about 30 times higher than in honey. It was thought that bee pollen had a significant effect on PA concentration in honey, as honey and bee pollen showed similar PA detection tendencies. The daily exposure to PAs from honey intake was 0.0003 g/kg body weight (b.w.) per day for all ages, and the safe margin of exposure (MOE) calculated based on BMDL10 237 g/kg b.w./day was 722 759, which was a safe level (MOE 10000 or more).										2022	28	2	123	132	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.FSTR-D-21-00221					FSTA:2023-01-Lg0083

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Roasting is the primary link in Chinese traditional whole oat food processing, but the role of roasting is rarely explored. This study aimed to clarify the effects of roasting treatment (160°C, 0-60 min) of oat kernels on the characteristics of oat flour from the aspects of micromorphology, constituents, gelation, structure, and starch digestibility. Results showed roasting treatment disrupted the structure of oat kernels, promoted the release of lipids, and caused the aggregation and wrapping of oat flour particles. After roasting treatment, starch and protein content of whole oat flour did not change significantly, but lipid content increased and beta-glucan content decreased. The roasted samples had better water absorption (25°C, 2.41-2.69 g/g), swelling power (25°C, 2.44-2.78), and solubility (100°C, 25.40-28.11%), lower pasting viscosity (final viscosity, 1.84-3.61 Pa s), higher gel strength, and lower short-range order. Pasting viscosities and gel properties with roasting time conformed to the second-order polynomial model. Oat flour from roasting oat kernels for 40 min had the highest crystallinity (19.74%), the highest digestibility rate constant (k, 0.07), and lower product concentration (C, 77.74%). These results will contribute to the application of roasting technology in the modification of whole oats.

J		Yujuan Gu; Xiaojie Qian; Binghua Sun; Sen Ma; Xiaoling Tian; Xiaoxi Wang							Nutritional composition and physicochemical properties of oat flour sieving fractions with different particle size.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Nutritional constituents, hydration, pasting, and thermal properties of oat flour sieve fractions (74-180 mum) and the relationship between composition and characteristics were studied. Starch constituents, protein components (except for albumins), and saturated fatty acids (SFA) were mostly distributed in small particle fractions, while total protein, albumin, dietary fiber (DF), lipids, and unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) were abundant in large particle fractions. Amino acids (except for Tyr and Gly) of group , II, and III were significantly lacking in S2 (150-180 mum), and Cys decreased from 2.51% to 1.50% with the decrease in sieving particle sizes. The largest particles showed the highest water solubility index (WSI, 9.90%), the medium particles (100-132 mum) exhibited the highest pasting viscosities (final viscosity of 4148 cP), and the smallest particles had the maximum gelatinization enthalpy (DeltaH, 3.2 J/g). Correlation analysis demonstrated that except for the basic components, Glu, Cys, Iso, Phe, C16:0, C18:0, and C18:2n6c also significantly affected the WSI and pasting properties of oat flour, while amylose, Gly, Ala, Val, Met, and C20:1 were highly correlated with thermal properties. The results are useful for oat processing and the development of oat-based products with specific particle size range to achieve desirable characteristics.

Journal of Functional Foods					The previous study has established that brusatol exhibits growth inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effects. However, whether brusatol can suppress the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells remains unclear. Information in The Cancer Genome Atlas database indicates that NRF2 expression is tightly associated with the status of lymphatic metastasis and overall survival. Gene set enrichment analysis has also revealed that the JAK-STAT pathway could be suppressed by brusatol and is significantly enriched for phenotypes associated with high expression of the NRF2 gene. Therefore, we speculated and confirmed that brusatol can inhibit cell invasion and migration via the NRF2 pathway. Additionally, low NRF2 gene expression results in a function similar to that of brusatol as well as decreased expression of NF-kappaB and p-STAT3. Furthermore, brusatol reversed gemcitabine-induced overexpression of NF-kappaB and p-STAT3. Together, our results suggest that brusatol can inhibit the invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cells through NRF2/NF-kappaB/STAT3 signaling cascade.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Yibin Yacai is one of the most popular pickled vegetables in Sichuan made from special local stem mustard via spontaneous fermentation. The final quality of the Yibin Yacai product depends on every manufacturing process that affects the microbial communities during fermentation. In this study, the effects of brown sugar addition and fermentation time on physicochemical quality, flavor, and microbial communities of Yibin Yacai under five different fermentation conditions were investigated. The brown sugar addition can effectively increase the activities of microorganisms such as Lactobacillus and Debaryomyces, resulting in an increase in lactic acid content, sweet amino acids and umami amino acids. Furthermore, fermentation time plays a critical role in determining their physicochemical quality and flavor. The Yibin Yacai samples fermented for 5 years present the highest content of reducing sugar, amino acid nitrogen, esters, aldehydes, and olefins, while having the lowest salinity. These results indicate that the brown sugar addition and fermentation time could significantly influence the physicochemical and flavor qualities of the Yibin Yacai by tuning microbial communities during fermentation. These findings reveal the importance of controlling manufacturing processes for traditionally fermented Yibin Yacai and provide a new perspective on the technological innovation of fermented Yibin Yacai.

J		Yuksel, A.; Atalay, D.; Erge, H. S.							The effects of chitosan coating and vacuum packaging on quality of fresh-cut pumpkin slices during storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The quality of fresh-cut products can be improved by edible coatings and packaging. In this study, fresh-cut pumpkin slices, coated with chitosan and vacuum-packed, were stored at 4 and 10 °C for 21 days. The effects of chitosan and vacuum packaging on color, microbiological load, and beta-carotene content of samples were performed during storage. Texture analyses were conducted only on the first and last days of the period. Microbial counts of coated and vacuum-packed samples were restricted as compared to untreated samples. At both storage temperatures, beta-carotene content and a* value of all samples increased while L*, b*, C*, and h° values decreased. Changes in beta-carotene and color values (a*, b*, C*, and h°) were fitted to zero-order kinetics. The highest textural parameters were determined in coated and vacuum-packed samples. Both coated and vacuum-packed pumpkin slices stored at 4 °C can be recommended especially for textural and microbiological quality. Novelty impact statement. In this study, coated and vacuum-packed fresh-cut pumpkin slices with potential marketability, have been pointed out. It is noticed that chitosan coating combined with vacuum packaging provides a good preservation for fresh-cut pumpkin slices stored at low temperature. Chitosan can be proposed as an antimicrobial agent due to lower microbiological criteria in chitosan-treated pumpkin slices and vacuum packaging can be suggested a good barrier for keeping the color of the samples stored at low temperature. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16365					FSTA:2022-07-Jq9049
J		Yuksel, F.; Kayacier, A.							Effects of addition of stale bread flour on the acrylamide, fatty acid composition, resistant starch content, and in vitro glycemic index in wheat chips production using response surface methodology.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the world, breads were wasted by consumers due to staling and the aim of the study is to develop a new snack food by fortification of wheat chips with stale bread flour (SBF). The effect of process variables on some chemical properties and fatty acid of the chips were investigated by response surface methodology. The coefficient of determination (R2) of the response models ranged from 0.61 to 0.92, revealing that the models adequately explained the variability in the responses. The acrylamide of the enriched chips increased with both increasing frying temperature and SBF content. The addition of SBF into the chips dough increased the contents of protein (by 13%) and resistant starch (by 58%) of the end products. The maximum GI content was determined as 88.94, while the minimum GI content was 80.59 and the addition of SBF decreased the GI of the chips by 10% although this decrease was not statistically significant. According to the optimization parameters, the best chips were those containing 50% SBF, fried at 183 °C for 40 s. It was concluded that the SBF could be added to the formulation of wheat chips to offer an alternative snack for consumers.

Food Chemistry					In this study, for the first time, surface molecularly imprinted magnetic covalent organic frameworks (Fe3O4@COFs@MIPs) were combined with disposable screen-printed electrode (SPE) to construct a portable and on-site electrochemical sensor for the rapid detection of tetracycline (TC). The Fe3O4@COFs@MIPs, which was prepared by layer-by-layer modification method, had good magnetism and excellent adsorption ability. With the help of disposable SPE, equipped with a magnet, the electrode modification process was simplified and the detection efficiency was improved. Under optimal conditions, the fabricated electrochemical sensor exhibited linearity ranging from 1 * 10-10 to 1 * 10-4 g mL-1. It had good selectivity, excellent reproducibility, desirable stability and remarkable applicability. The fabricated sensor was successfully applied to detect TC in real samples with satisfactory recoveries (96.15-106.20%).

Food Chemistry					A novel label-free point-of-care quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) aptasensing platform based on metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was fabricated for tetracycline (TC) detection. MOFs (HKUST-1) and AuNPs were modified onto the sensing interface of QCM sensor to enhance the sensing performance of the QCM aptasensor. TC aptamer with sulfhydryl group was fixed through Au-S bond. The recognition performance of the aptasensor was predicted and verified by the computer simulation. At the optimal conditions, the frequency change of the sensor was adopted for quantitative detection of TC. The prepared QCM aptasensor exhibited a wide linear range from 1 * 10-10 g mL-1 to 1 * 10-5 g mL-1 with low limit of detection (0.8 * 10-11 g mL-1). High sensitivity, good selectivity, acceptable recoveries (87.6-91.4%) in real samples were obtained.

Journal of Functional Foods					Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by chronic relapsing and persistent inflammation that mainly affects the colon. The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of Agaricus blazei Murrill polysaccharides (ABP) or selenium-enriched Agaricus blazei Murrill polysaccharides (ABP-Se) on UC. UC mouse model was established by 2.5% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Markers for colonic barrier functions, cytokines and oxidative stress were measured. The experimental results showed that ABP and ABP-Se significantly alleviated UC-related symptoms, including weight loss, colon shorten, and disease activity index scores. Meanwhile, ABP and ABP-Se significantly promoted tight junction proteins and mucus content, and decreased inflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, ABP-Se exhibited a better anti-oxidative ability compared to ABP. The experimental results suggest that ABP and ABP-Se relieve DSS-induced colitis via reducing inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, and preventing colonic barrier damage. This study suggests a promising therapeutic effect of mushrooms-derived polysaccharides on UC.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The agricultural production system is facing increasing demand pressure and environmental pressure. Green and efficient production methods are urgently needed in order to further enhance the yield of winter wheat and reduce the negative impact on the environment. Here, we analyzed the potential yield and yield gap of winter wheat in Shandong Province of China from 1981 to 2009. Meanwhile, we specified the effects of sowing time, irrigation and fertilization scheme, and variety characteristics on winter wheat. Results. In the past 29years, the yield gap in most areas of Shandong has become smaller, because the actual yield has increased and the potential yield has changed little under the background of climate change. In addition, it is found that delaying sowing date is beneficial to increase yield by helping winter wheat avoid adverse climate conditions. Also, an irrigation amount of 240mm and nitrogen application amount of 180-210kgha-1 are best to maintain high yield, high resource utilization rate and low environmental pollution in this area. These suggested levels are lower than those currently used by many local farmers. Wheat varieties with longer grain-filling period and photoperiod response, higher grain-filling rate and grain weight were more adaptable to climate change. Conclusion. Improving agronomic management measures can significantly increase the yield of winter wheat and narrow the yield gap. This study can provide valuable information for improving the production potential of winter wheat, and for reducing the damage of agricultural activities to the environment. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	10	4238	4249	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11775					FSTA:2022-10-Mj5920

International Food Research Journal					Gingerol and shogaol are two bioactive compounds of ginger which exhibit several positive effects on human health. The conventional method for shogaol preparation is considered ineffective because it causes losses to the environmental system, and the efficiency of the process is low. Reactive extraction with subcritical water is a method that is considered environmentally friendly for the separation of slightly polar components without using organic solvents. The advantage of the reactive extraction process with subcritical water is that it does not require a catalyst because the process is able to form hydronium ions which can act as a catalyst to convert shogaol into gingerol. The effect of time and temperature on the yields of subcritical water reactive extraction of gingerol and shogaol were investigated in the present work. Experiments were carried out at a fixed pressure of 2 bar, and a varied temperature of reactive extraction from 130 to 140°C. Ginger and shogaol contents were analysed from the samples every 10 min. The chemical profiling of the resulting ginger extracts was performed using HPLC-MS. Results showed that the best subcritical water process was at 2 bar, 130°C, and 20 min; shogaol concentration increased to 15.345%, and gingerol to 5.113%. For the reactive extraction time of longer than 20 min, the shogaol concentration of the extract decreased. When temperature was above 120°C, and water hydrogen bonds weakened, thus resulting in high amounts of ionisation products of subcritical water.										2022	29	4	857	863	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.4.12					FSTA:2023-01-Te0203
J		Yulin Feng; Xuejia Feng; Shuchang Liu; Huijuan Zhang; Jing Wang							Interaction mechanism between cereal phenolic acids and gluten protein: protein structural changes and binding mode.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Phenolic acids are antioxidant nutrients in cereals and affect the quality of wheat products and the properties of gluten protein. Gallic acid (GA), caffeic acid (CA), syringic acid (SA), and p-coumaric acid (p-CA) were selected to study the interaction mechanism between cereal phenolic acids and gluten protein. Results. The results showed that adding GA significantly (P<0.05) decreased the content of free sulfhydryl in gluten proteins by 70-87.26% compared with the control group. The aggregates' behavior of gluten protein induced by adding the phenolic acids would produce oversized particles (>5000nm). Adding the selected phenolic acids changed the hydrogen-bond linkage of protein secondary structure. Zeta potential values of gluten protein increased significantly (P<0.05) by 14.41%, 26.49%, 30.77%, and 57.93% for CA, p-CA, GA, and SA respectively added at 0.03gkg-1. Moreover, the gluten protein surface hydrophobicity increased when the phenolic acids were added at 0.03gkg-1, displaying the effect of the phenolic acid on the hydrophobic interaction of protein. Molecular docking results showed that the selected phenolic acids could interact with glutenin and gliadin using hydrogen-bond formation, and SA had the strongest binding with glutenin and gliadin. Conclusion. The results demonstrated that the selected phenolic acids could interact with gluten protein via covalent cross-linking as well as by hydrogen bonding, thereby changing the structure of the gluten protein. This exploration is expected to provide theoretical support for the development and utilization of whole-grain foods. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	15	7387	7396	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12107					FSTA:2023-02-Mq1344
J		Yulin Feng; Xuejia Feng; Shuchang Liu; Huijuan Zhang; Jing Wang							Effects of dietary fiber and ferulic acid on dough characteristics and glutenin macropolymer (GMP) aggregation behavior during dough resting.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Dietary fiber (DF), ferulic acid (FA) and DF + FA were added to wheat flour to explore their effects on dough characteristics and glutenin macropolymer (GMP) aggregation behavior during dough resting. In the dough system with DF or FA, results indicated a significant correlation between the elasticity/cohesiveness of dough and GMP content (p< 0.05). The GMP content and disulfide bond content reduced significantly if DF or/and FA was added when the dough was rested for 60 min (R60) (p< 0.05). The significant positive correlation between GMP content and disulfide bond content (p< 0.05) demonstrated that adding of DF or/and FA affected the GMP polymerization process during dough resting. Compared with the Flour group (R60), the surface hydrophobicity of the DF group (R60) increased by 34.3% and the FA group (R60) decreased by 9.8%, while the DF + FA group (R60) and the Flour group (H0 = 2055) had a similar surface hydrophobicity (H0 = 2030), showing that the influence of FA- or DF-generated hydrophobic and stereo structures decreased. The results indicate that the combined effects of DF and FA reduced the degree of change induced by DF or FA alone on dough texture and GMP molecular aggregation, and the dynamic change trend seems more similar to that of the Flour groups.

J		Yuling Ma; Sumei Zhou; Jing Lu							Metabolomic analysis reveals changes of bioactive compounds in mung beans (Vigna radiata) during gamma-aminobutyric acid enrichment treatment.		Foods					Soaking together with Heat and Relative Humidity (HRH) treatment has been applied successfully to enrich gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in mung beans. However, whether and how the above GABA enrichment processing influences the other bioactive molecules is elusive. In the present study, mung beans were soaked and then treated by HRH for 5 or 7 h. By using metabolomics techniques, the changes of 496 metabolites were determined. The relative content of flavonoids and phenolic acids increased during soaking but slightly decreased during HRH. Intriguingly, soaking and HRH had the opposite effects on the glycosylation of polyphenols. The relative content of glycosylated or un-glycosylated polyphenols increased during soaking or HRH, respectively. The relative content of alpha-ketoglutaric acid increased more than 20 times after 5 h HRH treatment. Bioactive molecules could be enriched during GABA enrichment processing. Depending on the desired bioactive compounds, soaking and different duration of HRH treatment could be selected. © 2022 by the authors.

Effect of heat and relative humidity treatment on gamma-aminobutyric acid accumulation, other micronutrients contents, antioxidant activities and physicochemical properties of mung bean (Vigna radiata L.).		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					A novel approach to heat and relative humidity (HRH, 65-75 °C, 98% RH) treatment was used to enhance gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) of mung bean with a low moisture (12-20%) within several hours (4-6h). Meanwhile, the changes in micronutrients, antioxidant activities and physicochemical properties were also evaluated. Results showed that the GABA content was significantly accumulated, increasing from 1.73 to 109.78mg100g-1 dry weight (DW) under the conditions of 16.72% moisture, 68.97 °C, 98% RH for 5.34h. Meanwhile, the amino acids, including aromatic (tyrosine and phenylalanine), sulphur-containing (methionine and cystine) and branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine), were significantly increased (P<0.05). Although HRH treatment decreased the total anthocyanin content of mung bean, the total phenolic, vitexin and isovitexin contents, and antioxidant activities were significantly increased (P<0.05). Furthermore, HRH treatment caused the wrinkled structure of mung bean coat, increased the paste viscosity of mung bean flour and decreased the time of complete gelatinisation of starch in mung bean by one third during cooking. These results suggested that HRH treatment could effectively elevate the above functional components, especially GABA, improve the antioxidant activities, pasting and cooking properties of mung bean. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	1	590	600	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15455					FSTA:2022-04-Jp4236

Influences of cooking and storage on gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and distribution in mung bean and its noodle products.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and distribution of mung bean (MB), heat and relative humidity treated MB (HRH-MB) under different cooking and storage conditions were investigated. The quality characteristics of noodles prepared by MB and HRH-MB were evaluated. Results showed that black MB varieties presented a higher average GABA content under HRH treatment than that of green MB varieties. Soaking significantly increased the GABA content of MB (P < 0.05), but, 58.78% of GABA in HRH-MB were distributed in the soaking solution. After cooking, although the GABA of HRH-MB had a slightly degradation, its content was higher than MB. With the increase of storage time, the GABA content in MB increased initially, followed by a decrease, whereas a slower reduction was observed on HRH-MB. Besides, compared with the mixed MB-wheat flour and noodles, the pasting properties of mixed HRH-MB-wheat flour, the color and texture properties of mixed HRH-MB-wheat noodles were improved and closer to wheat flour and noodles, respectively. Furthermore, the mixed HRH-MB-wheat noodles exhibited the highest GABA content (16.56 mg/100 g DW) after cooking. Therefore, HRH-MB may be an ideal material for enhancing GABA and improving the quality characteristic of MB-based foods.

Meat Science					This study investigated the effect of dietary alpha-lipoic acid (600 mg/kg) supplementation on the postmortem color stability of the biceps femoris from lambs. The results showed that dietary alpha-lipoic acid supplementation increased a* and decreased b* and metmyoglobin (MMb) percentage of the biceps femoris with the time of storage (P< 0.05). The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) reduced with the time of storage after treatment with alpha-lipoic acid (P< 0.05). alpha-lipoic acid increased the myoglobin (Mb) content, and myosin heavy chain I (MyHC I) gene expression but decreased glycogen content, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and MyHC IIb gene expression (P< 0.05). The T-AOC value, catalase (CAT) activity, and expression of SOD and CAT gene expression increased after alpha-lipoic acid treatment (P< 0.05). Therefore, dietary alpha-lipoic acid supplementation improved the meat color by regulating muscle fiber types and inhibited glycolysis. Moreover, alpha-lipoic acid maintained meat color stability by effectively inhibiting muscle oxidation via enhancing the antioxidant capacity All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	193				0309-1740				10.1016/j.meatsci.2022.108945					FSTA:2023-01-Sl0132
J		Yulong Wei; Ning Yu; Ziyuan Wang; Yiming Hao; Zongwei Wang; Zihui Yang; Jie Liu; Jing Wang							Analysis of the multi-physiological and functional mechanism of wheat alkylresorcinols based on reverse molecular docking and network pharmacology.		Food & Function					Alkylresorcinols (ARs) are phenolic lipids present in the bran part of whole grain wheat and rye, which possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer and anti-tumor properties. The physiological activities of ARs have been proven to be diverse; however, the specific molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, reverse virtual screening and network pharmacology were used to explore the potential molecular mechanisms of the physiological function of ARs and their endogenous metabolites. The Metascape database was used for GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis. Furthermore, molecular docking was used to investigate the interactions between active compounds and potential targets. The results showed that the bioavailability of most ARs and their endogenous metabolites was 0.55 and 0.56, while the bioavailability of certain endogenous metabolites was only 0.11. Multiplex analysis was used to screen 73 important targets and 4 core targets (namely, HSP90AA1, EP300, HSP90AB1 and ERBB2) out of the 163 initial targets. The important targets involved in the key KEGG pathway were pathways in cancer (hsa05200), lipid and atherosclerosis (hsa05417), Th17 cell differentiation (hsa04659), chemical carcinogenesis-receptor activation (hsa05207), and prostate cancer (hsa05215). The compounds involved in the core targets were AR-C21, AR-C19, AR-C17,3,5-DHPHTA-S, 3,5-DHPHTA-G, 3,5-DHPPTA, 3,5-DHPPTA-S, 3,5-DHPPTA-G, 3,5-DHPPTA-Gly and 3,5-DHPPA-G. The interaction force between them was mainly related to hydrogen bonds and van der Waals. Overall, the physiological activities of ARs are not only related to their multiple targets, but may also be related to the synergistic effect of their endogenous metabolites. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	17	9091	9107	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01438f					FSTA:2022-12-Mj7206

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Catechol oxidase (CO) is one of the enzymes that cause browning of blueberries and related products. In-depth study of its properties will help reduce the loss caused by it. The optimal pH for catechol (CAT), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), 4-methylcatechol (4-MeCAT), 3-hydroxytyramine hydrochloride (3-HTH), and pyrogallol (PG) substrates were 6.0, 4.0, 3.0, 6.5, and 4.5, respectively. The substrates with catechol structure selected in the experiment can react with CO, except protocatechuic acid (PCA). Caffeic acid (CA) may be the most suitable natural substrate for this blueberry CO. The K+ and Na+ have little effect on the CO activity. Li+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ could increase enzyme activity at low concentrations (0-5 mmol/L). The most effective inhibitor in the experiment was tropolone (TPL; IC50=10.010.11 mumol/L), followed by 1,4-benzoquinone (1,4-BQ; IC50=34.840.56 mumol/L). It was found that the carboxyl or phenolic hydroxyl groups in the substrates and inhibitors played an important role in binding to the catalytic cavity. The position of THR320 (HB1+1) was a key in regulating enzyme activity. The sugars should be in high concentration condition to inhibit enzyme activity.

Food Chemistry					In this paper, we propose a facile program of preparing nanoscale gamma-cyclodextrin-based metal-organic frameworks (Nano-CD-MOFs) for the encapsulation of curcumin. Such Nano-CD-MOFs not only possess excellent mono-dispersity and crystalline structure, but also perform superior loading capacity. The results of N2 adsorption-desorption, XRD, DSC, and microtopography are utilized to confirm the presence status of encapsulated curcumin and further reveal the encapsulation mechanism of Nano-CD-MOFs. Curcumin-loaded Nano-CD-MOFs (Cur-Nano-CD-MOFs) dramatically increase curcumin solubility and a top-down uniform dispersion in the dissolution process. The perfect fitting of First-order and Korsmeyer-Peppas models suggests that the release performance of Nano-CD-MOFs is controlled by the loaded quantity of curcumin and related to Fickian diffusion. Moreover, the antioxidative stability of Cur-Nano-CD-MOFs is considerably enhanced even after 120min of persistent ultraviolet irradiation. Therefore, we suggest that such Nano-CD-MOFs can be promoted as an advanced carrier for the delivery of curcumin or other nutraceuticals.

Food Research International					This project explored the antibacterial mechanism of didecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB) toward Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and its removal effect on biofilms. Furthermore, we explored the effect of treatment by DDAB combined with slightly acidic electrolyzed water (SAEW) on biofilms of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa. First, DDAB has bacteriostatic and biofilm removal effects. Second, The effect of DDAB combined with SAEW on biofilm is more obvious than that of the two alone. DDAB at a concentration of 16 MIC combined with SAEW (ACC 30mg/L, ORP 875mV, pH 6.30) completely cleared the biofilm. In addition, the results of Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and Attenuated total reflection-Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) showed that DDAB combined with SAEW could disrupt the structure of biofilms, reduce polysaccharides, proteins and phospholipids in biofilms. This method has the potential to be used in food production chains to control S. aureus and P. aeruginosa and their biofilms, and it can be used in other industries.

Food Chemistry					Knowing the mechanism of action of sweet taste receptors is important for the design of new, healthy sweeteners. However, little is known about the structures and recognition mechanisms of these receptors. 28 sweeteners were assessed by molecular docking, and 8 typical sweeteners were chosen to construct sweetener-T1R2-membrane systems to analyze interactions between receptor and sweeteners. Natural sweeteners with low-intensity sweetness, such as fructose and xylitol, were released from the Venus flytrap domain at ~30 ns, with displacements greater than 50 A. In contrast, artificial neotame and advantame bound stably to the receptor, within 5 Angstrom. Van der Waals interactions were significant in high-intensity sweetener systems, imparting an energy difference of over 15 kcal/mol between neotame (artificial sweetener) and fructose (natural). These results provide a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of sweetener function and offer a new direction for the design of sweeteners.

Food Chemistry					The fragmentation pathway of H2PO2- in MS was obtained by Orbitrap HRMS and the reverse confirmation was carried out by the neutral loss detection experiment. The results showed that H2PO2- with even electron ion would produce the neutral loss of 2H and form a new even electron ion with a pair of lone-pair electrons. Based on this, a LC-MS/MS method was developed for the determination of H2PO2- in flour and flour products. The H2PO2- was separated on an Acclaim Trinity P1 composite ion exchange column, and then detected by MS/MS under MRM mode. Finally, the developed method was validated in terms of the linearity, selectivity, accuracy, precision and matrix effect. The method showed a good linearity (R2>0.999) in the concentration range of 50 ~ 1500 mug/L. The LOD and LOQ for H2PO2- were 10.0 mg/kg and 30.0 mg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries and RSDs (n=6) were 93.0%~102.9% and 2.6 ~ 5.6%, respectively.

J		Yumei Tang; An Ping Li; Jianping Xiao; Dongyang Li; Le Wang							Construction of catechin and bamboo shoot dietary fiber compounds: their protection and release of catechin during digestion.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The composite particles of the release and protective effect of catechin by embedding bamboo shoots dietary fibers-catechin (BC) with xanthan gum (GX), sodium alginate (SA), and pectin (Pec) were compared in vitro. SEM, FTIR, and TGA results suggested that the surface pores and cracks of the composite particles of GX-BC, SA-BC, and Pec-BC were reduced compared to BC, but there was no change in the structure and thermal stability. Moreover, the release amounts of catechin of BC, GX-BC, SA-BC, and Pec-BC after gastric digestion were 56.28%, 27.83%, 30.99%, and 35.40%, respectively, while the release amounts of catechin after intestinal digestion were 20.26%, 10.12%, 10.01%, and 12.14%, respectively. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and antioxidant activity of the composite particles were directly proportional to the release of catechin. Therefore, encapsulating BC with soluble polysaccharides could delay the release of catechin and retain more catechin to enter the colon. Practical applications. Catechins are easily affected by gastric acid and various enzymes in vivo, which reduce their bioavailability. The enzymatically prepared bamboo shoots dietary fibers to adsorb catechin and then embedding the compound of bamboo shoots dietary fibers and catechin by soluble polysaccharides to form new composite particles, and to study the function of dietary fibers in the release and protection of catechins during digestion. In the simulated digestion process in vitro, the embedding of soluble polysaccharides could remarkably reduce the release of catechins and increase the retention percentage of catechins, and it is possible to retain more catechins to enter the colon for release, thereby exerting greater physiological effects. We believed that our findings could be to provide basis for the development of new functional foods. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16703					FSTA:2022-11-Jq15550

Food & Function					Enteromorpha prolifera polysaccharide-zinc (EP-Zn), a kind of polysaccharide-zinc complex, has been shown to improve the immune response and reduce the inflammatory factors in weaned piglets. Yet, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. The present study was conducted to investigate the immunomodulating activity and anti-inflammatory mechanism of EP-Zn in mice. Different doses (350 mg kg-1, 700 mg kg-1, 1050 mg kg-1 and 1400 mg kg-1) of EP-Zn were administered to C57BL/6J mice for 28 days. The results showed that under physiological conditions, 350 mg kg-1 EP-Zn stimulated cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10) secrection, regulated the intestinal microbiota, and reduced the levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) (acetic acid and propionic acid). In addition, in the LPS-induced inflammation model, EP-Zn pretreatment effectively alleviated LPS-induced shortening of colonic length and increased MPO and DAO contents, improved intestinal physical barrier function by modulating mucosal structure, and attenuated intestinal inflammation via inhibiting the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. These findings suggested that EP-Zn exerted immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory activities under physiological and inflammatory conditions, respectively. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	1	52	63	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02171k					FSTA:2022-04-Rg1496

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					N,N-dimethylformamide is frequently present in industrial wastewater and is environmentally detrimental. The current study aims to assess the utilization and biodegradation of N, N-dimethylformamide-containing wastewater to lessen the associated environmental load. Results show that addition of wastewater containing N,N-dimethylformamide to Trichoderma reesei fermentation media enhances cellulase production and facilitates cellulose hydrolysis. However, N,N-dimethylformamide is a cellulase enhancer that is not degraded during cellulase production in T. reesei fermentation and is retained in the N, N-dimethylformamide-enhanced cellulase solution. Indeed, the cellulosic sugar solution generated via lignocellulose hydrolysis with N,N-dimethylformamide-enhanced cellulase retains N,N-dimethylformamide. We further identified three core enzyme modules-N,N-dimethylformamidase, dimethylamine dehydrogenase, and methylamine dehydrogenase enzyme-which were inserted into Escherichia coli to develop metabolically engineered strains. These strains degraded N,N-dimethylformamide and produced succinate using N,N-dimethylformamide-enhanced cellulosic sugar as the substrate. The platform described here can be applied to effectively convert waste into valuable bioproducts.										2022	70	42	13574	13582	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c05240					FSTA:2023-03-Ba0491

Food Bioscience					Mulberry (Mori Fructus), a highly promising functional food, has long exhibited multiple therapeutic effects as a tonic in traditional Chinese food and pharmacology. Polysaccharides have been regarded as the pivotal pharmacological ingredient in mulberry. In this study, structural characterization and bioactivities of polysaccharides from mulberry (PFM-3) were determined. The results showed that PFM-3 was a pyranose containing carboxyl group, which was mainly composed of glucose (Glc) and a small amount of mannose (Man) and fucose (Fuc). The molecular weight of PFM-3 was 96.17 kDa, and the surface of PFM-3 was compact and uniform crack. PFM-3 markedly decreased lipid accumulation, triglyceride (TG) and low density lipoprotein cholesterin (LDL-C) on hyperlipidemia human hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. PFM-3 recovered nuclear morphometry and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), enhanced the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and decreased cell arrest in G2 phase on oxidative stress HepG2 cells. In addition, PFM-3 promoted the decline of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and the augment of interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion on inflammatory mouse leukemia cells of monocyte macrophage (RAW 264.7). This work provides a certificate that PFM-3 could markedly improve cellular lipid accumulation, endogenous antioxidant defense capacity and inflammation levels to further use for treatment and amelioration of related diseases.

Effects of soy protein and beta-conglycinin on microbiota and invitro antioxidant and immunomodulatory capacities of human faecal cultures.		Food Hydrocolloids					To clarify the effects of soy protein (SP) and beta-conglycinin (BC) on human gut microbiota, human stool samples, collected from four healthy volunteers, were incubated without (control) or with 3% (w/v) SP and BC at 37 °C for 24 h under anaerobic conditions. During incubation, the amount of dissolved protein decreased and that of ammonia increased, although indole content was lower in both SP and BC cultures than in control cultures. The degraded protein band pattern, obtained by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, varied across individuals. Total organic acids tended to increase in amount in SP and BC cultures, with n-butyric acid levels increasing significantly (p< 0.05) in the BC culture. The gut microbiota were analysed using 16S rRNA (V4) gene amplicon sequencing. Genera regarded as butyrate producers, such as Roseburia, Butyricicoccus, and Faecalibacterium, were high in both SP and BC cultures, and the genera and amplicon sequence variants of butyrate producers varied across individuals. The incubation with SP and BC increased the superoxide anion radical scavenging capacity and ferric reducing power of the faecal cultures. As an invitro immunomodulatory activity, increased promotion of nitric oxide secretion in murine macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells was observed in the BC cultures. Overall, the effects of SP and BC were considered positive with respect to the host.

J		Yumeng Zhang; Yang Liu; Fei Peng; Xinrui Wei; Huiqin Hao; Wei Li; Yuqing Zhao							Cedrol from ginger alleviates rheumatoid arthritis through dynamic regulation of intestinal microenvironment.		Food & Function					The imbalance of intestinal flora would induce immune inflammation. Cedrol (CE), found from ginger by our group earlier, has been proven to play an excellent role in ameliorating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) via acting on JAK3, MAPK, and NF-kappaB. However, there have been no studies on CE ameliorating RA through the regulation of the micro-environment. In this study, the adjuvant arthritis model (AIA) is established to evaluate the weight, arthritis score, paw swelling, bone destruction, immune organ index, inflammatory cell infiltration, cartilage erosion, and metabolic enzymes of kidneys in AIA rats after CE intervention. The results indicated CE could alleviate paw swelling, reduce arthritis score, decrease the secretion of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and IL-1beta in serum in a dose-dependent manner, and inhibit the immune organ index of the spleen while having no significant effect on metabolic enzymes of the kidney. In addition, pathological sections of ankle and knee joints suggested CE might significantly prevent inflammatory cell infiltration, synovial hyperplasia, and joint degeneration and protect articular cartilage. Then, for the first time, 16S rRNA gene was applied to analyze the regulatory effect of CE on intestinal flora. CE could effectively improve the uniformity, diversity, and richness of intestinal flora, reduce the number of pathogenic bacteria, and increase the proportion of beneficial bacteria, and it significantly inhibited the abundance of Prevotella in RA rats, which was 12.43 times smaller than that in methotrexate. The distribution and excretion of CE in vivo were detected by GC-MS. It was found that CE would massively accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration, which is then mainly excreted through feces. Interestingly, the research suggested that CE, which plays a role in the dynamic regulation of the intestinal micro-environment, could be used as a potential component to prevent RA. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	22	11825	11839	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01983c					FSTA:2023-03-Te1029

The gel strength and water holding capacity were improved with the increase in ultrasound treatment time and protein concentration. A denser gel network with smaller pore size was formed. For gels made from MCC after ultrasound treatment for 60 min, the gel properties were especially improved. The particle size decreased, zeta potential and hydrophobicity increased after ultrasound treatment. Ultrasound treatment influenced the secondary structure of MCC while no change in the molecular weight of the protein was detected.

Food Chemistry					Summer green tea (SGT) has poor flavor due to its high levels of bitterness and astringency. The present study aimed to improve the flavor of SGT using the yellowing process. The results showed that after the yellowing process, the sweetness and overall acceptability increased, and the content of gallated catechins and flavonol glycosides decreased by 30.2% and 27.4%, respectively, as did the bitterness and astringency of SGT. Yellowing caused a decrease in the concentration of some aroma compounds, such as (z)-3-hexen-1-ol, 1-hexanol, pentanal, heptanal and 1-octanol, which caused grassy, floral and fruity aromas. In contrast, the concentrations of 1-octen-3-ol, benzene acetaldehyde and beta-ionone increased, which have mushroom and sweet aromas. Meanwhile, the sweetness and umami of SGT were enhanced by the addition of selected aroma compounds (1-octen-3-ol, benzene acetaldehyde and beta-ionone), demonstrating that the yellowing process improves the flavor of SGT through odor-taste interactions.

J		Yun Bai; Yulong Zhang; Xuhai Cui; Shaolin Deng; Tingxuan Gao; Xiaomei Sun; Guanghong Zhou; Xinglian Xu							Effect of high-pressure treatment on the heat-induced emulsion gelation of rabbit myosin.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of high-pressure treatment (100-200 MPa) on the emulsion and gelation properties of rabbit myosin were investigated. When the myosin treatment pressure was increased from 0.1 (control) to 150 MPa, the proportion of alpha-helix significantly decreased, those of beta-sheet and beta-turn significantly increased, and the absolute enthalpy value significantly increased (P< 0.05). Myosin emulsion exhibited increased storage modulus and loss modulus, increased gel strength, decreased centrifugal loss and a dense, compact network of emulsion gel when the myosin treatment pressure was increased from 0.1 to 150 MPa. When the treatment pressure was increased to 200 MPa, the emulsion showed decreased storage modulus and loss modulus, decreased gel strength, increased centrifugal loss, and a less compact network with large cavities and globular aggregates. Therefore, moderate pressure treatment (150 MPa) modified the myosin emulsion structure and improved the thermal, rheological and gelation properties of the myosin emulsion, while higher-pressure treatment (200 MPa) weakened the thermal, rheological and gelation properties of the emulsion.

Food & Function					Amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta)-induced cholinergic system and mitochondrial dysfunction are major risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous studies found that carnosic acid (CA), an important polyphenol antioxidant, could significantly delay Abeta1-42-mediated acute paralysis. However, many details and underlying mechanisms of CA's neuroprotection against Abeta-induced cholinergic system defects and mitochondrial dysfunction remain unclear. Herein, we deeply investigated the effects and the possible mechanisms of CA-mediated protection against Abeta toxicity in vivo through several AD Caenorhabditis elegans strains. The results showed CA delayed age-related paralysis and Abeta deposition, and significantly protected neurons from Abeta-induced toxicity. CA might downgrade the expression of ace-1 and ace-2genes, and upregulate cha-1 and unc-17genes to inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity and relieve Abeta-caused cholinergic system defects. Furthermore, CA might also ameliorate Abeta-induced mitochondrial imbalance and oxidative stress through up-regulating the expression of phb-1, phb-2, eat-3, and drp-1genes. The enhancements of the cholinergic system and mitochondrial function might be the reasons for the amelioration of Abeta-mediated toxicity and Abeta aggregation mediated by CA. These findings have helped us to understand the CA anti-Abeta activity in C. elegans and the potential mechanism of action. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	8	4624	4640	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02965g					FSTA:2022-08-Aj13142

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, four polyphenols (tea polyphenol, procyanidin, anthocyanin and gallic acid) were applied to crosslink with gelatin (G), in order to explore the crosslinking mechanisms of polyphenol-gelatin hydrogels with desirable properties and its potential applications. The results showed that the crosslinking effect of polyphenols with gelatin was affected by pH and the types and concentration of polyphenols. The network of polyphenol-gelatin on the microscopic level was ordered with 0.075% polyphenol (anthocyanin, tea polyphenol and procyanidin). The polyphenol-gelatin hydrogel exhibited the highest system stability and the best freeze-dried network structure at pH 8. According to the results of circular dichroism (CD), ultraviolet (UV), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), both the solutions and freeze-dried samples of polyphenol-gelatin under optimised conditions showed more ordered microstructure than pure gelatin. The addition of polyphenols posted significant impacts on changed the secondary structure of polyphenol-gelatin complexes. Also, the anthocyanin-gelatin hydrogel generally showed the higher encapsulation efficiency than pure gelatin and other polyphenol-gelatin samples, of which the highest mineral loading capacity (Mg, Mn and Cu) was 7.04% higher than that of pure gelatin, where anthocyanin acted as a crosslinker under alkaline condition that greatly improved the microstructure, stability and nutrition encapsulation efficiency of gelatin. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	11	7143	7155	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16057					FSTA:2023-02-Ae2950

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are incurable diseases with progressive loss of neural function and require urgent development of effective treatments. Carnosol (CL) reportedly has a pharmacological effect in the prevention of dementia. Nevertheless, the mechanisms of CL's neuroprotection are not entirely clear. The present study aimed to investigate the effects and mechanisms of CL-mediated neuroprotection through Caenorhabditis elegans models. First, CL restored ND protein homeostasis via inhibiting the IIS pathway, regulating MAPK signaling, and simultaneously activating molecular chaperone, thus inhibiting amyloid peptide (Abeta), polyglutamine (polyQ), and alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) deposition and reducing protein disruption-mediated behavioral and cognitive impairments as well as neuronal damages. Furthermore, CL could repair mitochondrial structural damage via improving the mitochondrial membrane protein function and mitochondrial structural homeostasis and improve mitochondrial functional defects via increasing adenosine triphosphate contents, mitochondrial membrane potential, and reactive oxygen species levels, suggesting that CL could improve the ubiquitous mitochondrial defects in NDs. More importantly, we found that CL activated mitochondrial kinetic homeostasis related genes to improve the mitochondrial homeostasis and dysfunction in NDs. Meanwhile, CL up-regulated unc-17, cho-1, and cha-1 genes to alleviate Abeta-mediated cholinergic neurological disorders and activated Notch signaling and the Wnt pathway to diminish polyQ-and alpha-syn-induced ASH neurons as well as dopaminergic neuron damages. Overall, our study clarified the beneficial anti-ND neuroprotective effects of CL in different aspects and provided new insights into developing CL into products with preventive and therapeutic effects on NDs.										2022	70	34	10490	10505	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02665					FSTA:2023-01-Te0352

Food Research International					Stemness decline of muscle stem cells (MuSCs) is a significant problem in cultured meat processing. In the present study, three flavonoids (quercetin, icariin, and 3,2′-dihydroxyflavone) with multi concentrations were evaluated to promote the proliferation and differentiation of porcine muscle stem cells. In the proliferation phase, 3,2′-dihydroxyflavone (10 muM) significantly amplified the cells by 34% and up-regulated the expression of paired box transcription factor 7 (PAX7) by 60%, which was higher than quercetin (75 nM) and icariin (7.5 nM). In the differentiation phase, quercetin (50 nM) showed the best pro-differentiation effect and up-regulated the expression of myosin heavy chain (MYHC) by 4.73-fold compared with the control group. These results indicated that flavonoids had a significant impact on promoting the proliferation and differentiation of porcine MuSCs, and 3,2′-dihydroxyflavone (10 muM) for proliferation and quercetin (50 nM) for differentiation were the optimal combinations.

Food Control					Ice is widely used for the preservation of perishable seafood but not much effective in killing bacteria. Herein, in this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of slightly acid electrolysed water (SAEW) ice on the microbial spoilage together with the quality parameters to elucidate the underlying preservative mechanism. The results indicated that SAEW ice exhibited inhibitory activity toward polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and acid phosphatase (ACP) with 55.3% and 61.9% reduction of activity at day 7, respectively, along with less discolouration and the lowest K-value of shrimp. Besides, the growth of aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria was retarded by SAEW ice treatment (2.4 and 0.4 log CFU/g reduction, respectively). 16S rDNA-based Illumina sequencing elucidated that SAEW ice efficiently retarded the growth of Proteobacteria. Specifically, the growth of major spoilage genus presented in tap water (TW) ice treated shrimp (Shewanella, Vibrio, and Aeromonas) and NaCl ice treated shrimp (Psychrobacter) was inhibited in SAEW ice treated shrimp, which further led to the smallest increase of putrescine and cadaverine, together with the lowest values of pH and TVB-N during storage. The sensory results indicated that SAEW treatment maintained the quality of shrimp during storage in terms of colour, appearance, and texture. Overall, the SAEW ice exhibited a promising preservative effect on shrimp. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	136				0956-7135				10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.108876					FSTA:2022-06-Re2361
J		Yun Hu; Naiyong Xiao; Yiting Ye; Wenzheng Shi							Fish proteins as potential precursors of taste-active compounds: an in silico study.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Fish protein is a good source of amino acids and peptides with sensory properties. Theoretically, the type of protein affects the taste quality of the protein hydrolysates. To better use fish protein in the food ingredients industry, an in silico approach was adopted to evaluate the potential of fish protein to release taste-active compounds. Results. Six types of protein from seven commercial fishes were screened from the Uniprot knowledge base. The results showed that a remarkable number of umami fragments presented in myosin and parvalbumin (PB), such as glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), and Asp-and Glu-containing peptides, whereas sweet amino acids and bitter peptides (e.g., Pro-and Gly-containing peptides) were mainly found in collagen (CGI) in all fish samples. After the in silico proteolysis by papain, a difference in the profile of taste-active fragments was observed among the six types of proteins. Amino acids were the main hydrolysis products of these proteins, especially umami, sweet, and bitter amino acids, significantly contributing to the taste formation of protein hydrolysates. Besides, the myosin and CGI hydrolysates were abundant in taste active peptides both in types and quantities. Conclusion. Myosin is a promising protein source for producing umami fragments, and CGI seems to be a good precursor of sweet and bitter fragments. Different types of protein have an essential effect on the taste of protein hydrolysates. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	14	6404	6413	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12006					FSTA:2023-01-Rc0442

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. To overcome the limitations in the use of protein as an emulsifier, soy lecithin, a natural surfactant, was used along with whey protein isolate (WPI) to produce o/w emulsions containing cholecalciferol and alpha-tocopherol. The physical stability of the emulsions prepared with WPI and varying concentrations of lecithin (0,1, 2, and 3% w/w) was measured in different heat, pH, and ionic-strength food environmental conditions. Results. All emulsions were shown to be less than 250nm in size and less than 0.3 in polydispersity index (PDI). The morphology of the emulsions was spherical, and the droplets of the emulsion containing lecithin were thicker and larger than those of the emulsion without lecithin (WPI_L0). After autoclaving, WPI_L0 increased in size from 197.8 1.7 nm to 528.5 28.4 nm, and the retention of cholecalciferol and alpha-tocopherol decreased to 40.83 0.63% and 49.68 1.84%, respectively. At pH 5.5, near the isoelectric point of WPI, WPI_L0 increased in size due to aggregation, but emulsions containing lecithin remained stable at a PDI under 0.3. Turbiscan stability index of the emulsion prepared with WPI and 3% lecithin was the lowest, indicating good storage stability. In addition, it was confirmed that the higher the lecithin content, the higher the viscosity, and the higher the amount of free fatty acids released in the in vitro digestion model. Conclusion. This study can provide theoretical evidence for enhancing the physical stability of protein emulsions by co-stabilization with lecithin, promoting their application in various foods. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	13	5738	5749	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11923					FSTA:2022-12-Ae24039
J		Yun Shuang Duwee; Loo Kiew, P.; Wei Ming Yeoh							Multi-objective optimization of pectin extraction from orange peel via response surface methodology: yield and degree of esterification.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Pectin is extensively extracted from citrus peel for applications in food, nutrition, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. In this study, extraction of pectin from orange peels was attempted using different types of acid solvent, namely acetic, hydrochloric, nitric and citric acids. Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy revealed that distinctive functional groups of pectin were found in the extracted pectin samples using all acid solvents and the spectra were comparable to the commercial pectin reported in literature. Citric acid was identified as the best extracting solvent for the highest pectin yield (3.82%) and optimum degree of esterification (DE) (>50%) for the extracted pectin. Multi-objective optimization of the extraction process was performed using Response Surface Methodology on the yield and degree of esterification. A five-level Central Composite Design was adopted for the experimental design involving three process variables namely extraction temperature (60-90°C), solvent pH (2-4) and extraction time (30-90 min). The highest pectin yield at 35.20 0.39% and DE of 45.43 0.39% was achieved at the suggested optimum extraction conditions at 90°C, solvent pH 2.19 and 66 min. Verification of the optimization showed that the percentage error difference between the experimental and predicted results was less than 10%, indicating significance of the established extraction model and correlation. Interestingly, the DE (<50%) of the extracted pectin at optimal conditions revealed that low methoxyl (LM) pectin was obtained rather than high methoxyl (HM) pectin as extracted during the solvent screening process. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	2	1710	1724	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01305-5					FSTA:2022-12-Jc17094

Food Bioscience					Whey protein isolate (WPI) was dietary protein with various functional properties and nutritional value, while anthocyanins were famous for their biological activities. This study aimed to investigate the effect of the interaction between WPI and rose anthocyanin extract (RAEs) at pH 7.0 and pH 9.0 on the structure, emulsification, and digestibility of WPI. The results showed that compared with the initial WPI, all WPI-RAEs complexes presented lower hydrophobicity and free SH content, higher absolute zeta-potential, thermal stability, and emulsification. In addition, the interaction of WPI and RAEs could reduce the digestibility of WPI. More importantly, WPI-RAEs complexes may be more effective emulsifiers than the original WPI, which was of great value to the dairy processing industry and food nutrition.

Food Chemistry					The non-covalent interaction between anthocyanin and dietary protein had an impact on their physicochemical property. The purpose of this study was to study the non-covalent interaction mechanism between rose anthocyanin extract (RAEs) and whey protein isolate (WPI), and further compare the interaction mechanism with pure anthocyanin (PC) and WPI. At pH 3.0 and pH 7.0, RAEs and WPI had non-covalent interactions in the two systems with two types of unequal and mutually influencing binding sites, and the interaction forces were both hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. Interestingly, PC and WPI also had non-covalent interactions in both systems, the number of which binding sites was about one type, and the forces were hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces. In addition, a variety of spectral combination techniques indicated that RAEs and PC caused similar changes in the secondary structure of WPI.

Food Chemistry					Many anthocyanins were used in active and pH-responsive packaging. The purpose of the study was to prepare an active and pH-responsive sensitive film based on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose/polyvinyl alcohol (CPVA) by a casting process, which contained rose anthocyanin extracts (RAEs) to monitor the freshness of pork. The concentration of RAEs had an important influence on the physicochemical property of RAEs-CPVA films, especially excellent anti-oxidation and light barrier properties. Importantly, the 160-RAEs-CPVA film had a strong response to pH, showing different color at different pHs. Furthermore, when monitoring the freshness of pork stored at 25°C, the light green color of the 160-RAEs-CPVA film indicated that the freshness of the pork was higher, while the dark green and orange appearance indicated that the pork was spoiled. Therefore, 160-RAEs-CPVA film can be used as a smart indicator for freshness monitoring of pork.

D.; Nur Hossain, M.; Leonard, W.; Zhongxiang Fang							Effect of sorghum bran incorporation on the physicochemical and microbial properties of beef sausage during cold storage.		Food Control					Sorghum bran is a rich source of phenolic compounds with potent antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This study investigated the effect of brown and black sorghum bran incorporation on the physicochemical and microbiological properties of beef sausages during cold storage at 4 °C. Results showed that the incorporation of sorghum bran in sausages, unexpectedly, promoted sausage discolouration, oxidation and pH fluctuation. The addition of sorghum bran in sausages significantly increased the texture values, including hardness, cohesiveness, resilience, gumminess and chewiness. In sorghum-added sausages, the total plate count, yeast & moulds count, and total Coliforms were inhibited only for the first 5-10 days, followed by a rapid increase, whilst the pathogenic Escherichia coli and Listeria spp. were inhibited throughout storage. Brown and black sorghum bran treatments had similar effects on sausages, and the effects were dependent on the amount of bran added. Although this study did not confirm the antioxidant effect of sorghum bran in meat application, it did demonstrate that sorghum bran has some antimicrobial activity, both of which require further evidence for verification.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) was used as the oil-soluble surfactant and beeswax was used as the oil phase to formulate a water-in-oil (W/O) high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) for the encapsulation and protection of probiotics. The physicochemical properties of the W/O HIPEs and the survival of the encapsulated probiotics when exposed to acidic conditions and in vitro digestion were investigated. The viability of the probiotics decreased slightly when exposed to high-speed shearing. The rheological analysis, microstructural images, physicochemical stability showed that the W/O HIPEs remained relatively stable. The survival of the probiotics loaded in the SK-HIPEs (prepared with skim milk) was much higher than in the NS-HIPEs (prepared with normal saline) during storage at 4°C. An in vitro gastrointestinal model showed that encapsulation of the probiotics enhanced their survival. This study provides useful insights into the utilization of W/O HIPEs to improve the efficacy of probiotics in the food industry.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The expansion of the global population and improved living standards has created an increasing demand for fresh fruit. The combination of agricultural and medical development for new fungicides is one of the most effective approaches for keeping fruit fresh. Both amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine are quite safe and have a wide spectrum of antifungal activity. For the purpose of investigating their potential applications for preserving fruit freshness, we evaluated their antifungal efficiencies against Penicillium italicum in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine significantly inhibited spore germination and the mycelial growth of P. italicum. The 5-flucytosine showed much better bioactivity than the well-known agricultural fungicide prochloraz, both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, crystal violet staining, propidium iodide dyeing, ultrastructural observation and the ergosterol content indicated that amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine destroyed the cellular ultrastructure and membrane integrity. In addition, nucleic acids (OD260) and proteins (OD280) escaped from P. italicum cells in a dose-dependent manner. The results of this study indicated that amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine have good potential as antifungal preservatives for postharvest citrus fruit due to their excellent antifungal effects, and that the primary mode of action was the destruction of the membrane integrity and permeability of P. italicum.

Foods					This study aimed to determine whether fermented soy sauce has a mutually synergistic effect on the quality and storage properties of pork patties, and to investigate the effects on the availability and physicochemical properties of various taste ingredients of soy sauce, a traditional Korean food ingredient. The experimental groups were as follows: control (-): no additives; control (+): 0.1% ascorbic acid; T1: 1% fermented soy sauce; T2: 3% fermented soy sauce; T3: 5% fermented soy sauce. No significant difference was detected in moisture, protein, and fat among the various treatment groups; however, ash content and water holding capacity increased and texture properties improved with the concentration of fermented soy sauce. The addition of fermented soy sauce during refrigerated storage for 10 days showed a positive effect on the storage properties. The peroxide value, content of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total phenolics, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl free radical scavenging activity differed significantly in pork patties with different treatments and storage intervals. The effect of fermented soy sauce on the overall quality and storage properties of pork patties during refrigerated storage is relatively unknown. These findings demonstrate that the addition of fermented soy sauce improves the quality properties and antioxidant activity of pork patties. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Control					To elucidate the effect of gaseous ozone with different dose and exposing time (A and B: 1mg/m3 or 3mg/m3 for 5min; C and D: 1 or 3mg/m3 for 10min, respectively, corona discharge method) on the quality of salmon, the microbial growth, lipid oxidation, color, odor characteristics, microbiota, and the correlations between them were studied. The results showed that the total viable counts of groups C (6.05 log CFU/g) and D (5.71 log CFU/g) were lower than the control (7.08 log CFU/g) on day 10. The ozone treatment also retarded the increase of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid substances (TBARS), and drip losses as well as the decrease of sensory scores. Though the ozonated treatment led to a slight decrease of a* value, it could deodorize the fishy smell. The results of next-generation sequencing showed that the relative abundance of Photobacterium decreased after treatments, but recovered during storage, and it was the predominant bacteria causing the deterioration of salmon fillets according to the correlation analysis with sensory score, TVB-N, and TBARS values. The results demonstrated that gaseous ozone was a promising method for salmon preservation, and the exposing time had a greater effect on the salmon quality than the ozone concentrations in this study. The ozonation treatment with the dose of 1 or 3mg/m3 for 10min was recommended for salmon fillets.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Radiation-induced liver damage (RILD) is a spiny problem in radiotherapy or other circumstances that exposure to radiation. The need for radioprotective agent is increasing to protect liver tissue. This study aimed to explore the hepatoprotective effect of p-coumaric acid (CA) against RILD. C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to 4 Gy irradiation and administrated with CA for 4 days starting on the same day of irradiation. Mice were sacrificed to obtain blood and liver tissues on day 3.5 or 14 post irradiation, respectively. The blood and liver tissues were collected. As compared with the only irradiated group, CA supplementation improved liver morphology, decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, inhibited BCL2-associated X (BAX) protein expression, and improved the mice hematopoietic function. CA at the dose of 100mg/kg body weight showed better effect compared to the other doses. Thus, CA might possess potential to protect against RILD. ©The Author(s) 2022.										2022	31	10	1315	1323	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-022-01118-8					FSTA:2022-12-Aj22682

The optimum conditions for the Maillard reaction between rice protein and dextran were 90 °C, pH 11,60 min, and the mass ratio of RP to dextran was 1:3. The solubility of the RP-dextran conjugates in the buffer solution of pH 7-9 was greater than 80%. The high solubility of the RP-dextran conjugate was due to the introduction of dextran. Dextran covalently bound to RP has many hydrophilic hydroxyl groups, which reduced the ratio of hydrophobic groups on the surface of RP. At the same time, the emulsification and foaming properties of the RP-dextran conjugates were greatly improved compared to that of original RP. The application of crowded conditions can be used as a new way to enhance the reaction, improve the solubility of rice protein, while retaining the protein structure, thus contributing to the industrialized application of rice proteins.

Food Chemistry					Vinylpyrazine compounds are widely present in foods, especially in hot-processed foods, as a class of flavor compounds; however, their formation mechanism in food systems is still unclear. Therefore, in this study, 2-vinylpyrazine and 2-vinyl-6-methylpyrazine were identified in the Maillard model reaction of D-glucose and glycine. The Maillard model reaction of glucose-glycine was constructed to explore the effects of reaction parameters on vinylpyrazines and the related products. The Maillard reaction of [U-13C6] glucose and glycine was established, and alkylpyrazines and formaldehyde were determined via isotope tracing technique as the precursors of vinylpyrazines. The formation of vinylpyrazines was verified by building a model reaction between alkylpyrazines and formaldehyde. The H/D exchange experiment confirmed that the active site of alkylpyrazines was on the methyl group, which was the reaction site for the condensation reaction of alkylpyrazines with formaldehyde. Results suggest that vinylpyrazines are formed by the condensation reaction of alkylpyrazines and formaldehyde.

J		Yun-Jiao Shi; Xin-Huai Zhao							Impact of the plastein reaction of casein hydrolysates in the presence of exogenous amino acids on their anti-inflammatory effect in the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages.		Foods					In this study, papain-generated casein hydrolysates (CH) with a degree of hydrolysis of 13.7% were subjected to a papain-mediated plastein reaction in the absence or presence of one of the exogenous amino acids-Gly, Pro, and Hyp-to prepare four plastein modifiers, or mixed with one of three amino acids to prepare three mixtures. The assay results confirmed that the reaction reduced free NH2 for the modifiers and caused amino acid incorporation and peptide condensation. When RAW264.7 macrophages were exposed to the CH, modifiers, and mixtures, these samples promoted macrophage growth and phagocytosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the CH shared similar activity in the cells as the mixtures, while the modifiers (especially the PCH-Hyp prepared with Hyp addition) exerted higher potential than CH, the mixtures, and PCH (the modifier prepared without amino acid addition). The plastein reaction thus enhanced CH bioactivity in the cells. When RAW264.7 macrophages were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), the inflammatory cells produced more lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, and caused more four inflammatory mediators (NO, PGE2, TNF-alpha, and IL-6) and two anti-inflammatory mediators (TGF-beta1 and IL-10). However, the PCH-Hyp, PCH, and CH at dose levels of 100mug/mL could combat against the LPS-induced inflammation. Overall, the PCH-Hyp was more active than the CH and PCH in reducing LDH release, ROS formation, and the secretion of these inflammatory mediators, or in increasing the secretion of the anti-inflammatory mediators. The qPCR and Western blot analysis results further confirmed that these samples had anti-inflammatory effects on the stimulated cells by suppressing the LPS-induced activation of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, via regulating the mRNA/miRNA expression of iNOS, IL-6, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2, TLR4, IL-10, TGF-beta1, miR-181a, miR-30d, miR-155, and miR-148, as well as the protein expression of MyD88, p-IKKalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, p-NF-kappaB p65, and iNOS, involved in this signaling pathway. In addition, the immunofluorescence assay results revealed that these samples could block the LPS-mediated nuclear translocation of the p65 protein and displayed the same function as the NF-kappaB inhibitor BAY 11-7082. It was concluded that CH could be endowed with higher anti-inflammatory activity to the macrophages by performing a plastein reaction, particularly that in the presence of exogenous Hyp. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Algae oil from Schizochytrium sp. is one of the major natural sources of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), but its applications in foods are limited because of its unpleasant odor. The complex composition of algae oil originates an odor profile that differs from that of its major PUFA, i.e. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The aim of this work was to explore the specific role of DHA oxidation in the odor profile of algae oil. According to the fatty acid composition and odor characteristics, oxidized sunflower oil was selected and combined with oxidized DHA to simulate the odor profile of algae oil. The recombination oil showed similar odor characteristics to the algae oil sample indicating that DHA oxidation was key in the formation of the unpleasant odor in algae oil and that oxidation of fatty acids other than DHA also made a contribution. The constructed off-flavor of algae oil was a consequence of a synthetic effect between odorants from oxidized DHA and oxidized oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid. This study provided a reference for the source research of volatile substances producing fishy odor in algae oil.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (MS) are indispensable analytical tools to provide chemical fingerprints in metabolomics studies. The present study evaluated radiation breeding wheat lines for chemical changes by non-targeted NMR-based metabolomics analysis of bran extracts. Multivariate analysis following spectral binning suggested pyrrole-2-carbaldehydes as chemical markers of four mutant lines with distinct NMR fingerprints in a deltaH range of 9.28-9.40 ppm. Further NMR and MS data analysis, along with chromatographic fractionation and synthetic preparation, aimed at structure identification of marker metabolites and identified five pyrrole-2-carbaldehydes. Quantum-mechanical driven1H iterative full spin analysis (QM-HiFSA) on synthetic pyrrole-2-carbaldehydes provided a precise description of complex peak patterns. Biological evaluation of pyrrole-2-carbaldehydes was performed with nine synthetic products, and six compounds showed hepatoprotective effects via modulation of reactive oxygen species production. Given that three out of five identified in wheat bran of radiation were described for hepatoprotective activity, the value of radiation mutation to greatly enhance pyrrole-2-carbaldehyde production was supported.										2022	70	40	13002	13014	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04771					FSTA:2023-02-Mj0963

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Lactoferrin (Lf) is a bioactive protein with varied biological effects. To improve its anti-digestive stability in oral administration, a novel nanocarrier with high hydrophobicity for colonic delivery of Lf was creatively developed by modified coaxial electrospinning. First, a suitable biocompatible solvent, acetic acid, was screened as the mono-solvent for ES100 electrospinning, creating highly-hydrophobic ES100 nanofiber mat (contact angle = 133.8o). Then, Lf-loaded W/O emulsion was prepared as the core fluid to ensure the successful coaxial electrospinning and generate Lf encapsulated core/shell nanofiber mat (ES@Lf). Lf was demonstrated maintaining structural integrity and anti-colon cancer activity during encapsulation and oral delivery. In vitro assay indicated 92.3% Lf was sustainably released in colon, and its release followed a complex mechanism in which the erosion was dominant. Instead of pH-dependent erosion, the synergistic action through gut microbiota adhesion and their metabolites, especially short-chain fatty acids, was illustrated for disintegration of ES@Lf nanofiber for the first time.

J		Yun-Shi Xia; Zhi-Man Li; Chang Liu; Rui Mu; Pan-Pan Bo; Zi Wang; Yin-Shi Sun							Preparation of deer oil powder and its effect on acute gastric mucosal injury in rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this paper, deer oil was used as a raw material to prepare deer oil powder by microencapsulation technology to study the potential protective activity of deer oil powder on ethanol-induced acute gastric mucosal injury in rats. The results show that the best process for preparing deer oil powder is: the solids account for 25% of the system content, the wall material Whey Milk Protein Isolate-Maltodextrin ratio is 1:5, the Sodium Stearyl Lactate-Glycerides of Monostearate and Distearate compound emulsifier content is 0.8%, the ratio is 1:1, and the deer oil accounts for 30% of the solid content, and the spray drying inlet temperature is 180°C. Deer oil powder can reduce total stomach injury, gastric mucosal congestion area, and injury score index. Without affecting the blood lipid level, it can reduce the content of Myeloperoxidase, enhance the activity of Superoxide Dismutase and Glutathione Peroxidase, and has good antioxidant activity. Enhance the expression of defense factors Estradiol, Epidermal Growth Factor, and Somatostatin. At the same time, it reduces the levels of Interleukin-1beta and Interleukin-6 pro-inflammatory cytokines in gastric tissue and enhances the expression of anti-inflammatory factors Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10. These results indicate that the gastric protection mechanism of deer oil powder may be related to the enhancement of mucosal defense factors, inhibition of inflammation, and oxidative stress. Practical applications. This study screened the optimal formula for preparing microencapsulated deer oil powder and proved for the first time that deer oil powder has a strong gastroprotective effect on ethanol-induced acute gastric injury in rats. The gastric protective mechanism of deer oil powder is mainly to reduce oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokine accumulation and to increase the content of defense factors. Therefore, deer oil powder can be used as a new source of gastric treatment drugs. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	5			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14088					FSTA:2022-09-Nh2021

Food & Function					Tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) skin high value-added compounds have not been fully utilized in tilapia processing. Here, the protective effects of tilapia skin peptides (TSP) on primary ovarian failure (POF) and their underlying mechanisms in mice were investigated. Cyclophosphamide (CP) was injected intraperitoneally (ip) for 14 days (10 mg kg-1 d-1) to establish a mouse model of POF. At the same time, the mice were given intragastrically (ig) TSP for 30 days (250 mg kg-1 d-1, 500 mg kg-1 d-1, and 1000 mg kg-1 d-1, respectively). The ovarian index, estrous cycle, hormone level, changes in the number of follicles at various levels, and biochemical tests were carried out at the end of the experiment. The body weight and ovarian index of mice in the POF group were markedly lower than that of the control group. Treatment with TSP reversed these changes significantly. TSP administration significantly restored the estrous cycle disorder of the mice versus that of the POF group. The level changes of progesterone (P), estradiol (E2), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) induced by CP were significantly reversed by TSP treatment. TSP inhibited oxidative stress in CP-induced mice by enhancing the total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) activity and reducing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in the ovaries. TSP improved the apoptosis of ovarian granulosa cells in CP-induced mice compared with the POF group. Furthermore, TSP regulated the Bcl-2/Bax/caspase-3 apoptosis pathway and enhanced the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, TSP could improve CP-induced POF via alleviating ovarian oxidative stress and granulosa cell apoptosis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1668	1679	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04239d					FSTA:2022-06-Rc2041

L.; Chenzhong Liao; Zhao-Jun Wei							Riboflavin bioenriched soymilk alleviates oxidative stress mediated liver injury, intestinal inflammation, and gut microbiota modification in B2 depletion-repletion mice.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Epidemiological evidence emphasizes that ariboflavinosis can lead to oxidative stress, which in turn may mediate the initiation and progression of liver injury and intestinal inflammation. Although vitamin B2 has gained worldwide attention for its antioxidant defense, the relationship between B2 status, oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and intestinal homeostasis remains indistinct. Herein, we developed a B2 depletion-repletion BALB/c mice model to investigate the ameliorative effects of B2 bioenriched fermented soymilk (B2FS) on ariboflavinosis, accompanied by oxidative stress, inflammation, and gut microbiota modulation in response to B2 deficiency. In vivo results revealed that the phenotypic ariboflavinosis symptoms, growth rate, EGRAC status, and hepatic function reverted to normal after B2FS supplementation. B2FS significantly elevated CAT, SOD, T-AOC, and compromised MDA levels in the serum, simultaneously up-regulated Nrf2, CAT, and SOD2, and down-regulated Keap1gene in the colon. The histopathological characteristics revealed significant alleviation in the liver and intestinal inflammation, confirmed by the downregulation of inflammatory (IL-1beta and IL-6) and nuclear transcription (NF-kappaB) factors after B2FS supplementation. B2FS also increased the abundance and diversity of gut microbiota, increased the relative abundance of Prevotella and Absiella, as well as decreased Proteobacteria, Fusobacteria, Synergistetes, and Cyanobacteria in strong conjunction with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties, and gut homeostasis along with the remarkable increase in cecal SCFAs content. We hereby reveal that B2FS can effectively alleviate deleterious ariboflavinosis associated with oxidative stress mediated liver injury, chronic intestinal inflammation, and gut dysbiosis in the B2 depletion-repletion mice model via activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway.										2022	70	12	3818	3831	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00117					FSTA:2022-07-Jn10201
J		Yuna Lee; Nakano, A.; Nagasato, Y.; Ichinose, T.; Matsui, T.							In vitro and in silico analyses of the adiponectin receptor agonistic action of soybean tripeptides.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The Tyr-Pro (YP) dipeptide can serve as an adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) agonist. We thus investigated the AdipoR1-agonistic potential of YP-related tripeptides in the soybean protein sequence. Among the 17 soybean candidate tripeptides, those elongated at the C-terminus of YP (0.1muM YPG, 140 16%; 0.1muM YPE, 141 22%; 0.1muM YPP, 145 19%; 0.1muM YPQ, 143 20%; p< 0.05) significantly promoted glucose uptake by L6 muscle myotubes, comparable to the effect of 0.1muM AdipoRon (163 52%, p< 0.05). The knockdown of AdipoR1 expression in L6 cells abrogated this effect of YPG and YPP, indicating that the two tripeptides had an AdipoR1 agonistic effect. CHARMM-GUI-aided molecular dynamics simulation in a virtual phospholipid membrane revealed that YPG and YPP were stably positioned at the binding pockets of AdipoR1 (binding free energy <-10 kcal/mol). These findings demonstrate that the tripeptides YPG and YPP, with AdipoR1 agonistic YP sequences, have alternative adiponectin-like potential via their preferential binding to AdipoR1.										2022	70	25	7695	7703	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02115					FSTA:2022-11-Jn15112

Journal of Dairy Science					Free exopolysaccharide (f-EPS) produced by Streptococcus thermophilus improves the texture and functionality of fermented dairy foods. Our previous study showed a major improvement in f-EPS production of Strep. thermophilus 937 by increasing the concentrations of histidine, isoleucine, and glutamate to 15 mM in an optimized chemically defined medium. The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of His, Ile, and Glu on the growth, f-EPS biosynthesis pathway, and carbohydrate metabolism profiles of Strep. thermophilus 937. The growth kinetics; transcript levels of key genes in the EPS biosynthesis pathway; enzyme activity involved in sugar nucleotide synthesis; concentrations of lactic acid, lactose, and galactose; and extracellular and intracellular pH were analyzed in chemically defined media with different initial histidine, isoleucine, and glutamate concentrations. The results showed that f-EPS production and viable cell counts of Strep. thermophilus 937 increased 2-fold after the concentrations of His, Ile, and Glu were increased. Additionally, increasing the concentrations of His, Ile, and Glu upregulated transcription of EPS biosynthesis genes and increased the activity of key enzymes in sugar nucleotide synthesis. Moreover, the consumption of lactose increased and secretion of galactose decreased, indicating that increasing the concentration of His, Ile, and Glu could enhance f-EPS production by maintaining viable cell counts, promoting sugar nucleotide synthesis, and increasing the transcript levels of the eps gene cluster. Our results provide a better understanding of the effect of AA on EPS biosynthesis in Strep. thermophilus.

Journal of Functional Foods					Shenqishiyiwei granules (SQSYW) is an approved traditional Chinese medicine formulation used as an adjuvant for cancer patients in China, which includes several medicine food homology herbs. Accumulating studies have reported that SQSYW reduces the side effects of chemotherapy and improves the quality of life of patients with gastric cancer (GC). However, the mechanism of action of SQSYW in GC remains unclear. Here, the pharmacological mechanism of action of SQSYW in GC was investigated. The Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database was used to identify 98 active compounds and 241 protein targets of SQSYW, while 3932 GC-related proteins were identified from DisGeNET. The 182 overlapping targets of SQSYW and GC represented the potential therapeutic targets of SQSYW in GC. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis indicated that the overlapping targets were mostly enriched in the regulation of apoptotic process, programmed cell death, and immune processes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis indicated that SQSYW could prevent GC via the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways and apoptosis. Molecular docking revealed that sesamin interacted with several proteins involved in immune processes, including IKBKB, TNF superfamily (TNFSF) 13B, IL2, PRKCB, and SIRT1. The findings demonstrated that the anti-GC activity of SQSYW could be mediated via the regulation of proteins involved in immune processes, and provides evidence that support the potential therapeutic application of SQSYW in GC.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The purpose of this study was to expound on the correlation between foaming properties and physicochemical characteristics of rice bran protein (RBP) samples. RBP nano-particles (RBPNs) were prepared by acidic-thermal treatment under different RBP solution concentrations and treated times at 90°C, and then the foaming properties were measured at pH 7.0 and pH 2.0. Compared to RBP, the foaming properties of RBPNs were increased at pH 7.0, and RBPNs could have better foam capacity but have no obvious changes in foam stability at pH 2.0. The results of Pearson correlation showed that the foaming properties were closely correlated with zeta potential, contact angle, and surface hydrophobicity for RBP and RBPNs, and a strong correlation between foaming capacity and surface hydrophobicity was shown for RBPNs. Additionally, the result of TEM images confirmed that RBPNs were inclined to form associated aggregates which may affect the physicochemical characteristics of RBPNs. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	6	3624	3633	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15686					FSTA:2022-09-Me5155

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The combination of the insufficient availability and the complex structure of siamenoside I (SI), the sweetest glucoside isolated from Siraitia grosvenorii to date, limited its use as a natural sweetener. To solve this problem, an improved biocatalyst, UGT-M2, was semi-rationally created by engineering the uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase UGT94-289-2 from S. grosvenorii for the monoglucosylation of mogroside IIIE (MG IIIE) to SI. Subsequently, an engineered Escherichia coli cell was constructed, which combined UGT-M2 with a UDP-glucose regeneration system to circumvent the need for expensive UDP-glucose to produce SI. After optimization, high-purity SI (>96.4%) was efficiently prepared from MG IIIE at a 1 L scale with a productivity of 29.78 g/ (L day) and a molar yield of 76.5% and without using exogenous UDP-glucose. This study not only developed a whole-cell approach for the preparation of SI but also provided an alternative glycosyltransferase variant for SI biosynthesis with synthetic biology in the future.										2022	70	5	1601	1609	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07699					FSTA:2022-06-Bi1033
J		Yunfan Zheng; Yueyan Huang; Zejing Mao; Yanchun Shao							Histone deacetylase MrRpd3 plays a major regulational role in the mycotoxin production of Monascus ruber.		Food Control					Monascus spp. are filamentous fungi, which can produce Monascus azaphilone pigments, monaklin K and other beneficial secondary metabolites, and they can also produce a mycotoxin citrinin. In this study, the gene Mrrpd3, encoding Rpd3-like histone deacetylase was overexpressed to evaluate its regulation on the production of pigments and mycotoxin in Monascus ruber. RT-qPCR confirmed the expression of Mrrpd3 was increased in the Mrrpd3-overexpressing strain. UPLC detection showed Mrrpd3-overexpressing strain enhanced the citrinin content by 61.9%, 56.5% and 52.6% at the 3rd day, 9th day and 11th day, respectively. But overexpression of Mrrpd3 had no significant effect on pigments production. RT-qPCR results showed that overexpression of Mrrpd3 significantly increased the relative expression of citrinin biosynthetic pathway genes including pksCT, mrl1, mrl2, mrl4, mrl6 and mrl7. Western blot results suggested that overexpression of Mrrpd3 caused the decrease of acetylation modification of total protein and histone H3K27. Overall, these results indicate that Mrrpd3 plays an important role in regulating citrinin production of Monascus ruber. This study provides important insights into the mechanisms underlying the effects of the Mrrpd3 gene on the citrinin of Monascus ruber.

J		Yunfei Dai; Haiyan Gao; Jie Zeng; Yufen Liu; Yueqi Qin; Mengyu Wang							Effect of subfreezing storage on the qualities of dough and bread containing pea protein.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In this paper, -6, -9 and -12°C were selected as subfreezing temperatures of dough containing pea protein based on the results of low-field nuclear magnetic relaxation time. The effect of storage at subfreezing temperatures on dough properties was then investigated and compared with sample storage at -18°C. Results. The pH value, springiness, resilience, cohesiveness of dough and sensory score of bread gradually decreased and the hardness and water loss rate of dough gradually increased with the extension of storage time. However, dough hardness, viscoelasticity and fermentation volume were maintained more effectively in subfreezing storage than in -18°C storage. The subfreezing temperature could alleviate the damage of gluten network structure in frozen dough by ice crystals and was beneficial in maintaining the elasticity of gluten proteins. The network system of pea protein, gluten protein and starch granules in dough storage at -9 and -12°C was more tightly connected and the microstructure was similar to that at -18°C. There was no significant difference between the quality of bread made from the dough stored at subfreezing temperature and that stored at-18°C for 1-6 weeks, and the preservation effect at -12°C was closer to that at -18°C. Conclusion. Subfreezing storage can keep the stability of dough containing pea protein close to traditional frozen storage (-18°C), which provides a new method for storage and transportation of frozen dough. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	12	5378	5388	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11891					FSTA:2022-12-Mn7099

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Lettuce is one of the major fresh-cut products in the market. However, browning is the main cause of quality loss in fresh-cut lettuce during storage. Here, the effects of different hormones on the browning control in fresh-cut lettuce were investigated. Results showed that 6-Benzylaminopurine (6-BA) was the optimal hormone to delay the fresh-cut lettuce browning. Metabolome profiling showed that 392 metabolites were detected in fresh-cut lettuce, including 250 primary metabolites and 92 secondary metabolites. Five phenolic-related metabolites, including chrysin O-malonylhexoside, calycosin-7-O-glucoside, chrysoeriol 7-O-rutinoside, glycitin, and scopoletin, increased with browning but reduced by 6-BA treatment. Transcriptome profiling revealed that phenolic-related metabolites pathways, especially the scopoletin, were enriched by differentially expressed genes, supporting that 6-BA reduced the fresh-cut lettuce browning through transcriptional regulation of phenolic-related metabolites biosynthesis, and scopoletin could serve as a marker compound for browning prediction. These results suggest that 6-BA is a promising anti-browning agent for fresh-cut lettuce.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Patulin (PAT) is a common mycotoxin, widely found in cereals, seafood, nuts, and especially in fruits and their products. Exposure to this mycotoxin has been reported to induce kidney injury. However, the possible mechanism remains unclear. In our study, short-term high-dose intake of PAT caused acute kidney injury (AKI) in mice. We performed high-throughput transcriptional sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the treatment and control groups. The ferroptosis signaling pathway had the highest enrichment, suggesting ferroptosis is involved in PAT-induced AKI. Further, the existence of ferroptosis and autophagy was confirmed by observing the changes of mitochondria morphology and the formation of autophagosomes by electron microscopy. And the expression of solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), p62, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 (NCOA4), and ferritin heavy chain 1 (FTH1) were downregulated, whereas acyl-CoA synthase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), transferrin (TF), LC3, and ferritin light chain (FTL) expression were upregulated in PAT-exposed mice. These results suggested autophagy-dependent ferroptosis occurred in the animal model. This view has also been confirmed in the human renal tubular epithelial cell (HKC) experiments. Autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3MA) attenuated PAT-induced ferroptosis and the iron contents in HKC cells. Simultaneous autophagy-dependent ferroptosis can be inhibited by ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) and desferrioxamine (DFO). In general, this study provides a new perspective for exploring the new mechanism of acute kidney injury caused by PAT.										2022	70	20	6213	6223	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08349					FSTA:2022-10-Cd3269

European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					The phospholipid molecular species (PMS) in the muscular tissue of the swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) are extracted and quantified using aminopropyl coated silica-based solid-phase extraction (SPE) and hydrophilic interaction chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS), respectively. Once the lipidomics profile is acquired, the contents of PMS are semiquantitatively determined using linear regression models. It is found that in swimming crab, phosphatidylcholine (PC, 14.30 mg g-1) is the most abundant phospholipid class, followed by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 8.20 mg g-1), phosphatidylinositol (PI, 1.60 mg g-1), and phosphatidylserine (PS, 9.83 mg g-1). The nutritional eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid structured phospholipids exist in swimming crabs, such as PC 18:0/20:5, PE 18:1/20:5 and 16:0/22:6, PI 18:0/20:5. Besides, plasmalogens are detected, such as PC o-16:0/22:6 and PE o-18:0/20:5. Finally, this method is validated to be efficient and accurate in terms of linearity (correlation coefficients, R2 0.9976 to 0.9993), sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD, 0.22-0.33 g mL-1), precision (relative standard deviation, RSDintra-day≤4.11%), and recovery (78% to 85%, RSD≤5.79%). In conclusion, swimming crab is rich in health-beneficial phospholipids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid and/or docosahexaenoic acid structured phospholipids and plasmalogens, and the muscular tissue is proved to be of high nutritional value.

Food Control					Microwave-assisted induction heating (MAIH) is an emerging thermal processing technology that combines microwave and induction heating to provide rapid and even heating of food. A research found that the optimum MAIH cooking temperature for hard clams was 130°C for 110 s or 90°C for 130 s. The purpose of this work was to investigate whether MAIH could delay or not the loss of quality and prolong the shelf life of clams. Fresh clams were heated via MAIH to 130°C for 110 s and to 90°C for 130 s, respectively, and compared to the traditional boiling method of 90°C for 150 s. Cooked clams were stored at 4°C for 30 days to determine changes in microbiological quality and physicochemical properties. The results showed the undetectable aerobic plate count (APC) and psychrotrophic bacteria count (PBC) in the samples when heated via MAIH for the first 20 days of storage; thereafter, the counts increased gradually. By the end of the storage period, the final counts were approximately 4.0 log CFU/g. The initial APC and PBC in the sample heated with boiled water were at approximately 3.20 log CFU/g, which then increased over time to reach 7.66 log CFU/g and 8.06 log CFU/g, respectively, by the end of the storage period. After 30 days of storage, the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) in the MAIH-treated samples was significantly lower than that in the water-boiled samples, by less than 36mg/100g. In terms of color, the lightness (L*) and whiteness (W) of all samples decreased gradually, while the redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) increased. In terms of texture, the MAIH-treated samples retained greater hardness, cohesiveness, and chewiness than the water-boiled samples (p< 0.05). Based on the above findings, compared to the traditional heating method of water boiling, the treatment of clam samples with MAIH retarded the degradation of texture, and inhibited the increase of TVBN and the growth of microorganisms during refrigerated storage. Thus, MAIH processing can prolong the storage life of the heat-treated clams from 10 days (when treated with boiling water) to 30 days at 4°C.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Microwave-assisted induction heating (MAIH) is a complex heating process characterized by rapid and uniform heating based on a combination of microwave heating (power: 1000 W; frequency: 2450 MHz) applied from above and electromagnetic induction heating (power: 1500 W) applied from below. In this study, we assessed the utility of MAIH in processing the flesh of barramundi (Lates calcarifer), an important aquaculture species in Asian countries. To determine the effects of different heating conditions on the microbial contamination and physicochemical qualities of barramundi meat, fresh barramundi meats (100 g) were sealed in heat-resistant crystallized polyethylene terephthalate containers containing 150 mL of saline solution, and were subsequently heated in MAIH to 90°C or 70°C and held to different time. The results revealed that in response to an increase in the duration of heating, there were reductions in the aerobic plate count, psychrotrophic bacteria count, hydrogen sulphide-producing bacteria count, and coliform count, along with lower contents of total volatile basic nitrogen, in treated samples. Conversely, with a prolongation of the time exposed to heat, we detected increases in the L* (lightness), W (whiteness), DeltaE(colour difference), and texture (hardness and chewiness) of fish meat, whereas there was a reduction of a* (redness). When the samples were heated for at least 110 s to 90°C or for at least 130 s to 70°C, the barramundi meats obtained appeared to be fully cooked with microbial counts below the limits of detection. In addition, under both heating conditions, thermal imaging revealed a uniform distribution of temperature within treated samples. Furthermore, monitoring of temperature profiles at central points in fish samples revealed that maximum temperatures of 97°C and 79°C were reached in response to MAIH processing at 90°C for 110 s and 70°C for 130 s, respectively. Thus, on the basis of the quality considerations of appearance, microbial count, and texture, the recommended optimal heating conditions for barramundi meats produced using MAIH are 90°C for 110 s and 70°C for 130 s. Industrial relevance. The MAIH equipment is a novel thermal processing technology and allows food to be heated and pasteurized simultaneously after the package is sealed, eliminates issues of secondary contamination due to the need for subsequent packaging, and extends the shelf life. MAIH technology, therefore, serves as a viable future alternative for thermal processing of manufacturing refrigerated ready-to-eat seafood.

J		Yung-Hsiang Tsai; Hsien-Feng Kung; Chung-Saint Lin; Ching-Yu Hsieh; Tsung-Yin Ou; Tien-Hsiang Chang; Yi-Chen Lee							Impacts of high-pressure processing on quality and shelf-life of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) stored at 4°C and 15°C.		International Journal of Food Properties					The objective of this work was to study the application of high-pressure processing (HPP) on the quality change and extending the shelf-life of yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) stored at low temperature. The effects of HPP treatments (200, 300, 400, 500, and 600 MPa for 5 min) on microbiological and chemical quality, and histamine content of tuna flesh stored at 4°C and 15°C, respectively, were evaluated. With the increased pressure, the levels of aerobic plate count (APC) and coliform in tuna flesh significantly decreased. It was also found that the L* (lightness), b* (yellowness), W (whiteness), DeltaE (color difference), and texture (hardness, cohesiveness and chewiness) of fish flesh increased significantly with the increased pressure; however, a* (redness) value decreased. Furthermore, HPP with a pressure of >300 MPa on tuna samples significantly delayed the increase in APC during storage at 4°C or 15°C, respectively, while the samples pressurized more than 200 MPa had significantly lower levels of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and histamine compared to the control samples during storage. The results indicated that tuna flesh pressurized at least 300 MPa for 5 min could be a technique employed to extend the shelf-life to 1 d at 15°C and 6 d at 4°C, based on the APC limit standard (6.47 log CFU/g). In this study, HPP can be seen as a potential useful technique to preserve tuna flesh due to its ability to reduce bacterial load and retard TVBN and histamine production. © 2022 Yung-Hsiang Tsai, HsienFeng Kung, Chung-Saint Lin, Ching-Yu Hsieh, Tsung-Yin Ou, Tien-Hsiang Chang and YiChen Lee.										2022	25	1	237	251	1094-2912				10.1080/10942912.2022.2029483					FSTA:2023-03-Rc1497

Chang; Yi-Chen Lee							Combined effect of brine salting and high-hydrostatic-pressure processing to improve the microbial quality and physicochemical properties of milkfish fillet.		International Journal of Food Properties					The effects of soaking milkfish fillet in 3% or 9% NaCl brines for 90min at 4°C, and followed by processing with varying hydrostatic pressures (300, 400, 500, and 600 MPa) for 5min on microbial quality and physicochemical properties were evaluated. After brine salting, the color of the fillet, the L* (lightness), W (whiteness), and DeltaE (color difference) values increased with the increases in pressure, whereas the a* (redness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased, indicating that the fillet became brighter and whiter. Among them, 3% brine salting combined with pressures of 300 and 400 MPa groups had higher redness (a* value) and lower DeltaE value compared to the higher pressure groups. Regarding the texture of the fillet, the hardness and chewiness of unsalted fish were significantly higher than that of brine salted fish under the same pressure, whereas the cohesiveness of the unsalted fillet was significantly lower than that of brine salted fillet. The results indicates that brine salting could make the instrumental texture of fish softer, which can compensate for the disadvantages of increased hardness and chewiness of the fillet caused by high-pressure processing. Brine salting combined with high pressure produced a significantly reducing effect on aerobic plate count (APC), psychrotrophic bacteria count (PBC), and total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) values of the fish as compared with that by brine salting or high pressure alone. Therefore, brine salting at a proper brine concentration (3%) and followed by high-pressure processing at 300 or 400 MPa for 5min can improve or maintain a relatively good color and texture, as well as result in a synergistic bactericidal effect.

Journal of Functional Foods					Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome. Genkwanin is a nonglycosylated flavonoid that has several biopharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and immunomodulator effects. This study investigated the protective effect and mechanism of genkwanin in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model. Histopathological analysis indicated that genkwanin had a potential ameliorative effect on LPS-induced ALI. Genkwanin also inhibited several pathogenic features induced by LPS, including lung oedema, alveolar-capillary barrier dysfunction, and leukocyte and neutrophil infiltration. In addition, it inhibited NF-kappaB pathway activation, including phosphorylation of p65 and degradation of IkappaB, induced by LPS. Genkwanin also inhibited the phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK pathway induced by LPS, although it did not inhibit the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases or c-Jun N-terminal kinases induced by LPS. In conclusion, our results indicate that genkwanin has a protective effect against LPS-induced ALI that it exerts by inhibiting NF-kappaB pathway activation and p38 MAPK phosphorylation.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanism of a specific probiotic strain on suppression of adipogenesis and inflammatory response in white adipose tissue (WAT) of high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Methods and Results. Eight strains are screened in vitro for candidates of potential probiotics. Lactobacillus rhamnosus LRH05 (LRH05) and Lactobacillus reuteri LR47 (LR47) are screened out with lower triglyceride expression in vitro. The mice are fed a control diet (CD), HFD, or HFD supplemented with a dose of LRH05 or LR47 at 109 CFU per mouse per day for 10 weeks (n=8), respectively. The results demonstrate that LRH05, but not LR47, significantly reduce body weight gain and the weight of WAT, as well as improve hepatic steatosis and glucose intolerance. LRH05 regulates the Mogat1, Igf-1, Mcp-1, and F4/80 mRNA expression and decreases macrophage infiltration in WAT. LRH05 shows an increase in butyric and propionic acid-producing bacteria, including Lachnoclostridium, Romboutsia, and Fusobacterium that is coincident with the increased fecal propionic acid and butyric acid levels. Conclusion. LRH05 shows a strain-specific effect on ameliorating the pro-inflammatory process by reducing inflammatory macrophage infiltration and the expression of inflammation-related genes in mice. Thus, LRH05 can be considered a potential probiotic strain to prevent obesity. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	1			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100348					FSTA:2022-04-Ad6428

Xiongling							Multifaceted functionality of L-arginine in modulating the emulsifying properties of pea protein isolate and the oxidation stability of its emulsions.		Food & Function					The effects of l-arginine (Arg) at different concentrations (0%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.5% and 1.0%) on the antioxidant activity, structure and emulsifying properties of pea protein isolate (PPI) were explored. The intrinsic mechanisms of the reactions at different concentrations were specifically examined. With an increase in Arg concentration, the scavenging activities of ABTS+. and .OH and the Fe2+ chelating activity of PPI increased significantly (P< 0.05). The addition of Arg (0%-0.2%) significantly modified the PPI structure, causing an increase in protein solubility (from 66.2% to 79.0%) and a decrease in protein particle size (from 682 nm to 361 nm) (P< 0.05). In addition, treatment with Arg (0%-0.2%) effectively improved the emulsifying activity of PPI (by 28%), decreased the droplet size and viscosity of the emulsion, and enhanced the physical and oxidation stabilities of the emulsion. The increase in interfacial protein content and the absolute value of zeta-potential, and the microscopy images also showed that 0%-0.2% Arg treatment helped in forming a uniform and stable microemulsion. In contrast, a high concentration (0.5%-1.0%) of Arg diminished its positive effect on the emulsifying properties of PPI. Therefore, treatment with an appropriate concentration of Arg can significantly improve the emulsifying activity of PPI and enhance the stability of the emulsions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1336	1347	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03372g					FSTA:2022-06-Gg2523
J		Yungang Cao; Xinrui Han; Fang Yuan; Xin Fan; Miaomiao Liu; Li Feng; Zhaorui Li; Junrong Huang							Effect of combined treatment of L-arginine and transglutaminase on the gelation behavior of freeze-damaged myofibrillar protein.		Food & Function					This research focused on the effects of l-arginine (Arg, 5 mM), transglutaminase (TG, E: S=1:500), and the combination (Arg+ TG) on the physicochemical properties and heat-induced gel performance of freeze-damaged myofibrillar protein (MP). The incorporation of Arg decreased the alpha-helix percentage (48.4%) and the mean particle size of freeze-damaged MP, as well as cooking loss (46.5%) and the overall textural characteristics of MP gels. The addition of TG reduced the alpha-helix content by 10.7% but significantly enhanced the crosslinking and heat-induced gel behavior of freeze-damaged MP, resulting in a slight reduction of cooking loss (17.7%) and the most ideal textural properties of MP gels. Although the presence of Arg remarkably suppressed the heat-induced development of storage modulus (G′) and reduced the hardness of MP gels (by 13.4%), the combination (Arg+ TG) showed the lower cooking loss and the improved textural characteristics, with the set gel displaying the most delicate and compact microstructure. These findings indicated that the combination of Arg and TG could be a potential strategy to enhance the gelling performance of freeze-damaged meat proteins. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1495	1505	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03691b					FSTA:2022-06-Sa2698

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Protein oxidation, a common quality deterioration in muscle foods, could change the physicochemical characteristics and processability of the meat proteins. The present study focused on the effects of sodium pyrophosphate (PP, 1 mM), Lysine (Lys, 5 mM) and their combination (1 mM PP+5 mM Lys) on the changes in structure and gelling properties of oxidized myofibrillar protein (Ox-MP). Treatment with the additives modified protein structures, reduced the average particle diameter (d3,2 and d4,3), restored the gelling behavior of Ox-MP, and remarkably improved the water holding capacity and breaking strength of heat-induced protein gels. The combination of PP and Lys showed a synergistic effect and resulted in the optimal enhancement of Ox-MP gel properties. Specifically, the set gel exhibited a fine, homogeneous and compact microstructure and a breaking strength 4-fold that of Ox-MP. Therefore, a combination of PP and Lys is recommended for aerated meat processing to maintain or enhance the MP gelling potential.

J		Yunge Liu; Yimin Zhang; Lixian Zhu; Lebao Niu; Xin Luo; Pengcheng Dong							The acid tolerance responses of the Salmonella strains isolated from beef processing plants.		Food Microbiology					The development of the stationary-phase, low-pH-inducible acid tolerance response (ATR) in the Salmonella contaminant of beef during the processing arises food safety concerns, because it may evoke bacterial coping mechanisms against bactericidal insults and alter gene expression that contribute to pathogen virulence. However, information on the development of the ATR and the stability (defined as the capacity to maintain the acquired acid tolerance after induction) in the Salmonella during the production and distribution of beef is limited. After adaptation overnight, ATRs in the 79 strains of Salmonella isolated from beef processing plants were investigated by comparing the log reduction in the 2-h acid challenge trials at pH 3.0. Six representative strains were selected to further estimate the effect of three factors in the incubation period on the development of the ATR, including adapted pH values (5.0, 5.4, 6.0, and 7.0), temperatures (10 °C and 37 °C), and the adaptation media (meat extract and brain heart infusion media). The stability of acid tolerance during the long-time chilled storage (4 °C for 13 days) was also observed on two strains of serotypes S. Derby and S. Meleagridis. All the strains isolated from beef processing plants exhibited an enhanced acid tolerance indicating the widespread existence of ATR. The results also revealed that strain variability was present in the development of ATR. Significant tolerance to lethal acidic environments (pH 3.0) was found when the Salmonella strains had been acid-adapted in meat extract at pH 5.0, pH 5.4, or pH 6.0, which indicated the possible induction of ATR during beef production. After the acid adaptations, the population reduction after the acid challenge (BHI, pH = 3) in the strains was significantly lower than the non-induced at the 1d, 7 day and 13 day's storage in meat extract media at 4 °C, which revealed the persistence of ATR during beef distribution. Compared to 37 °C, adaptation in lower temperature (10 °C) significantly reduced the ATR and no ATR was developed when adapted in 4 °C. This emphasizes the importance of keeping a low temperature of beef throughout the supply chains of beef industry.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The biofilm of Salmonellais a major source of meat contamination and disease transmission. This study aimed to investigate biofilm inhibitory effects and mechanisms of clove essential oil (CEO) and oregano essential oil (OEO) at different concentrations on SalmonellaDerby (S. Derby). Crystal violet staining assay was employed to investigate the anti-biofilm effects of the essential oils (EOs), and the initial adhesion, bacterial metabolism, extracellular polymer (EPS) and microscopic examination were used to explore the inhibition mechanism. The results showed that EOs at minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) significantly inhibited the biofilm formation of S. Derby. At 1/8 MIC, the two EOs had no significant inhibitory effect on the growth of S. Derby planktonic bacteria, but the biofilm inhibition rates of CEO and OEO were 90.29% and 48.79%, respectively. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) analysis also confirmed distinguishable anti-biofilm effects of CEO and OEO. In addition, our results showed that CEO and OEO inhibited S. Derby biofilm formation by inhibiting metabolic activity and EPS production. This work provides a theoretical basis for the future mechanism research of EOs in the control of biofilm formation of S. Derby and supports the potential application of CEO and OEO in the food industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	162				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2022.113486					FSTA:2022-09-Sg4828

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Candida etchellsii is a predominant strain in Chinese horse bean-chili-paste, a famous and traditional condiment with high salt content. In this study, physiological properties, ester production capacity and gene expression of C. etchellsii under salt stress were investigated, and the results showed that the strain evoked miscellaneous regulations to resist high salt stress. Under salt stress, C. etchellsii would accumulate intracellular glycerol, Na+ and K+ to balance osmotic pressure. Interestingly, the strain showed much stronger capacity to yield ethyl hexanoate and hexyl acetate after 5% and 20% (w/v) NaCl treatment whether in esterification or alcoholysis system. Furthermore, transcriptome data indicated that the genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism had significantly different expression, and their regulations were consistent with the results of physiological analysis. The results obtained in this study could contribute to understand the salt tolerance mechanism of C. etchellsii and provide a theoretical support for its application in traditional food fermentation.

J		Yunhe Zhang; Bo Shan; Jiashun Gong; Yongjin Hu							Mechanism of biogenic amine synthesis of Enterococcus faecium isolated from Sanchun ham.		Food Science & Nutrition					Sanchuan ham, produced in Yunnan, China, is food with ethnic characteristics favored by consumers. However, it can contain biogenic amines such as tyramine that are harmful to health, and the synthesis mechanism of biogenic amines in Sanchuan ham is not clear. This study focuses on the regulation of biogenic amine synthesis by quorum sensing. We used high-performance liquid chromatography to detect the content of biogenic amine in different kinds of ham and found that the content of biogenic amine in Sanchuan ham was higher than that in others. Tyramine-producing strain isolated from Sanchuan ham was identified as Enterococcus faecium. By monitoring the growth and tyramine synthesis of Enterococcus faecium under cultured conditions, the results found that high temperature and low salt increased tyramine production by E. faecium. After seven exogenous amino acids were applied to E. faecium, only tyrosine could promote the production of tyramine in E. faecium, and tyramine could not be synthesized in E. faecium until a certain amount was reached, indicating the presence of microbial quorum sensing signal molecules in the synthesis of tyramine in E. faecium. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of the differential metabolites produced by E. faecium showed that the contents of some peptides, especially alanyl-leucine, were significantly increased. Further experiments with synthetic alanyl-leucine illustrated that alanyl-leucine activated the expression of tyrosine decarboxylase (tyrDC), thereby regulating the synthesis of tyramine by E. faecium. Alanyl-leucine acted as quorum sensing signal molecules for biogenic amine synthesis by E. faecium, which provided a theoretical basis for reducing biogenic amine accumulation in ham. It is beneficial to control the content of biogenic amines in ham in the future. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Yunho Ji; Jangheon Han							Sustainable home meal replacement (HMR) consumption in Korea: exploring service strategies using a modified importance-performance analysis.		Foods					The COVID-19 pandemic has changed traditional consumer consumption behavior and requires a new service strategy to cope with sustainable consumption. Moreover, it is necessary to focus academic attention on consumer behavior to cook and eat more easily amid Korea's socioeconomic changes such as the increase in single-person households, aging, rising prices, and continuing economic recession. In this study, we used a revised importance-performance analysis (IPA) to identify specific measures to improve consumer satisfaction with home meal replacements (HMRs). An online survey of Korean adults who had purchased HMRs was conducted based on a convenience sampling method. According to the results, items that could be intensively improved were the "introduction of new dishes", "creation of various flavors", "cost-effectiveness", and "reasonable price", whereas "easy to prepare", "easily available", and "identified country of origin" received favorable assessments. With the growth of the non-face-to-face economy due to COVID-19, our findings suggest marketing strategies for sustainable HMR consumption. © 2022 by the authors.

Yellow-fleshed peach was treated by four methods, namely, nanomaterial packaging (NA), 1-MCP fumigation and nanomaterial packaging (1-MCP-NA), polyethylene (PE) packaging, and 1-MCP fumigation with polyethylene packaging (1-MCP-PE). Changes in the decay rate, firmness, browning index, soluble solid content, and titratable acid of the fruit were then measured at room temperature at 1, 4 and 10 days of storage. Thirty-two VOCs, including terpenoids, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, and ketones, were identified. Seventeen VOCs were found to be significant with predictive variable important in the projection (VIP) > 1 and p< 0.05 by analysis of variance and orthogonal projection to latent structure discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). After 10 days of storage, the browning index of 1-MCP-NA group was 51.7%, which was lower than the control fruit (PE, 76.7%). Compared with other three treatments, 1-MCP-NA showed the better ability to delay and inhibit decreases in ester and aldehyde contents, and the ethanol content was lowest in the samples treated by 1-MCP-NA during storage. Differences among treatment groups were distinguished by principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering heat map. The results showed that 1-MCP-NA could well maintain the quality and flavor stability of yellow-fleshed peach, and it had a good application prospect in the postharvest preservation of yellow-fleshed peach. Practical Application. In this study, 1-methylcyclopropylene (1-MCP) combined with nanomaterial (NA) packaging (1-MCP-NA) proved to have a better fresh preservation effect. 1-MCP-NA showed better ability to delay and inhibit decreases in ester and aldehyde contents by HS-GC-IMS technique. It provided a new strategy for postharvest storage of yellow-fleshed peaches. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	9	4009	4026	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16277					FSTA:2023-01-Jd0736

Food Chemistry					A fluorescent probe, Nap-MOR, based on the naphthalimide fluorophore, was designed and developed for pH measurement in aqueous solutions. Nap-MOR had a close linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and pH, in the range 4.5-8, which covers the full range of pH found in normal fresh, defective and spoiled meat. PH measurement with Nap-MOR was free from interference by a wide range of ions and biochemicals found in meat and the results were not significantly different in comparison with a pH meter. Therefore, Nap-MOR is a robust and convenient way to evaluate the freshness of chicken breast meat by measuring its pH.

Food Chemistry					An "off-on" fluorescent probe, Nap-DNB, which is based on naphthimide, was designed and developed for the detection of biological selenols in vitro. We have adopted a combination of a low-pH detection environment and reaction sites that are more difficult to destroy to avoid the interference of a large number of biological thiols in biological samples. Nap-DNB can completely respond to selenocysteine within 15 mins, with a detection limit of 92 nM. Nap-DNB was successfully used for the detection of selenols in the serum, liver, and longissimus dorsi of selenium-enriched Tan sheep. Through comparison, we found that the detection of selenols by the Nap-DNB is similar to that by thioredoxin reductase and glutathione peroxidase in a commercial kit method. Nap-DNB can be used for the detection of selenols in selenium-enriched Tan sheep.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. The development of atopic dermatitis (AD) in infants is closely related to the lagging development of intestinal microbiota, including that inoculated by breast milk bacteria, and immune development. Lactobacillus reuteri Fn041 is a secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA)-coated bacterium derived from human milk. Methods and Results. We intervene with L. reuteri Fn041 in maternal and offspring BALB/C mice during late gestation and lactation and after weaning of the pups, respectively. AD is then induced with MC903. L. reuteri Fn041 significantly suppresses AD symptoms such as skin swelling, mast cell, and eosinophil infiltration. This effect is attributed to the regulation of the systemic Th1 and Th2 cytokine ratios and the promotion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cell proliferation in mesenteric lymph nodes. It is also associated with the regulation of intestinal microbiota, particularly promoting Lactobacillus and Akkermansia. Conclusion. Our study strengthens the understanding that breast milk-derived sIgA coated potential probiotics are involved in the development of infant intestinal microbiota, thus promoting immune development and preventing allergic diseases, and expanding the knowledge of breast milk sIgA and bacterial interactions on infant immune development. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	6			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100699					FSTA:2022-07-Pe3085

Food Chemistry					Analysis of three matcha (cyclone-, bead- and stone-milled) revealed differences in their sizes and surface morphologies. Using liquid chromatography, 4 sugars, 6 organic acids, 18 amino acids and 9 polyphenols were detected in all matcha samples and shown to present in different amount. Moreover, 108 volatile compounds were detected and 30 potential flavour-contributing compounds were quantified by gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry using headspace-stir bar sorptive extraction-thin-film solid-phase microextraction (HS-SBSE-TFSPME). Sensory evaluation by a trained panel found that the matcha samples possess different notes (cyclone-milled: leafy; bead-milled: fishy; and stone-milled: roasty) which is supported by the volatile compound analysis. Finally, the three matcha were differentiated based on non-volatile and volatile components using principal component analysis, and the correlation between chemical composition and sensory evaluation data was carried out using partial least square regression. In conclusion, milling processes clearly affected the physical, chemical and sensory qualities of matcha.

Food Chemistry					Ampicillin (AMP) is commonly used to treat diseases caused by bacterial infections as a veterinary drug. However, the abuse of AMP can lead to residues in food and ultimately cause harm to humans. Thus, it is significant to construct a reliable system for AMP detection. Here, we developed an inner filter effect system based on a solid-phase capture probe and the catalysis of platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) for AMP determination in food. In the presence of AMP, PDMS captured AMP then combined with aptamer-functionalized PtNPs, which catalyzed the oxidation of 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine, resulting in upconversion fluorescence quenching. The results showed the fluorescence intensity of upconversion nanoparticles was related to AMP concentration (0.5-100 ng.mL-1) with an LOD of 0.32 ng.mL-1, which made quantification of AMP possible. The method also achieved a satisfactory recovery rate (96.89-112.92%) and can be used for AMP detection in food samples with selectivity and sensitivity.

Food Chemistry					Tetracycline, a broad-spectrum antibiotic, has been widely used in disease treatment and other fields. However, due to the unreasonable use, its residue remains in food which eventually harms human health. Here described an upconversion nanosensor for tetracycline detection based on magnetic separation and electrostatic adsorption. To identify tetracycline, tetracycline aptamer, and europium ions (Eu3+) were introduced in the system. According to the electrostatic adsorption principle, Eu3+ exposed core-shell UCNPs were bound to negative complex of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and aptamer. In the presence of tetracycline, UCNPs separated with MNPs-aptamer and remained in the supernatant by an external magnetic field. Under optimal conditions, the linear detection range of tetracycline was 0.5-1000 ng.mL-1, and the detection limit was 0.17 ng. mL-1. It has been successfully applied to detect tetracycline in food samples. The constructed method provided broad prospects for tetracycline detection with the merits of simple operation, high sensitivity, excellent repeatability, and selectivity.

M.; Haile Ma							Ultrasonic modification on fermentation characteristics of Bacillus varieties: impact on protease activity, peptide content and its correlation coefficient.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to investigate the regulative effects of low-intensity ultrasound on the biomass, protease activity, and peptide content of eight Bacillus strains upon casein as substrate. Protease expression types (constitutive and inducible) were evaluated among eight Bacillus strains based on casein and its hydrolysates media. During ultrasound-assisted fermentation (UAF) of casein with Bacillus varieties, B. amyloliquefaciens 20029 displayed the highest increment in protease activity (37.33%) and peptide content (21.63%). Under the optimal ultrasonic parameters (frequency of 40 kHz, power density of 30 W/L and duration of 15 min after cultivation for 4 h), the protease activity and peptide content from casein fermented with B. amyloliquefaciens 20029 increased by 50.00% and 45.00%, respectively, compared with the control. According to Person's correlation analysis, peptide content had a highly negative correlation (r = -0.77) with protease activity based on eight Bacillus strains, and the r value became -0.75 after extra-adding B. amyloliquefaciens 20029 based on UAF. The practical fermentation of soybean meal and corn gluten meal with B. amyloliquefaciens 20029 further confirmed that ultrasound effectively improved peptide contents by its inducible protease expression. This finding provided a vital reference for screening fermentation strains and substrate proteins during UAF.

Food & Function					This study explored the neuroprotective effect of the peptide LYLKPR derived from fermented yak milk by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum JLAU103 on H2O2-injured HT-22 cells. Peptide LYLKPR showed good stability in the simulated gastrointestinal tract and strong penetrating ability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in vitro. LYLKPR could activate the Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1 pathway, increase the activities of SOD and CAT, and reduce the levels of ROS and MDA in HT-22 cells. In addition, LYLKPR controlled the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by inhibiting the oxidative stress, ultimately preventing the cleavage of pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-1beta by caspase-1, and reducing the level of intracellular mature IL-18 by 29.08%. Based on the molecular docking verification, LYLKPR could effectively bind to the Keap-1 protein, and directly inhibit the inflammasome to significantly increase intracellular BDNF, synaptophysin, and PSD95, and protect synaptic function. Collectively, LYLKPR ameliorated oxidative stress-mediated neuronal injury by inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome via modulation of the Nrf2/Keap-1/HO-1 pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	23	12021	12038	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02131e					FSTA:2023-03-Pl1527

Food Science & Nutrition					As the national flower of Korea, the Hibiscus syriacus L. (Rose of Sharon) is symbolic in its abundance and is a prominent feature of Korean culture. H. syriacus has played an important role in Korea, not only as an ornamental plant but also as an essential ingredient in folk remedies through its various parts. This study aimed to characterize the nutritional and biochemical composition of each plant unit of H. syriacus "Wonhwa." The units are namely: the petals, leaves, roots, and sprouts from its seeds. According to the results each unit produced, the sprouts had the highest content of amino acids and fatty acids which adhere to the requirements of nutritionally excellent food ingredients. The petals produced high quantities of glucose, sucrose, and fumaric acid, with the highest antioxidant activity among the four units. The main bioactive compounds detected in H. syriacus extracts in the four units were o-coumaric acid, p-coumaric acid, schaftoside, isoschaftoside, apigenin-6-C-glucoside-7-o-glucoside, and kaempferol-3-O-galactoside-7-O-rhamnoside. Overall, the highest number of bioactive compounds, 2 phenolic acids and 22 flavonoids, were identified in the petals. These results suggest the possibility of excellent pharmacological activity in the petals. © 2022 The Authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The main purpose of this study is to find out how tea polyphenols affect the conformational, functional, and morphological characteristics of beef myofibrillar proteins (MPs). Polyphenols addition did not change amine group contents of MPs but caused a slightly increase in carbonyl groups of MPs at high level addition, and it can also decrease the sulfhydryl groups and induced the formation of disulfide bonds (S-S). The solubility, surface hydrophobicity and emulsion activity index of MPs were decreased by polyphenols, but the emulsion stability index did not change. Surface morphological analysis of MPs gels showed that polyphenols addition was harmful to the formation process of MPs gels but increased surface complexity of MPs gels. The degree of MPs aggregation was related to how much polyphenols were added to MPs suspension. Low ratio polyphenols caused a small fraction of MPs to aggregate and high ratio polyphenols resulted in excessive aggregation of MPs.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Interstitial cystitis (IC) is featured by apoptosis and chronic inflammation in bladder tissue. We aimed to evaluate the effect of echinacoside (ECH), which is known to modulate inflammation and apoptosis on IC using relevant models. We established a mouse model of cystitis using cyclophosphamide (CYP) and treated human urothelium cells (SV-HUC-1) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) + ATP as in vitro model. The bladder function was tested by urodynamics. Apoptosis of bladder cells was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling assay. Expressions of apoptosis-associated and inflammation-related proteins were assessed using western blotting. Treatment with ECH significantly improved bladder function, reduced inflammatory damage, and decreased apoptosis in the models. Furthermore, ECH decreased the phosphorylation levels of IkappaB and NF-kappaB(p65), and upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), which are related to apoptosis and inflammation in CYP-induced mouse cystitis. Moreover, ECH did not reduce apoptosis of urothelial cells after treatment with PPARgamma antagonist GW9662. Our findings suggest that ECH might have protective effect against IC in bladder and be mediated through modulation of the PPARgamma/NF-kappaB pathway.										2022	25	7	722	731	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0194					FSTA:2023-03-Aj5454

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, bamboo leaf extract concentrate was used as a curing liquid to delay the oxidation of bacon while having the unique fragrance combined with different proportions of bamboo poles and cypress [1:0 (A), 2:1 (B), 1:1 (C), and 0:1 (D)] for smoking. The results indicated that the oxidation degree and residual nitrite content of the four groups remained lower during the whole storage. As for flavor compounds before and after storage, the differences in group A were mainly in aldehydes, esters, and alcohols, in groups B and C were mainly in ketones, alcohols, and acids. While the differences in group D were mainly in hydrocarbons and phenolics, accompanied by heavier resin and smoky odor, as well as onefold main flavor compounds after storage. Based on the oxidation degree and the overall changes in flavor compounds, group A was considered as the best among the four groups. Practical applications. In this study, bamboo leaf extract concentrate was used as a curing liquid to delay the oxidation of bacon while having the unique fragrance combined with different proportions of bamboo poles and cypress for smoking. We aimed to study the flavor compounds and oxidation changes in different treatments.

Food Chemistry					Water loss is a key factor for the postharvest senescence of fruit. It has been reported that natural cuticular wax at high concentrations has better performance than commercial coating in water retention of fruit, which can prevent postharvest water loss without the accumulation of off-flavor. Here, we analyzed the correlation between epicuticular wax and postharvest water loss with 75 citrus varieties from a natural population. The water loss rate of the fruit was little influenced by the wax microstructure (stomata and wax crystal morphology), but strongly affected by epicuticular wax components. Further, C24 and C26 aliphatic aldehydes showed the greatest impact on fruit water loss rate, whose correlation coefficients reached -0.63 and -0.67, respectively. These two substances could significantly reduce the fruit water loss rate, indicating that they are potential natural additives to be used in the coating for citrus fruit water retention.

Food Hydrocolloids					Paper is an inherent hydrophilic material due to the hydroxyl groups contained in cellulose, which limits its applications in packaging materials. This study proposed a simple one-step method for preparing hydrophobic paper by introduction of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs) and hexadecyltrimethoxysilane (HDTMS). The surface chemistry and morphology of coated paper were studied in detail. The 2%ChNCs/HDTMS coated paper was highly hydrophobic with a water contact angle greater than 130°, mainly due to the low surface energy provided by HDTMS. Compared with uncoated paper, the hydrophobic paper's tensile strength and water vapor barrier were significantly improved due to the addition of ChNCs. Meanwhile, the hydrophobic paper showed excellent environmental tolerance and mechanical stability. The survival rate of L929 cells on the modified paper was more than 80% by CCK-8 assay, which proved that the nanocoating was safe. In addition, the obtained hydrophobic coated paper can hold water, cola, green tea, milk, coffee, and orange juice for a long time and can be used as a straw to absorb liquid. This work prepared high-performance and green hydrophobic paper, which exhibits wide applications in food packaging.

Food Hydrocolloids					The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of pH-shifting and oil inclusion on the textural properties of plant protein-based fermentation-induced gels resembling dairy yogurt in consistency. Gels were formed by pH12-treated or native mung bean protein (MBP) with or without emulsified coconut oil (3% w/v) and transglutaminase (0.1% w/w protein) during fermentation at 43°C for 8 h. Quinoa flour hydrolysate was used to modulate the MBP gel network. Creep-recovery and viscoelasticity (Gʹ/Gʹʹ) tests showed that gels prepared with pH12 treated MBP were less deformable and stiffer than native MBP gels. The pH12 treated MBP gels also exhibited superior hardness and water-holding capacity over the native MBP gels. Consistently, the pH12 gels displayed more compact and denser network structures, and oil emulsion droplets as well as transglutaminase further contributed to such packing effect. 1H-LF-NMR confirmed less mobility of bulk water in pH12 gels compared with native gels.

Food Chemistry					Histamine is the prime culprit of toxicity resulting from seafood consumption, whereas conventional detection methods are not convenient to meet the needs of rapid histamine analysis nowadays. Based on upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and inner filter effects (IFE), a novel ratiometric fluorescence nanosystem was developed for the efficient detection of histamine. Through pre-treatment with solid-phase extraction (SPE) and colorific azo coupling reaction of histamine, the fluorescence of UCNPs at 548 nm was quenched, while fluorescence at 664 nm was unchanged. Thus, ratiometric fluorescence I548/I664 was inversely proportional to histamine concentration at a wide range of 10-200mg/L. The detection limit was 7.34mg/L, one order of magnitude lower than that of the traditional colorimetric method (25mg/L). In addition, such a convenient and environment-friendly detection system was further employed to quantify the histamine in fish, shrimp, and shellfish samples, showing excellent application potential in seafood safety.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, the impacts of deacetylation degree and molecular weight on the rheological and adhesive properties of chitosan (CS) including shear viscosity, initial viscosity, and peel strength of tobacco leaves have been studied. The effect of different dissolution solvents such as acetic acid (HAC) and lactic acid (HL) on chitosan adhesives was also investigated. The results revealed that the adhesive properties increased first and then decreased with the increase of deacetylation degree, while chitosan with higher molecular weight showed higher initial adhesiveness and peel strength values. Chitosan sample III with a medium deacetylation degree of 80.5% showed the best adhesion properties with an excellent ability to reduce the total mold and yeast on the surface of tobacco leaves. Sample HL-CS-III showed a lower initial adhesiveness value but a higher peel strength value than sample HAC-CS-III due to its more viscous nature. Overall, chitosan showed great potential to be used as adhesives for cigar wrapping and other food applications. Novelty impact statement. The adhesive properties of chitosan molecules with different molecular weights and degrees of deacetylation values are compared. Chitosan with a larger molecular weight and medium deacetylation degree shows maximum initial adhesiveness and peel strength to tobacco leaf. Chitosan dissolved in lactic acid had a higher peel strength value and better mechanical resistance than acetic acid-dissolved chitosan adhesive. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	8			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16770					FSTA:2022-12-Fe2526

Food Research International					Pullulan-Jiuzao glutelin (JG) conjugates (PJCs) were prepared via Maillard reaction in this study. PJCs were prepared by optimizing pullulan to JG ratios (0.5:1, 1:1,2:1, and 4:1, expressed as PJC-0.5, PJC-1, PJC-2, and PJC-4, respectively) and reaction times (0-180min) at pH 7 and 11. The secondary structure changes of PJC compared to JG, potential conjugation sites between pullulan and JG, PJC emulsifying properties, in vitro antioxidant activities, and interaction with curcumin (CUR) were investigated. Among the four PJCs, PJC-2 obtained after 180min reaction at pH 11 and 90°C exhibited the best ability in nano-emulsion stabilization with the lowest particle size (180-200 nm and 290-450 nm against NaCl during storage), PDI (0.2-0.4 and 0.4-0.7 against NaCl during storage), highest zeta-potential (-20.10mV), and lowest backscattering intensity. The spontaneous conjugation binding sites between pullulan and JG were Arg-39, Arg-54, and Asp-168. In contrast to native JG, PJC-2 exhibited better antioxidant capacities, low toxicity for CCD 841 CON and Caco-2 cells, and enhancement of antioxidant enzyme content (i.e., SOD, GPX, and CAT) after AAPH-induced oxidative stress.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The formation of soluble complexes between whey proteins and polysaccharides has potentially useful applications in the beverage industry. In this study, auricularia auricula polysaccharides (AP) and A. auricula extract (EAA) were prepared and their complexation behavior with whey protein isolate (WPI) was studied at pH 4.7 in order to ensure protein dispersal and avoid precipitation to achieve enhanced WPI stability. Both AP and EAA enhanced stability of 2%-4% WPI via the formation of complexes. WPI-AP and WPI-EAA solutions exhibited characteristics resembling steady pseudoplastic fluid. Heat treatment further resulted in altered structures of formed complexes which improved stability. Sensory evaluation by electronic tongue indicated that AP and EAA could relieve astringency of the WPI solution induced in acidic pH. This study provided the theoretical basis and demonstrated the potential application of a novel WPI-enriched beverage. Practical applications. Functional auricularia auricula polysaccharides and an A. auricula extract were shown to enhance stability of high concentrated whey protein isolate solutions. In this study, a potential commercially exploitable healthy beverage was developed. Furthermore, the foundation for its production is provided, which does not involve polysaccharide extraction steps thereby preserving the nutritional value of polysaccharide-rich ingredients. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16340					FSTA:2022-07-Hs6127

Food Chemistry					Tibetan tea is not only a national product of geographical identity, but also a traditional beverage inherits Chinese tradition. This study evaluated the metabolic profiles and biological activity in four Tibetan teas. 83 non-volatile metabolites were identified as differentially expressed metabolites, including amino acids and their derivatives, phenolic acids, flavonoids, nucleotides and their derivatives, terpenes, alkaloids, organic acids, lipids and others. CC and 131 were rich in terpenoids and lipids. MZ contained the highest contents of amino acids and their derivatives, phenolic acids and flavonoids. 26 key volatile compounds were considered as odor-active compounds. MZ showed the highest level of antioxidant and hypoglycemic activity . Statistics analysis indicated that polyphenols, flavonoids and catechins were significantly correlated (| r| ≥ 0.7, P< 0.05) with biological activities. This study indicated significant differences in the metabolic profiles of various types of Tibetan tea, which provided a clear database for quality detection of Tibetan tea.

J		Yuntao Wang; Shasha Wang; Rui Li; Yingjuan Wang; Qisen Xiang; Ke Li; Yanhong Bai							Effects of combined treatment with ultrasound and pH shifting on foaming properties of chickpea protein isolate.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, the foaming properties of chickpea protein isolate (CPI) subjected to different pH shifting treatment were investigated. It was found that the foaming ability (FA) of CPI, CPI subjected to treatment with pH shifting at pH 2 and pH 12 (CPI2 and CPI12), CPI subjected to combined treatment of ultrasound with pH shifting at pH 2 and pH 12 (CPI2-U and CPI12-U) were 81.1%, 180%, 225.5%, 212.1%, and 263.3%, respectively, while the foaming stability (FS) of these CPI did not change significantly. These results indicated that pH shifting under extreme acid or alkaline pH condition significantly enhanced the foaming properties of CPI, while the use of ultrasound further intensify this change. The best foaming properties of CPI12-U was ascribed to its smallest particle size, zeta potential, interfacial tension, the largest solubility and surface hydrophobicity. Besides, the free sulfhydryl content of CPI subjected to these treatments increased significantly, facilitating their adsorption to the air-liquid interface. Moreover, the increased content of alpha-helixes for CPI subjected to these treatments contributed to the formation of more stable interfaces. So this study provided a convenient means to significantly improve the foaming properties of CPI.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In recent years, emulsions stabilized by natural substances have attracted great interests of scientists. As both the emulsifying properties of chitosan (CH) and corn fiber gum (CFG) are poor, the different complex of CH and CFG were used to stabilize emulsion. It was found that the CH-CFG complex had significantly better emulsifying properties than CH or CFG at the same concentration, indicating they played a synergistic role in stabilizing oil in water emulsion. Cryo-SEM results showed that the CH-CFG complex formed a dense interfacial film on the surface of the oil droplets, forming a barrier that effectively prevented the flocculation of droplets, thus improving the stability of the emulsion. The changed surface zeta potential, interfacial activity and viscosity of CH-CFG complex compared with CH or CFG due to the interaction of CH and CFG contributed to the improved emulsifying properties of CH-CFG complex.

Food Chemistry					To explore the nutritional values of meat and meat analogues, the in vitro protein digestion of pork, beef, plant-based pork and beef were evaluated. In the gastric phase, the digestibility of pork was significantly higher than that of the plant-based pork, while the value of beef was lower than that of the plant-based beef. In the intestinal phase, both pork and beef showed higher digestibility than plant-based meat analogues. A greater number of small molecular peptides were identified from pork and beef than from plant-based meat after gastrointestinal digestion. Larger quantities of potential bioactive peptides were released from the meat than from the plant-based meat analogues during digestion. These differences were closely related to protein secondary structure, the formation of disulfide bonds and apparent viscosity of digestion solution. The findings give a new insight into the underlying mechanisms of the different phenotype responses of consumers to meat and plant-based meat.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Real meat and plant-based meat analogues have different in vitro protein digestibility properties. This study aims to further explore their in vivo digestion and absorption and their effects on the gastrointestinal digestive function of mice. Compared with the real pork and beef, plant-based meat analogues significantly reduced the number of gastric parietal cells, the levels of gastrin/CCKBR, acetylcholine/AchR, Ca2+, CAMK II, PKC, and PKA, the activity of H+, K+-ATPase, and pepsin, the duodenal villus height, and the ratio of villus height to crypt depth and downregulated the expression of most nitrogen nutrient sensors. Peptidomics revealed that plant-based meat analogues released fewer peptides during in vivo digestion and increased the host- and microbial-derived peptides. Moreover, the real beef showed better absorption properties. These results suggested that plant-based meat analogues weaken gastrointestinal digestive function of mice, and their digestion and absorption performance in vivo is not as good as the real meat.										2022	70	39	12442	12455	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04246					FSTA:2023-02-Sa0887

Punthakey							Contrasting responses to soil and water salinity in stomata and canopy traits produced convergence of water-use in tomatoes (Solanum esculentum) and okra (Abelmoschus esculentus): application to water management.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Salinity constrains agricultural sustainability and crops differ in their response. We tested the hypothesis that contrasting responses in canopy and stomatal traits to salinity will cause convergence of water-use in okra and tomato. Results. Stomata were found almost exclusively (>90%) on the lower leaf surface of tomato, but okra produced ~30% of stomata on the upper leaf surface. While salinity reduced the magnitudes of canopy and stomata traits in tomato, stomata traits were either unaffected or enhanced in okra. Salinity reduced the rates and duration of stomatal conductance (gs) in both crops, more severely in tomato, in which gs was restricted to early mornings in contrast to its bell-shape trend in okra. The superiority of okra in its stomata traits was compensated by the larger plant canopies in tomato, resulting in both daytime canopy transpiration and total plant water-use within 17% and 28%, respectively, of each other for the two crops. A tight stomatal control of transpiration that minimised use of water and its uptake from the soil conferred a superior salinity tolerance on tomato over okra. In both crops, stomata density (D) was inversely correlated with stomata area (A), while water-use was positively correlated with plant leaf area, in addition to D and A in tomato; gs was also correlated with stomata area index in tomato. Conclusion. Differences in water-use for both crops were relatively narrow, despite the several-fold differences in their canopy and stomata traits. Under saline conditions, irrigation intervals should be long for tomato but short for okra. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Yunwei Lin; Wenting Yin; Yujie Li; Guoqin Liu							Influence of different solid lipids on the properties of a novel nanostructured lipid carrier containing Antarctic krill oil.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effect of solid lipids (lauric acid (LAU), myristic acid (MYR), stearic acid (STE), glycerol monostearate (GMS), glycerol 1,3-distearate (GDS), glycerol tristearate (GTS), glycerol trimyristate (GTM) and glycerol trilaurate (GTL)) on the characteristics of novel nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) containing Antarctic krill oil through ultrasound. The fatty acids (LAU, MYR, STE and GMS) were unsuitable solid lipid materials, as apparent stratification was quickly observed during the NLC preparation. NLCs were successfully prepared using GTS, GTM, GTL and GDS. The zeta potential of all NLCs exceeded -30mV indicating good uniformity and stability. These NLCs appeared spherical or oval. Differential calorimetry and X-ray diffraction analysis revealed these NLCs formed imperfect crystals. As the carbon chain length of triglycerides increased from C12to C18, the particle size of NLCs increased from 235.8 2.3nm to 340.5 2.2nm, the degree of recrystallisation increased from 39.06% to 49.99%, while the EPA encapsulation efficiency decreased from 88.72 0.47% to 72.86 1.06%. NLC prepared with GDS had the smallest particle size (112.4 0.4nm), the lowest recrystallisation and the highest EPA encapsulation efficiency (>99%). GDS was the most suitable to prepare high encapsulate efficiency krill oil-loaded NLC. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	5	2886	2895	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15588					FSTA:2022-08-Ne1724
J		Yunxia Gong; Naranzul Tumurbaatar; Junying Zhou; Xiaobao Qi							A strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with high production of butanol.		European Food Research and Technology					The paper was aimed to isolate a strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with higher alcohol, butanol. 32 strains of S. cerevisiae were isolated and identified from the dough starters from different regions. First, sterile flour solution (SFS) was developed as a substrate, and the HS-SPME-GC/MS technique was used to detect the volatile compounds, especially butanol. Then, gas production rate and acid-producing efficacy of S. cerevisiae were detected by Wickerham's method and pH meter for assessing the ability to metabolize different sugar, respectively. Finally, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed to determine the genetic relationships among the strains. As a result, the SC-X1 obtained the highest concentration of butanol by metabolizing SFS, and the SC-N1 produced the richest variety of flavors during fermentation. The SC-X1 had a better acid-producing ability, it metabolized glucose, sucrose and maltose to produce acid which lower the pH value by 2.26, 2.17 and 1.46, respectively. The SC-X1 had higher gas-producing efficiency by utilizing glucose and sucrose, and the SC-N1 had perfect performance in gas-producing. The PFGE similarity coefficient was high in relationship with the S. cerevisiae resource. Through comprehensive analysis, SC-X1 and SC-N1 were chosen for further research due to their excellent chemical and microbiological performances. Especially, the SC-X1 is very potential for commercial usage with high production of butanol. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	248	1	207	217	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03874-z					FSTA:2022-04-Mq2376
J		Yunxia Li; Changyu Zhou; Jun He; Zhen Wu; Yangying Sun; Daodong Pan; Hongwei Tian; Qiang Xia							Combining e-beam irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging as a preservation strategy to improve physicochemical and microbiological properties of sauced duck product.		Food Control					The combined effects of electron-beam (e-beam) irradiation and modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on the physicochemical and quality characteristics of sauced duck were evaluated, with particular focus on the correlation between physicochemical parameters and spoilage bacterial community under different treatment conditions. The effects of irradiation doses (0-6 kGy) and gas composition were firstly assessed, demonstrating that 4 kGy irradiation under the atmosphere of 40% CO2/60% N2 significantly inhibited spoilage microbes and prolonged the shelf-life. The application of e-beam irradiation in combination with MAP obtained better sensory scores, fewer biogenic amine, and efficiently reduced the increase in total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and lipid oxidation during chilled storage, compared with the untreated and e-beam/MAP individually treated samples. Additionally, MAP and e-beam had a significant effect on bacterial succession, particularly the dominant microbiota largely contributing to the spoilage of the sauced duck product at the end of storage. The results of high-throughput sequencing demonstrated that Weissella spp. was the dominant genera for the samples packed with air and 40% CO2/60% N2, whereas Psychrobacter spp . became the most predominant genera in e-beam treated samples due to the resistance of Psychrobacter spp . to e-beam irradiation. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that physicochemical factors (TVB-N, TBARS and biogenic amines) were significantly correlated with spoilage microbial community. In particular, there was a significant positive correlation of putrescine with Weissella spp. and also a positive correlation of TBARS and putrescine with Psychrobacter spp. Multivariate analysis further validated the correlations between the spoilage-related indicators and microbes, as revealed by the involvement of Weissella and Psychrobacter in the formation of biogenic amines and TBARS. This investigation suggested that the combination of e-beam irradiation and MAP is a promising strategy to enhance the microbial safety and extend the shelf life of sauced duck.

Foods					More than 2 billion people worldwide are under threat of nutritional deficiency. Thus, an in-depth comprehension of the nutritional composition of staple crops and popular fruits is essential for health. Herein, we performed LC-MS-based non-targeted and targeted metabolome analyses with crops (including wheat, rice, and corn) and fruits (including grape, banana, and mango). We detected a total of 2631 compounds by using non-targeted strategy and identified more than 260 nutrients. Our work discovered species-dependent accumulation of common present nutrients in crops and fruits. Although rice and wheat lack vitamins and amino acids, sweet corn was rich in most amino acids and vitamins. Among the three fruits, mango had more vitamins and amino acids than grape and banana. Grape and banana provided sufficient 5-methyltetrahydrofolate and vitamin B6, respectively. Moreover, rice and grape had a high content of flavonoids. In addition, the three crops contained more lipids than fruits. Furthermore, we also identified species-specific metabolites. The crops yielded 11 specific metabolites, including flavonoids, lipids, and others. Meanwhile, most fruit-specific nutrients were flavonoids. Our work discovered the complementary pattern of essential nutrients in crops and fruits, which provides metabolomic evidence for a healthy diet. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Improper disposal of stevia residue causes environmental pollution and waste of resources. The extract of stevia residue is rich in chlorogenic acid and isochlorogenic acids, and has a great potential in livestock and poultry breeding. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary stevia residue extract (SRE) supplementation on the performance, meat quality, antioxidative capacity and gut microbiota in growing-finishing pigs. Results. The results showed that increasing the concentration of SRE supplementation linearly increased (P<0.05) body weight from day 1 to 35. Supplementation with SRE significantly increased (P<0.05) average daily gain (ADG) from day 1 to 75.100mg kg-1 SRE supplementation significantly increased (P<0.05) hot carcass weight and gastric index. Moreover, increasing the concentration of SRE linearly increased (P<0.05) the score of appearance of longissimus thoracis, as well as serum albumin, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content. Further study found that increasing the concentration of SRE linearly increased (P<0.05) serum total superoxide dismutase activity, and showed a significant quadratic relationship (P<0.05) with activity of serum catalase, while linearly decreasing (P<0.05) muscle malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Furthermore, supplementation with 100mgkg-1 SRE significantly decreased (P<0.05) serum MDA content, while 600and 800mgkg-1 SRE supplementation significantly decreased (P<0.05) muscle MDA content. However, SRE supplementation had no significant effect on gut microbiota (P>0.05). Conclusion. These data indicated that dietary SRE supplementation improves the performance and antioxidative capacity of growing-finishing pigs. We recommend that the optimal supplemental level of SRE in the diet of growing-finishing pigs is 100mgkg-1. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4724	4735	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11833					FSTA:2022-11-Sj5898
J		Yunxia Yuan; Di Zhang; Xiaohuan Huang; Yong Yin; Huichun Yu; Xin Li							Early warning potential of cucumber spoilage based on hyperspectral information during its storage.		Food Analytical Methods					In order to realize the early warning of cucumber spoilage during its storage by hyperspectral technology, two batches of cucumbers with different storage dates and different varieties were selected for hyperspectral information collection. The characteristic wavelengths were extracted by principal component analysis (PCA) loading method coupled with Wilks Lambda-statistic. Based on the determination of the respective spoilage benchmark for the two samples, a unified spoilage benchmark for the two was determined through Bhattacharyya distance (B-distance), and an early warning model was established accordingly. Finally, the hyperspectral data of the third batch of cucumbers with different storage conditions and spoilage process from the first two were collected for validation analysis. The results illustrate that the spoilage of the three batches of cucumbers with different storage conditions and different spoilage processes can be characterized by the common characteristic wavelengths because of the similar spectral information, and the spoilage benchmark of the three samples can be unified due to their spectral information is similar. The B-distance early warning model based on the common characteristic wavelength and the unified spoilage benchmark can realize the spoilage detection of the three batches of cucumbers. More importantly, the constructed model can warn the final result of cucumber spoilage as well as the existence of local spoilage to provide decision support for managers. This fully demonstrates that the early warning model of B-distance based on hyperspectral information is robust and reliable to monitor the process of cucumber spoilage. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	10	2691	2702	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-022-02325-z					FSTA:2023-03-Jq4244

Food Science & Nutrition					Kunitz trypsin inhibitor (KTI), a harmful protein, seriously affects food hygiene and safety. Therefore, a sensitive, efficient, and rapid method for KTI detection is urgently needed. Aptamers are short and single-stranded (ss) DNA that recognize target molecules with high affinity. This work used graphene oxide-SELEX (GO-SELEX) to screen KTI aptamers. The positive and reverse screening was designed to ensure the high specificity and affinity of the selected aptamers. After 10 rounds of screening, multiple nucleic acid chains were obtained, and the chains were sequenced. Three aptamers with better affinity were obtained, and the values of the dissociation constant (Kd) were calculated to be 52.6 nM, 22.7 nM, and 67.9 nM, respectively. Finally, a colorimetric aptamer biosensor based on gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) was constructed. The biosensor exhibited a broader linear range of 30-750 ng/ml, with a lower detection limit of 18 ng/ml, and the spiked recovery rate was between 98.2% and 103.3%. This experiment preliminary demonstrated the potential of the application of KTI aptamer in the real sample tests. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					It is crucial to accurately describe non-covalent weak interactions between the components of cholesterol/beta-cyclodextrin inclusion complex in the modulation of its stability. Experimental and theoretical infrared spectra confirmed that the inclusion complex was successfully prepared. Phase solubility studies suggested the formation of 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion complex of cholesterol with beta-CD. The inclusion complex showed higher decomposed temperature (327.3°C) than physical mixture (321.6°C), indicating improved thermal stability of inclusion complex. Conformational search and density functional theory calculations were performed to find the most stable conformation with the lowest complexation energy (-129.66 kJ/mol). Dispersion energy from van der Waals (-283.31 kJ/mol) contributed greatly on total bonding energy (-204.72 kJ/mol). The bond lengths of hydrogen bonds (O127..H221 and O220..H107) were 1.77 and 1.62 A, respectively. Van der Waals and hydrogen bonds were necessary to drive spontaneous formation and maintain the stability of inclusion complex. This study revealed a deep insight into the formation mechanism of cholesterol/beta-CD inclusion complex using computational and experimental approaches, providing theoretical basis for the removal of cholesterol from hydrocolloid-containing systems.

Food Hydrocolloids					The natural sweetener steviol glycosides (STE) have been shown to be an effective biosurfactant for formulation of food emulsions. In this work, we first investigated the impact of pH on the micellar self-assembly of STE, and then evaluated the interfacial and macroscopic emulsion properties of the mixtures of STE with soy protein isolate (SPI) at different pH values (3.0 and 7.0). The results obtained show that as an edible bolaform surfactant, STE is a highly pH-sensitive system, showing interesting pH-dependent interfacial and emulsifying behaviors, which are found to strongly affect its oil-water interfacial interactions with SPI as well as the emulsion properties of the STE-SPI mixtures. Particularly, at low STE concentrations (0.1-0.4 wt%, below critical micelle concentration (CMC)), the adsorption kinetics of mixtures at pH 7.0 is mainly dominated by the STE-SPI complex, forming the interface with a plateau in the elasticity. In contrast, at pH 3.0, the simultaneous adsorption of STE and the STE-SPI complex dominates the formation of interface, resulting in a lower initial interfacial tension and a less viscoelastic film. These interfacial behaviors endow the emulsions prepared by the mixtures with an improved emulsifying ability. On the other hand, at high STE concentrations (0.8 and 1 wt%, above CMC), for the mixtures at pH 7.0, the preferential interfacial adsorption of STE over the complex leads to the formation of a simple interface mainly covered by STE. Contrastly, the interfaces at pH 3.0 are still complex and dominated simultaneously by STE and STE-SPI complex. However, the poor emulsifying capacity of STE at pH 3.0 greatly disturbs the emulsifying properties of the mixtures, resulting in the large oil droplets and the consequent phase separation of emulsions.

Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important foodborne pathogen with diverse serotypes. In May 2021, we investigated a gastroenteritis outbreak that occurred in China, caused by V. parahaemolyticus O10:K4 infection. Based on the epidemiological curve, this outbreak was identified as a homologous exposure event. A case-control study demonstrated that emperor crab with mashed garlic (odds ratio [OR] = 4.60, p = 0.030; 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.11-19.14), goose liver geoduck (OR = 4.50, p = 0.029; 95% CI: 1.12-18.13), shrimp (OR = 4.89, p = 0.021; 95% CI: 1.22-19.65), and sea cucumber (OR = 7.36, p = 0.005; 95% CI: 1.68-32.26) were the potential sources of the food poisoning. V. parahaemolyticus isolates from 18 laboratory-confirmed cases were all serotyped O10:K4, and determined to be sequence type ST3 via multilocus sequence typing. Pulsed field gel electrophoresis and whole-genome sequencing analysis revealed the identical pattern and 0-2 single nucleotide variation among these isolates. tdh was positive in all isolates, while trh and Orf8 were absent. Seven essential base positions in toxRS for pandemic clone identification were identical between the O10:K4 and O3:K6 pandemic clones. Phylogenetic analysis with 45 additional genomes of 13 different serotypes showed the closest genetic relationship between O10:K4 and O1: KUT. O10:K4 was thought to evolve from the O3:K6 pandemic clone. The new serovariant of O3:K6 poses a challenge for the prevention and control of V. parahaemolyticus disease outbreaks, or even epidemics, in the future.										2022	19	8	550	557	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2022.0002					FSTA:2022-12-Cd3975

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Prenylated chalcones are found mainly in plants and exhibit diverse biological and pharmacological activities. Some of these compounds are components of food and dietary supplements with significant health benefits. In plants, they are derived from chalcones by prenylation with membrane-bound prenyltransferases. In this study, we demonstrate prenylations of 10 chalcones by two fungal prenyltransferases (AtaPT/AnaPT) in the presence of dimethylallyl diphosphate. Eleven mono-(1a-10a and 9b) and four diprenylated products (8b, 9c, 10b, and 10c) were obtained. Among them, 12 have new structures (1a, 2a, 4a-6a, 8a, 8b, 9b, 9c, 10a, 10b, and 10c). Most of the obtained prenylated chalcones are products of AnaPT and carry prenyl moieties at ring B. Our study provides an excellent example for increasing structural diversity of plant metabolites with microbial enzymes.										2022	70	5	1610	1617	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07786					FSTA:2022-06-Aj9281

Food Research International					The convenient preparation of rice noodles with excellent mechanical and cooking properties remains a challenge for the food industry. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of different hydroxypropyl starch additions on the quality, performance, and structural characteristics of rice flours and noodles by mechanical property testing, cooking characteristic analysis, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR), and other methods. SEM evaluation revealed that the addition of hydroxypropyl starch created rice noodles with a denser network structure. XRD analysis indicated a decrease in the noodle crystallinity from 11.37 % (control noodles) to 3.94 % (noodles containing 10 % hydroxypropyl starch). LF-NMR characterization confirmed an enhanced water-holding capacity of noodles containing hydroxypropyl starch. The noodle tensile strain increased from 54.97 0.45 % in control noodles to 100.63 1.58 % in noodles containing 3 % hydroxypropyl starch. The cooking loss of dried noodles decreased from 8.30 0.57 % (control noodles) to 5.67 0.16 % (noodles containing 3 % hydroxypropyl starch), and the broken rates were reduced from 77.50 1.54 % of the control noodles to 12.50 1.54 % of the noodles containing 3 % hydroxypropyl starch. The addition of 3 % hydroxypropyl starch can improve the quality of rice noodles and promote the development of the rice industry.

Britt. from different varieties and harvest periods.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Perilla frutescens (L.) Britt. Is a plant that has been classified as one of the "One Root of Medicine and Food", and it can be used both as medicine and as food. To explore the influence of different varieties and harvest periods on the quality of different medicinal parts of P. frutescens, a comprehensive study on the chemical constituents of P. frutescens based on plant metabolomics was conducted. A total of 57 nonvolatile chemical components and 105 volatile chemical components of P. frutescens were characterized by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Furthermore, 35, 27, and 2 nonvolatile constituents as well as 16, 16, and 18 volatile constituents were identified as potential markers for discriminating P. frutescens between different medicinal parts, different varieties, and different harvest periods, respectively. Besides, 22 bioactive compounds of P. frutescens were quantitatively determined by a new sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method. This study comprehensively compares the differences and similarities of P. frutescens among the different medicinal parts, different varieties, and different harvest periods, and the results of this study may provide a theoretical basis and guidance for studying the quality evaluation and the optimization of the harvest period of this plant.										2022	70	28	8838	8853	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03104					FSTA:2022-11-Te4644

Food Control					This article describes the visual detection of bongkrekic acid (BA) by cysteamine modified gold nanoparticles (CS-AuNPs) as colorimetric probes. Polycarboxyl structured BA induces the aggregation of CS-AuNPs through electrostatic interaction, which results in the color change of CS-AuNPs from wine-red to blue-violet. The ratio of absorbance at 650 nm and 524 nm (A650/A524) increases linearly in the 0.18-1.64 muM BA concentration range, and the detection limit is 3.43 nM. Moreover, when combined with solid phase extraction (SPE), the method can also be used for specific detection of BA in complex food matrix (tremella). The recoveries in urine, serum, and tremella ranged from 89.31% to 109.63%. Interestingly, a smartphone application (APP) was applied to identify the R, G, and B values of the solution, and the quantitative curve was established by calculating the gray value. This approach was then used to quantify the BA in the sample solution. The linear range of APP detecting is 0.10 muM-1.44 muM and the detection limit is 12.33 nM. This method can be used not only for food safety monitoring, but also for preliminary clinical screening of BA poisoning.

Food Chemistry					Effects of food microstructure and processing methods on moisture migration in food during processing are important for improving product quality. This study evaluated the effects of fibre directions and dehydration methods on beef dehydration and rehydration behaviours using near-infrared hyperspectral imaging. Beef slices (transversal cut) and splits (longitudinal cut) were dehydrated by hot air drying (HAD) and microwave vacuum drying (MVD). Results indicated the moisture in the slices evaporated faster than that in the splits during HAD and MVD processed samples exhibited higher rehydration rates than HAD ones. Principal component analysis showed great performance in clustering samples based on fibre directions, processing methods and time. The established simplified RC-SG-PLSR and RC-2nd Der-PLSR models possessed good prediction accuracies for moisture (R2p = 0.994) and rehydration rate (R2p = 0.889), respectively. Chemical distribution maps also confirmed the influence of fibre directions and dehydration methods on moisture migration in samples.

Food Research International					This study proposed an optimal way to supplement organic selenium, boost polysaccharides solubility, antioxidant, anticancer, immune responses. A purified polysaccharide fraction of Sagittaria sagittifolia L. (PSSP) was successfully modified with selenium (Se-PSSP), and its characteristics, antioxidant, antineoplastic and immune activities were studied. The structure and the monosaccharide composition were determined by means of UV-visible spectrometry, FT-IR spectra, NMR spectra, X-ray diffraction spectroscopy (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results showed that both PSSP and Se-PSSP contained a pyranoid polysaccharide linked by alpha-glycosidic bonds in the main chain. In addition, PSSP and Se-PSSP were amorphous morphology without three-helix conformation. PSSP (47.12 kDa) was mainly composed of glucose, mannose and xylose with molar percentages of 55.82%, 14.86% and 14.35%, respectively. Se-PSSP (16.82 kDa) is mainly composed of glucose, xylose and galactose with molar percentages of 26.49%, 18.76% and 18.14%, respectively. Compared with PSSP, Se-PSSP showed stronger water-solubility, antioxidant activity, cytotoxicity and immunomodulatory activity than that of PSSP. These results suggested that Se-PSSP is a promising novel Se-supplement and may be served as an excellent potential antioxidant, antineoplastic, and immunomodulatory agents in the field of functional foods and medicine industry.

J		Yuqin Jiang; Zhaojun Wang; Zhiyong He; Maomao Zeng; Fang Qin; Jie Chen							Effect of heat-induced aggregation of soy protein isolate on protein-glutaminase deamidation and the emulsifying properties of deamidated products.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of heat-induced soy protein isolate (SPI) aggregation on enzymatic deamidation by protein-glutaminase (PG) and the emulsifying properties of deamidated products were investigated. The particle size distribution indicated that different aggregates were obtained by preheating SPI at three different temperatures (70°C, 100°C, 121°C) for 10 min. The time-dependent degree of deamidation showed that aggregates formed by preheating treatment had a different influence on the PG deamidation reaction. Preheating treatment at 70°C could accelerate the PG deamidation reaction and preheating treatment at 121°C restrained this reaction. The molecular weight distribution revealed that PG deamidation caused the formation of larger aggregates. Electrophoresis analysis and the structural properties indicated that the aggregation caused by PG deamidation was probably a result of hydrophobic interaction and the formation of disulfide bonds. PG deamidation of native or preheated SPI can improve the emulsifying activity, especially in the sample preheated at 70°C. For SPI samples preheated at 70°C and 100°C, the emulsifying stability increased by PG deamidation. In conclusion, preheating can influence the PG deamidation reaction and the emulsifying properties of deamidated products.

Food Chemistry					Nine black tea samples with different color intensity were firstly determined by chromatic difference analyzer. The color characteristics were secondly quantitatively described by UV-visible spectroscopy. Thirdly, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics analysis was applied in low-molecular-weight compounds. Finally, the color contributors were identified by the correlation analysis of color, spectrometry and mass data. UV-visible based metabolomics analysis revealed that the wavelength at 380-520 nm (VIP > 1.50) was the critical absorbance band for distinguishing different color of BT infusions, while LC-MS based metabolomics analysis indicated that there were 48 main marker compounds responsible for the classification of different BT infusions. Correlation analysis results showed that the coefficients of theaflavins, thearubigins, theabrownins, flavonoid glycosides, and some hydroxycinnamoyl acids were > 0.7, which suggested they were main color contributors of BT infusion.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					the present study aimed to examine the effects of cooking temperatures on meat quality, protein carbonylation and protein cross-linking of fresh beef with different packaging methods. Steaks from beef tenderloins were packed in vacuum or high oxygen modified atmosphere (MAP), and stored for 10 days at 4 °C. After storage, steaks were cooked to different internal temperatures (52, 62, 72 °C). In general, when cooked to higher temperature, MAP packed beef had higher cooking loss, larger values of shear force and smaller values of redness than vacuum packed beef. Meanwhile, increasing cooking temperature generally caused more formation of protein carbonyls - alpha-aminoadipic semialdehyde (AAS) and protein cross-links - lysinonorleucine (LNL), and high oxygen MAP was found to intensify their formations. Increased protein carbonylation via AAS formation and protein cross-linking via the LNL formation seemed to play an important role in quality deterioration of high oxygen MAP packed beef.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The present study aimed to investigate the preservative effect of chitosan-caffeic acid grafts coating (CS-g-CA) on the quality and microbial characteristics of pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) during iced storage. CS-g-CA was prepared by a 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimidehydro/ N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling reaction. The grafting of CS-g-CA was confirmed by UV-visible and Fourier-transform infrared spectra. Samples were treated with distilled water (control), chitosan (CS), caffeic acid (CA) and CS-g-CA for 10min, respectively. Microbiological [total viable count (TVC), H2S-producing bacteria count, Pseudomonas bacteria count], physicochemical indicators [water holding capacity (WHC), cooking loss, pH, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), texture profile analysis, free amino acids] and sensory evaluation were investigated during ice storage at 4°C for up to 27days. Results. The results showed that the antioxidant and antibacterial activities of CS could be improved by grafting CA onto CS. CS-g-CA coating could greatly slow down the speed of water loss and maintain WHC. Furthermore, CS-g-CA coating showed superior antibacterial activities by inhibiting the growth of TVC, delayed the decline of flavor amino acids and reduced sensory change. In addition, CS-g-CA coating reduced lipid oxidation and protein degradation as indicated by the decrease in TBA and TVB-N, possibly as a result of the addition of CA into CS membrane significantly improving the antioxidant activity of CS. Conclusion. Compared with the control group, CS-g-CA coating had the optimal effect and could enhance the shelf-life of Trachinotus ovatus for at least another 9days. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	7	2835	2845	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11624					FSTA:2022-08-Rc3181

Food & Function					Probiotics have shown good efficacy in the prevention of ulcerative colitis (UC), but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, shotgun metagenomic and transcriptome analyses were performed to explore the preventive effect of a potential probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 (Lp082) on UC and its specific mechanism. The results showed that Lp082 intervention ameliorated dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced UC in mice, which was manifested in the increase in body weight, water intake, food intake, and colon length and the decrease in the DAI index, immune organ index, inflammatory factors and histopathological scores after Lp082 intake. The mechanism is deeply studied and it is discovered that Lp082 improves the intestinal mucosal barrier by co-optimizing biological barriers, chemical barriers, mechanical barriers, and immune barriers. Specifically, Lp082 improved the biological barrier by increasing the diversity, optimizing the species composition and the structure of the gut microbiota, increasing bacteria producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and activating microbial metabolic pathways producing SCFAs so as to enhance the content of SCFAs. Lp082 optimized the chemical barrier by decreasing the mRNA expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM and by increasing the content of goblet cells and the mRNA expression and immunofluorescent protein content of mucin2. Lp082 ameliorated the mechanical barrier by decreasing the mRNA expression of claudin-1 and claudin-2, and by increasing the mRNA expression of ZO-1 and ZO-2 and the immunofluorescent protein content of ZO-1. Lp082 also optimized the immune barrier by increasing the mRNA expression of IL-10, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta2 and by decreasing the mRNA expression and protein contents of IL-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and myeloperoxidase (MPO). In addition, Lp082 can also regulate the metabolic pathways of inflammation and disease in mice, and notably, Lp082 inhibits the NF-kappaB signaling pathway by inhibiting NF-kappaB signaling molecules to alleviate UC. In conclusion, improving gut microbiota dysbiosis, protecting the intestinal mucosal barrier, regulating inflammatory and disease pathways, and affecting neutrophil infiltration are the potential mechanisms of probiotic Lp082 in alleviating UC. Our study enriches the mechanism and provides a new prospect for Lactobacillus plantarum HNU082 in the prevention of colitis, provides support for the development of probiotic-based microbial products as an alternative prevention strategy for UC, and provides guidance for the future probiotic prevention of human colitis. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	19	10171	10185	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02303b					FSTA:2023-02-Ad2045

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Gamma-oryzanol (Orz), a mixture of the ferulic acid ester of triterpene alcohols and phytosterols, was found abundantly in rice bran and rice bran oil which could be available and served as an antioxidant. The present study was to explore the potential protective effects of Orz on oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in human hepatic cells (L02 cells) induced by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Flow cytometry detection and Hoechst 33258 staining showed that Orz significantly restored cell cycle and ameliorated apoptosis in H2O2-challenged L02 cells. Orz pretreatment inhibited H2O2-induced cell apoptosis by increasing the scavenging of hydroxyl radicals (OH.), and efficiently decreasing the production of nitric oxide (NO). Moreover, a loss of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were enhanced in H2O2-mediated L02 cells pretreated with Orz. Furthermore, preincubation with Orz reduced H2O2-mediated the proapoptotic protein of Bak expression and the phosphorylation of ASK1, p38, JNK, and ERK, and increased the anti-apoptotic protein of Bcl-xl expression and anti-oxidative stress proteins of Nrf2 and HO-1 expression. The findings suggested that Orz exerts the cytoprotective effects in H2O2-induced L02 cells apoptosis by ameliorating oxidative stress via inhibiting MAPK signaling pathway and activating Nrf2 signaling pathway. Practical applications. Gamma-oryzanol (Orz), a mixture of the ferulic acid ester of triterpene alcohols and phytosterols, was found abundantly in rice bran and rice bran oil which could be availably served as an antioxidant. In this study, it was found that Orz exerts the cytoprotective effects in H2O2-induced L02 cell apoptosis by ameliorating oxidative stress via the inhibition of MAPK signaling pathway and the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway, which provides a theoretical basis for dietary adding natural products to prevent or treat oxidative stress-related diseases. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14118					FSTA:2022-11-Ne2458

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The proteins in the raw materials affect the formation of flavour during fermentation. Among all the fermentation broth of protein fraction in the study, the rice prolamin and albumin effectively promoted floral, honey and fruity characteristics in fermentation with higher level of beta-phenylethyl alcohol, 2,4-dimethyl-benzaldehyde and ethyl hexadecanoate than those in the fermentation of globulin and glutelin; albumin is with higher level of higher alcohols, but higher alcohols are not good for health because of their acute toxicity and neurotoxic effects. In a further fermentation experiment of addition of prolamin, extra prolamin significantly promoted the formation of aroma volatiles, especially medium and long fatty acid esters and beta-phenylethyl alcohol and its acetate, and the content of beta-phenethyl acetate in sweet rice wine with added prolamin was more than twice that of single sweet rice wine. This study demonstrates that the different rice protein components significantly affect the volatiles generated by microorganism metabolism to impact the flavour of sweet rice wine, and the flavour quality of sweet rice wine can be enhanced by increasing the prolamin content. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	6	3604	3615	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15684					FSTA:2022-09-Hc8110

Food Chemistry					To systematically study the impact of root restriction (RR) on the aroma quality of grape berry, in this study, free and bound compounds were investigated in "Red Alexandria" grape skin and pulp produced with and without RR during development and ripening. Compared with the control, RR advanced the initiation of free-terpene synthesis and increased their concentrations at 14-18 weeks post-flowering (wpf) by promoting the conversion of bound terpenes to free terpenes. In addition, RR significantly regulated the aromatic series at 14-18 wpf and advanced the date of aroma maturation. Network analyses indicated that the correlations among bound compounds were more conserved than those among free compounds, and the skin network displayed tight coordination compared with the pulp network. Terpenes were highly intercorrelated and played a core role in these networks. Finally, 10 bound compounds in pulp were screened out as indicators of the developmental timing of grape.

Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Obesity is a worldwide epidemic and increases the risk of metabolic syndrome through chronic inflammation. Tea polyphenols (TP), the major functional component of tea, has shown preventive effects on obesity and obesity-related disease, but the underlying mechanism is complicated and remains obscure. The present study was aimed to elucidate the anti-inflammation effect of TP in high-fat-diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Results showed that TP reduced obesity-induced inflammation and systemic lipopolysaccharides (LPS) level. The decrease of LPS level in circulation was followed by the downregulation of LPS specific receptor, toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), and its co-receptor cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) and adaptor protein differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) in hepatic and adipose tissues. That further inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB). The serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1-beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly decreased by TP in HFD-fed mice. TP also maintained the intestinal barrier integrity by increasing intestinal tight junction proteins and reversed gut dysbiosis in obese mice. These results suggested that TP attenuated obesity-induced inflammation by reducing systemic LPS level and inhibiting LPS-activated TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	77	1	105	111	0921-9668				10.1007/s11130-021-00937-0					FSTA:2023-02-Hn2057

Food & Function					Gelidium amansii (GA) is a kind of red alga homologous to medicine and food and is distributed all over the world. Studies on GA are mainly focused on its polysaccharides, with little research on the ethanol extract. The ethanol extract of Gelidium amansii (GAE) was subjected to a reverse-phase column to obtain 7 components. Among them, 100% methanol solution (GAM), enriched with phytene-1,2-diol, exhibited the strongest DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC50 = 0.17mg mL-1). Subsequently, high-fat male flies (HMFs) were used as a model to explore the antioxidant and anti-aging effects of GAM in vivo. Studies showed that GAM can effectively prolong the lifespan of HMFs. When GAM concentrations were 0.2 and 1.0mg mL-1, the average lifespan of HMFs was increased by 28.7 and 40.7%, respectively, while the longest lifespan of HMFs was increased by 20.55% and 32.88%, respectively. Further research revealed that GAM can significantly downregulate the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and protein carbonyl (PCO), and can significantly upregulate the levels of catalase (CAT) and total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD). In addition, by analyzing differential metabolites, we found that GAM relieves aging caused by oxidative stress by regulating amino acid, lipid, sugar, and energy metabolism. The GAM group significantly regulated the levels of adenine, cholic acid, glutamate, l-proline, niacin, and stachyose which tend to recover to the levels of the normal diet male fly (NMF) group. In general, our research provides ideas for the high-value utilization of GA and provides a lead compound for the research and development of anti-aging food or medicine. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	19	10110	10120	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02116a					FSTA:2023-02-Rg0531

In this article, the protective effects of DIO against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice were researched. Compared with the 2.5% DSS treatment group, 15 mg/kg body weight of diosgenin alleviated colitis disease, evidenced by the increased body weight, the decrease in the disease activity index, and the histological scores. Furthermore, 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results demonstrated that DIO improved the colon homeostasis through modulating the gut microbiota, including increases in the relative abundance of several probiotic bacteria, such as Prevotellaceae (from 1.4% to 5.8%), Lactobacillus (from 12.3% to 29.7%), Mucispirillum (from 0.07% to 0.49%), and decreases in the pathogenic bacteria, such as Streptococcus (from 1.6% to 0.6%) and Pseudomonadaceae (from 0.004% to 0%). In addition, the concentration of gut microbial metabolites, total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), acetic acid, and propionic acid were significantly increased after DIO supplementation. In conclusion, our findings suggested that DIO attenuates DSS-induced colitis in mice by means of modulating imbalanced gut microbiota and increases in SCFA generation.										2022	25	3	261	271	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0086					FSTA:2023-01-Aj0727
J		Yushuang Li; Longhe Yang; Sijia Wu; Junde Chen; Haowei Lin							Structural, functional, rheological, and biological properties of the swim bladder collagen extracted from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The objective of this study was to develop an aquatic collagen with high thermal stability as a possible alternative to terrestrial sources. Swim bladder collagen (SBC) was extracted from grass carp with high yield of 39.2% (db), and characterized as type I collagen. X-ray diffraction indicated that SBC maintains a native triple helical collagen structure. Secondary structure analysis revealed that SBC consists of 41.93% alpha-helices, 45.31% beta-sheets, 12.76% beta-turns, and 0% random coils. Proteins from SBC exhibited foaming and emulsifying superiority to proteins from terrestrial sources, such as chicken feet collagen. The thermal denaturation temperature of SBC (34.3°C) is similar to porcine skin collagen. Dynamic frequency sweep tests showed that elasticity plays a dominant role in the SBC solution system as the concentration increases. The SBC solution system shows viscous behavior when the temperature is below Td. In addition, the steady shear tests showed that all of the SBC solutions exhibited pseudoplasticity with shear-thinning behavior. SBC could provide a suitable environment for MC3T3-E1 cell growth and maintain normal cellular morphology. Overall, the results indicated that SBC might has potential for further applications in food, cosmetics and biomedical fields.

J		Yusif Maigoro, A.; Dayoung An; Soojin Lee							Exploring the link between vitamin D deficiency and cytokine storms in COVID-19 patients: an in silico analysis.		Journal of Medicinal Food					COVID-19 has become a global infectious pandemic affecting the entire world with complications related to the lungs and compromised immune systems. Recently, cytokine storms, which are hallmarks of the disease, have been identified in most COVID-19 patients. In addition, vitamin D deficiency is increasingly appearing to be another element exposing COVID-19 patients to a preferential increase in their symptoms. In an effort to identify a possible link between cytokine storms and vitamin D deficiency to streamline a possible treatment, an in silico analysis using bioinformatics approach was performed using collections of highly expressed cytokines in both severe acute respiratory syndrome and COVID-19 patients (commonly elevated cytokines) as well as vitamin D deficiency-associated genes (VD). Gene Multiple Association Network Integration Algorithm was used for network interactions, whereas the Enrichr enrichment analysis tool was used for biological functions. The network analysis GLay clustering results indicated the vitamin D receptor as a possible link between these two groups. Furthermore, cell chemotaxis and chemotactic-related features were identified as significantly affected pathways, which serve as possible key players mitigating cytokine storms under low vitamin D availability.										2022	25	2	130	137	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0085					FSTA:2022-12-Aj22359

Physical properties and prebiotic activity of white dragon fruit (Hylocereus undatus) powders produced using different wall materials.		International Food Research Journal					The aim of the present work was to investigate the spray-dried characteristics such as physical properties, morphologies, glass transition temperatures (T g), and prebiotic activity of white dragon fruit (WDF) powders produced using different wall materials, namely resistant maltodextrin (RMD) and maltodextrin (MD), at optimum spray drying conditions. Results showed that RMD decreased water activity and moisture content, and increased bulk density and true density of powder more than MD. In addition, the particle size of RMD-coated powder (WRMD) was smaller than that of MD-coated powder (WMD), and the morphology of the WRMD powder showed that it had a smooth surface as compared to WMD powder, where shrinkage and dent surfaces were observed. The Tg of WMD powder had higher value, but both types of powders were not significantly (p > 0.05) different. Then, both powders were further investigated for their ability to support the growth of Bifidobacterium longum BB536 and Lactobacillus casei Shirota. The growth of the anaerobic bacteria was determined every 6 h for 24 h at 37°C in six modified MRS media containing glucose, RMD, MD, WRMD powder, WMD powder, and fructooligosaccharides (FOS) as the substrates. Results indicated that all substrates significantly (p < 0.05) increased the growth of the probiotic bacteria, with WRMD powder yielding the highest bacterial count. Based on the findings, WRMD powder can be considerably used as a new prebiotic source for the functional food industry.										2022	29	2	357	368	1985-4668									FSTA:2022-09-Jg12257
J		Yusoff, N. A. H.; Rukayadi, Y.; Abas, F.; Khatib, A.; Hassan, M.							Application of Cosmos caudatus Kunth. (ulam raja) extract as antibacterial agent in beef and shrimp meats, and its sensory evaluation.		International Food Research Journal					The use of chemical preservatives in food products to inhibit the growth of microorganisms is widely used nowadays. However, their use has become a concern due to several negative side effects, and when consumers question the safety of the foods they eat. Therefore, the present work was conducted to investigate the potential of plant natural sanitiser from Cosmos caudatus Kunth extract to reduce the natural microflora present in raw beef and shrimp meat samples. The present work aimed to investigate the reduction of natural microflora (B. cereus, E. coli, Pseudomonas spp., S. aureus, and L. monocytogenes) in raw beef and shrimp meat samples following sanitisation with different concentrations of C. caudatus extract (0.05, 0.50, and 5.00%) at different soaking times (5, 10, and 15 min). The sanitised samples were further evaluated with sensory acceptability (colour, odour, texture, and overall acceptability) to determine their acceptance level after treatment. Based on the results, the microflora in beef and shrimp meat samples were reduced significantly (p< 0.05) started from 0.05% at varied soaking times. The decrease in bacterial populations was proportional to the increase in extract concentrations and soaking times. In sensory acceptability, all cooked samples achieved acceptance level by the panellists at 0.05% after 10 min of soaking time. Food samples treated with 0.05% of C. caudatus extract and 10min of soaking time showed the best combination in terms of bacterial reduction and the level of acceptance by the panellists. Hence, it can be concluded that C. caudatus extract has a high potential as a natural-based food sanitiser that can prevent bacterial contamination while maintaining the sensory acceptability of the foods.										2022	29	4	918	928	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.4.19					FSTA:2023-01-Sg0275
J		Yusong Wang; Ka-Young Song; Yookyung Kim							Effects of thermally treated mulberry leaves on the quality, properties, and antioxidant activities of yogurt.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Mulberry leaf extract (MLE) was used to enhance the functionality of yogurt. Yogurt was fermented with 15% MLE prepared using different thermal treatment methods: no treatment (MY), steamed (SMY), and roasted (RMY). The controls were yogurt with no MLE (Y) and green tea extract (GY). Yogurt acidity was not significantly different among the samples after 8 hr of fermentation. Lactobacilli count was higher in MLE yogurts, with the thermal treatment method not impacting the count. MLE yogurts had high total anthocyanin, phenolic, and flavonoid contents and increased DPPH scavenging capacity. RMY showed the highest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. MY had higher scores for MLE flavor, sourness, and astringency than Y. However, RMY had improved scores for sourness and astringency and high scores for sweetness and overall acceptability, which were higher than that of GY. Roasted mulberry leaf extract therefore has potential as a health supplement for food. Practical applications. Mulberry leaves have been used as silkworm feed and in traditional medicine in Asia because of their high nutrient content and functional properties. However, the use of mulberry leaves as a food additive has been limited due to their unique aroma and bitter taste. To evaluate the potential application of mulberry leaf extract as a supplement in yogurt, thermal treatments of mulberry leavers were performed prior to extraction. Steamed and roasted mulberry leaves had a reduced off-flavor and less of a bitter taste, and improved the functionality of yogurt, namely, antioxidant capacity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. In particular, roasted mulberry leaf extract had higher functionality and better sensory score than green tea extract, which is used as an additive in commercial products, making it a better supplement for fortified yogurt products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16139					FSTA:2022-04-Pl1888

Possibility to use the different sizes and colors of carrots for the production of juices - comparison of bioactive compounds, nutritional quality, pro-health properties, and sensory evaluation.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Carrot is a popular vegetable consumed by people of all age groups and is used in various food products because of its high nutritional content, especially vitamin A. Results. In the present study, colorful fresh carrot juices of 12 carrot varieties were investigated for in vitro antidiabetic, anti-aging, and anti-obesity activities with antioxidant potential by ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) and FRAP (ferric reducing ability of plasma) assays. The studied juices were also compared for physicochemical characteristics: titratable acidity, pH, pectin content, total soluble solids, dry mass, ash, viscosity, turbidity, osmolality, and color. The results of the study showed that normal purple carrot juice exhibited the best activities in all biological and antioxidant tests, except for anti-alpha-glucosidase activity. Normal purple carrot juice also had the highest total mineral content with elevated results for titratable acidity, pH, total soluble solids, dry mass, ash, viscosity, and osmolality. Conclusion. Purple carrot juices demonstrated elevated health-promoting activities and could be used in blended beverage recipes to attract children's attention. The results of sensorial characteristics (appearance, color, and taste) of juices, however, showed that people are more familiar with orange carrot products. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	103	2	933	943	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12206					FSTA:2023-03-Hq3087
J		Yuteng Fu; McClements, D. J.; Shunjing Luo; Jiangping Ye; Chengmei Liu							Degradation kinetics of rutin encapsulated in oil-in-water emulsions: impact of particle size.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Rutin is a natural bioactive flavonoid that is poor in water solubility and chemical stability. Encapsulation can be used to protect bioactive molecules from chemical or physical decomposition during food processing and storage. Thus, the effect of initial particle size on the ability of oil-in-water emulsions to retain rutin during storage was investigated. Results. Rutin was encapsulated in oil-in-water emulsions with different mean surface-weighted diameters: d3,2 = 0.56mum (small), 0.73mum (medium), and 2.32mum (large). As expected, the resistance of the emulsions to coalescence and creaming during storage increased as the particle size decreased due to weakening of the colloidal and gravitational forces acting on the droplets. The concentration of rutin in the emulsions decreased during storage (28 days), which was mainly attributed to photodegradation of the flavonoid. The loss of rutin from the emulsions during storage was fitted using a second-order equation. The rutin degradation rate constant k decreased and the half-life t1/2 increased with decreasing droplet size, which was attributed to the stronger encapsulation and light scattering by smaller oil droplets reducing the amount of light that can penetrate into the emulsions. Conclusion. This study has important implications for the design of more efficacious emulsion-based delivery systems for incorporating health-promoting nutraceuticals into foods. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	103	2	770	778	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12188					FSTA:2023-03-Ae5886

Food Control					An ultrasound-assisted acetonitrile extraction method was applied for the determination of 43 pesticide residues in intact grape berries (Vitis Vinifera L.) by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results showed that ultrasound-assisted extraction from intact grape berries exhibited better efficiency than extraction from homogenized grape berries. Matrix-matched calibration curves were applied from 0.01 to 200mug/L and determination coefficients (R2) were greater than 0.99. The recovery values were 70.6%-119.7% with a relative standard deviation (RSD) range of 0.02%-9.92%. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) ranged between 0.005mug/kg and 0.2mug/kg, and between 0.10mug/kg and 10mug/kg, respectively. The method was applied in the analysis of wine grape samples from three different regions of China. A total of 10 pesticides were detected in samples during fruit ripeness.

J		Yuting Fan; Qingyu He; Chao Gan; Zhen Wen; Jiang Yi							Investigation of binding interaction between bovine alpha-lactalbumin and procyanidin B2 by spectroscopic methods and molecular docking.		Food Chemistry					The interactions between bovine alpha-lactalbumin and procyanidin B2 were fully investigated by spectroscopic methods and molecular docking. This study hypothesized that ALA could spontaneously interact with procyanidin B2 to form protein-based complex delivery carrier. Far UV CD and FTIR data demonstrated ALA's secondary structures were altered and intrinsic fluorescence quenching suggested ALA conformation was changed with procyanidin B2. Calorimetric technique illustrated ALA-procyanidin B2 complexation was a spontaneous and exothermic process with the number of binding site (n, 3.53) and the binding constant (Kb, 2.16 * 104 M-1). A stable nano-delivery system with ALA can be formed for encapsulating, stabilizing and delivering procyanidin B2. Molecular docking study further elucidated that hydrogen bonds dominated procyanidin B2 binding to ALA in a hydrophobic pocket. This study shows great potential in using ALA as protein-based nanocarriers for oral delivery of hydrophilic nutraceuticals, because procyanidin B2-loaded ALA complex delivery systems can be spontaneously formed.

J		Yuting Fan; Guanhai Li; Jiang Yi; Huimin Huang							Structural characteristics, emulsifying and foaming properties of laccase-crosslinked bovine alpha-lactalbumin mediated by caffeic acid.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, laccase (LA) was chosen as a commonly employed enzyme to research the impacts of enzyme-catalyzed crosslinking (polymerization) on the structural, emulsifying and foaming properties of bovine alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) in the presence of caffeic acid (CA). High pressure size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) demonstrated the formation of alpha-LA aggregates (dimers, trimers, and polymers) by LA-induced crosslinking with CA, consistent with the particle size distribution results. LA-induced treatment exhibited pronounced influences on the conformation, secondary and tertiary structure of alpha-LA, as confirmed by circular dichroism (CD), and fluorescence spectroscopy. For alpha-LA-LA-CA, alpha-helix content was progressively decreased from 33.3% (0 h) to 24.7% (24 h). LA-catalyzed crosslinking resulted in the exposure of interior hydrophobic groups, and the increase of zeta-potential values of alpha-LA. Apparent viscosity of alpha-LA was considerably enhanced by LA-induced crosslinking with CA. The emulsifying activity and stability of alpha-LA can be considerably improved with LA-catalyzed crosslinking with CA except at 24 h incubation time. Compared with controls, LA-catalyzed polymerizations of alpha-LA molecules with CA led to the increase of foaming activity and stability regardless of incubation time. After 24 h incubation, the foaming stability (FS) of alpha-LA was 81.0%, whereas the value was 88.0% for alpha-LA-LA-CA. This research indicates that LA-induced modification possesses great potential in ameliorating the emulsifying and foaming capacities of alpha-LA.

Foods					Peanuts are a rich dietary source of lipids, which are essential for human health. In this study, the lipid contents of 13 peanut cultivars were analyzed using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS and GC-MS. The OXITEST reactor was used to test their lipid oxidation stabilities. A total of 27 subclasses, 229 individual lipids were detected. The combined analysis of lipid and oxidation stability showed that lipid unsaturation was inversely correlated with oxidation stability. Moreover, lipid profiles differed significantly among the different peanut cultivars. A total of 11 lipid molecules (TG 18:2/18:2/18:2, TG 24:0/18:2/18:3, TG 20:5/14:1/18:2, TG 18:2/14:1/18:2, PE 17:0/18:2, BisMePA 18:2/18:2, PG 38:5, PMe 18:1/18:1, PC 18:1/18:1, MGDG 18:1/18:1, TG 10:0/10:1/18:1) might be employed as possible indicators to identify high oleic acid (OA) and non-high OA peanut cultivars, based on the PLS-DA result of lipid molecules with a VIP value greater than 2. This comprehensive analysis will help in the rational selection and application of peanut cultivars. © 2021 by the authors.

Mushroom carboxymethylated beta-D-glucan functions as a macrophage-targeting carrier for iron oxide nanoparticles and an inducer of proinflammatory macrophage polarization for immunotherapy.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					beta-D-glucans have the potential of serving as both macrophage-targeted carriers and immune stimulators via inducing trained immunity in macrophages. In this study, a carboxymethylated beta-glucan from mushroom sclerotium of Pleurotus tuberregium (CMPTR) was combined with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) to form nanocomplexes (CMPTR/IONPs) with particle size around 193 7 nm, which could exert a concerted effect on inducing proinflammatory M1 phenotype macrophages for immunotherapy. This nanocomplex exhibited good stability and low cytotoxicity (over 80% cellular viability of RAW 264.7 and THP-1) and higher cellular uptake by murine macrophages compared with B16F10 cells (p < 0.05). CMPTR/IONPs could convert M2-like bone marrow-derived macrophages into M1 phenotypes with upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL12 and TNF-alpha, p < 0.05) and reduced immune-suppressive cytokines (IL10 and TGF-beta, p < 0.05). Such polarization was mediated by the combined signaling regulatory factors, including IONP-stimulated IRF5 and CMPTR-triggered TLRs-NF-kappaB pathways (p < 0.05). Accordingly, CMPTR could have a dual function as a macrophage-targeting carrier for IONPs and an immunostimulant to induce inflammatory M1macrophage polarization for immunotherapy.										2022	70	23	7110	7121	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01710					FSTA:2022-11-Jq15107

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					An industrially scalable complex coacervation process (referred to as the CoCo process) enables the formation of dry complex coacervated microcapsules in one step using a low-cost spray drying approach. Here, we demonstrated the feasibility of maintaining the activity of an enzyme directly coacervated with alginates in dry powder particles by the CoCo process. As a proof of concept, bromelain, an enzyme mixture extracted from pineapple, was used to form bromelain-alginate complex coacervated (CoCo) powder. The proteolytic activity of bromelain was fully recovered from the bromelain-alginate CoCo powder, with approximately 40% of the protein coacervated with alginate. Preservation of enzyme activity by the CoCo process demonstrates the potential for scalable, cost-effective application of enzymes in foods, as well as nutraceutical, household, and industrial products.

J		Yuting Xia; Yan Wang; Shangrong Lou; Mengting Wen; Xuewen Ni							Fabrication and characterization of zein-encapsulated Litsea cubeba oil nanoparticles and its effect on the quality of fresh pork.		Food Bioscience					This study aims to fabricate and characterize zein-encapsulated Litsea cubeba oil nanoparticles (NZ/LCO) and evaluate its effect on pork preservation. The formation, morphology, interactions, thermal stability, antibacterial and antioxidant properties and in vitro release of NZ/LCO were investigated. NZ/LCO showed a spherical shape with a smooth outer wall under scanning electron microscope. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that there were hydrogen bonding interactions between Litsea cubeba oil (LCO) and zein. The glass transition temperature of NZ/LCO was higher than that of zein nanoparticles by differential scanning calorimetry. Encapsulation of LCO in zein improved antibacterial and antioxidant activities of LCO. The antibacterial effect of NZ/LCO against Staphylococcus aureus was stronger than that against Escherichia coli. NZ/LCO exhibited sustained and pH-dependent release of LCO in vitro, and the release was faster in pH 4.5 buffer than in pH 7 buffer. When the ratio of zein to LCO was 1:0.5, the particle size and polydispersity index of NZ/LCO were 128.3 nm and 0.148, respectively, and its performance was the best. Compared with the coating containing free LCO, the coating containing NZ/LCO had better preservation effect on pork because it better delayed the changes in color, pH and texture of pork, and inhibited lipid oxidation and microbial growth more effectively. The findings suggest that NZ/LCO has a high potential for pork preservation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	49				2212-4292				10.1016/j.fbio.2022.101834					FSTA:2023-01-Sj0222

Food Chemistry					Millet Huangjiu (MHJ), a type of northern Huangjiu with a long history, has attracted considerable attention in China and East Asia for its unique flavor. To elucidate the changing course of aroma components during the fermentation process of MHJ, 15 MHJ samples prepared at different fermentation stages were assessed by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) and odor activity value (OAV) coupled with multivariate data analysis. A total of 66 volatile compounds were identified, among which 21 odorant active substances were regarded as the main aroma components (OAVs≥1). The numbers and contents of esters in MHJs accumulated with the extension of fermentation time. Ethanol, ethyl acetate, phenylethyl alcohol and other 7 aromatic substances are the key flavoring agents in the final fermented MHJ. Orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed that 14 volatile compounds (formic acid, ethanol, etc.) are supposed to be the key substances that cause significant differences in MHJ flavor at different fermentation stages.

Food & Function					Obesity, often accompanied by hepatic steatosis, has been associated with an increased risk of health complications such as fatty liver disease and certain cancers. Ferula lehmannii Boiss., a food and medicine homologue, has been used for centuries as a seasoning showing anti-bacterial and anti-oxidant effects on digestive discomfort. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether a short-term oral administration of water extract of Ferula lehmanni Boiss. (WEFL) could prevent high-fat diet (HFD)-induced abnormal weight gain and hepatic steatosis in mice and its underlying mechanisms. WEFL reduced HFD-increased body weight, liver injury markers and inflammatory cytokines (i.e. IL-6 and IL-1beta), and inhibited the elevation of AMPKalpha, SREBP-1c and FAS in HFD. Moreover, WEFL reconstructed the gut microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundances of beneficial bacteria, e.g.Akkermansia spp., while decreasing Desulfovibrio spp. and so on, thereby reversing the detrimental effects of HFD in mice. Removal of the gut microbiota with antibiotics partially eliminated the hepatoprotective effects of WEFL. Notably, WEFL substantially promoted the levels of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyric acid. To clarify the functional components at play in WEFL, we used UPLC-MS/MS to comprehensively detect its substance composition and found it to be a collection of polyphenol-rich compounds. Together, our findings demonstrate that WEFL prevented HFD-induced obesity and liver injury through the hepatic-microbiota axis, and such health-promoting value might be explained by the enriched abundant polyphenols. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1603	1616	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03518e					FSTA:2022-06-Tc2017

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Green tea polyphenols (GTP) have similar activities as prebiotics, which effectively regulate the structure of intestinal flora and affect their metabolic pathways. The intestinal flora is closely related to the host's circadian rhythm, and the supplementation with GTP may be an effective way to improve circadian rhythm disorders. In this study, we established a mouse model of circadian rhythm disturbance of anthropogenic flora to investigate the regulation mechanism of GTP on the host circadian rhythms. After 4 weeks of GTP administration, the results showed that GTP significantly alleviated the structural disorder of intestinal microbiota, thus effectively regulating related metabolites associated with brain nerves and circadian rhythms. Moreover, single-cell transcription of the mouse hypothalamus suggested that GTP up-regulated the number of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and adjusted the expression of core clock genes Csnk1d, Clock, Per3, Cry2, and BhIhe41 caused by circadian disruption. Therefore, this study provided evidence that GTP can improve the physiological health of hosts with the circadian disorder by positively affecting intestinal flora and related metabolites and regulating circadian gene expression.										2022	70	6	1890	1901	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07594					FSTA:2022-11-Hn10670

Journal of Functional Foods					Halocynthia roretzi has been cultured and utilized as a nutritious seafood in Southeastern Asia for many years because of its abundance active molecules. Here, we reported that feeding of H. roretzi tissues resulted in improving oral glucose tolerance in rats. To screen the active components, we identified 950 chemical compounds from H. roretzi metabolome. Furthermore, 11molecules with the activity of regulating blood glucose and lipids were selected based on structural identity. Among them, two natural products, hesperetin and astaxanthin were selected for further quantitative detection. The results showed that concentrations of hesperetin and astaxanthin in the tissues of H. roretzi were calculated to be 13.7 9.5 and 167.9 48.4 g/100g, respectively. The high content of astaxanthin in H. roretzi indicates its potential roles and functions in anti-diabetes activity. Taken together, our results showed that H. roretzi could be used as a functional food supplement for regulating lipid/glucose metabolism.

The stability and binding properties of CGA on LF and its antiproliferative effect on colorectal cancer SW480 cells were investigated by spectroscopic and cell experiments. The results showed that CGA could stabilize LF solution by reducing particle size (below 90 nm) and increasing zeta potential (over 14 in the absolute value). With addition of CGA, the UV absorption peak of LF solution changed (from 287 nm shifted to 290 nm) and fluorescence quenching occurred at the same time. By molecular dynamics calculation, the binding site number of CGA to LF was between 2 and 3 sites. Negative Gibbs free energy of (DeltaG =-25.750.84) indicated that the interaction between LF and CGA can occur spontaneously and effectively. Cell viability and apoptosis test showed that CGA and LF inhibited the growth of colorectal cancer SW480 cells in a synergistic way. Most of cells were arrested at G/G1 phase by the CGA-LF complex. We conclude that CGA can bind to LF to form a relatively stable complex under natural conditions, which increases their antiproliferative function on colorectal cancer cells.

Food Chemistry					Forest frog (Rana chensinensis) eggs contain high-quality protein but have not been well utilized. In this study, the total protein of forest frog eggs was extracted and 4491 protein/peptides were identified by HPLC-MS/MS. The egg protein was glycated using monosaccharides (lactose, fructose, xylose and glucose). The xylose modified egg protein showed excellent emulsifying ability, high viscosity and uniform structure under the laser confocal microscope in a concentration dependent way (1-3%, w/v). We next used xylose glycated egg protein to encapsulate curcumin to determine the stability of its emulsion system. This emulsion system showed low particle size (< 400 nm) and high Zeta-potential (> 30 mV with absolute value) at pH > 6. The system was stable under 4 °C, 25 °C and 37 °C after seven weeks" storage, especially for the emulsions at 3% and 5% concentrations. Therefore, the glycated frog egg protein can be used to encapsulate hydrophobic nutrients.

Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of different moisture contents on the digestible fragments and molecular structures of high amylose jackfruit starch were investigated. The digestible fragments and molecular structures of rapidly digestible starch, slowly digestible starch and resistant starch of high amylose jackfruit starch with different moisture contents prepared by improved extrusion cooking technology were analyzed. Decreasing the moisture content resulted in significant decrease in slowly digestible starch and resistant starch content (24.08% and 25.99%-17.59% and 16.60%), indicating that high amylose jackfruit starch with low moisture content was easier to digest. Compared to extruded control starches, the slowly digestible starch + resistant starch fraction and resistant starch samples exhibited higher gelatinization enthalpy, relative crystallinity, and short-range molecular order, but no significant difference was showed in gelatinization temperature. It was also found that the double helix degree, crystallinity and order degree of the extruded controls, slowly digestible starch + resistant starch fractions and resistant starch samples were increased with increasing moisture content, from 1.74 J/g, 1.52% and 0.207-9.52 J/g, 32.54% and 0.779, respectively. The above results were further supported by the microstructural and porosity analysis that the extruded samples were changed from coarser surface structure to more compact structure with increasing moisture content. All these results indicate that moisture content affects the digestible fragments and molecular structures of starch. Therefore, it can provide a theoretical basis for the modification of high amylose starch, especially for the modification of resistant starch.

J.; Long Chen; Jie Long; Aiquan Jiao; Jinpeng Wang; Xueming Xu; Zhengyu Jin; Chao Qiu							Construction of functional soybean peptide-cyclodextrin carboxylate nanoparticles and their interaction with porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase.		Food Research International					In this study, soybean peptide-succinic acid-modified cyclodextrin (SPT-SACD) nanoparticles (NPs) were successfully fabricated by combining SPT and SACD using an antisolvent precipitation approach. The effects of the average molecular weight of SPT and the SPT/SACD mass ratio on the structure and properties of the SACD-SPT NPs were investigated. Under optimal conditions, the SPT/SACD mass ratio was 2:1, and the SPT average molecular weight was 300 Da. SPT-SACD NPs were prepared under these conditions were spherical and had good uniformity. The particle sizes by DLS of SPT1 (300 Da) /SACD and SPT2 (500 Da) /SACD were in the range of 250-400 nm. The interaction between alpha-amylase and SPT-SACD NPs was investigated using ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) absorption, fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The results of the fluorescence spectra and CD spectroscopy suggested that the presence of SPT-SACD NPs changed the microenvironment of the aromatic amino acid residues, which leads to the change of enzyme protein structure. The SPT-SACD NPs statically quenched the intrinsic fluorescence of the alpha-amylase by forming a complex with the enzyme. Moreover, the SPT-SACD NPs significantly improved the inhibitory effect of EGCG on alpha-amylase. The semi-inhibitory concentration (IC50) decreased from 0.324 to 0.248 mg/mL. This study provides an improved understanding of the interaction mechanism between polypeptide-cyclodextrin complexes and digestive enzymes, which may facilitate the design of functional foods.

J		Yuwei Chang; Li Yan Chan; Fanzhou Kong; Guangtao Zhang; Hong Peng							An innovative approach for real-time authentication of cocoa butter using a combination of rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry and chemometrics.		Food Control					Cocoa butter (CB) is one of the most valuable raw materials in the chocolate industry, and its authenticity is essential to guarantee the safety and quality of chocolate products. For the first time, a real-time and high-throughput method using rapid evaporative ionization mass spectrometry (REIMS) was developed to determine the authenticity of CB. Various types of CB and cocoa butter equivalents (CBEs), as well as CB adulterated by the addition of CBEs, were measured, and different chemometric approaches were implemented for different adulteration scenarios. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was performed to obtain an overview of the dataset, exploring similarities and differences between CB and CBEs. An orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was developed to differentiate between authentic and adulterated CB. A classification accuracy of 100% was achieved, and CBEs could be detected at a level of 10%. A one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) model capable of detecting unsuspected adulterants was successfully built. This model had 95% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Single-origin CB was successfully differentiated from blended CB. This study demonstrated that REIMS could be used as a rapid and sensitive approach for authentication and adulteration analysis of CB. The methodology could enhance the ability of chocolate manufacturers in ensuring the authenticity of their products, helping to avoid complex and ever-changing fraudulent activities.

J		Yuwei Dai; Jie Cao; Yu Zhang; Feng He; Lin Jiang							Study on sialic acid binding state in stewed bird's nest and optimization of enzymatic extraction of free and oligosaccharide-bound sialic acid.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. As a traditional Chinese health food, edible bird's nest (EBN) has high medicinal value, which is mostly attributed to the high content of sialic acid (SA). SA mainly exists in protein-bound, oligosaccharide-bound, and free forms and the binding forms of SA are closely related to the functions of EBN. Objective. To establish a simple but robust method to distinguish and determinate the free and oligosaccharide-bound SA content and the protein-bound SA content, and investigate the changes to SA binding states in EBN during different processing. Methods. Protein-bound SA in EBN was separated from other forms of SA by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and SA content was determined by HPLC. The effects of stewing conditions on the distribution of SA in EBN were investigated and response surface methodology was used to explore the optimal conditions for enzymatic extraction of free and oligosaccharide-bound SA from EBN. Results. The average recoveries of free and oligosaccharide-bound SA and protein-bound SA were 97.82-98.92% and 94.67-95.75%, respectively. The content of free and oligosaccharide-bound SA in stewed EBN was proportional to the stewing temperature, stewing time, and liquid to material ratio, while that of protein-bound SA was inversely proportional to those factors. Through response surface analysis, we found that the optimum technological parameters were as follows: liquid to material ratio, 60:1; enzymolysis time, 2 h; enzyme dosage; 12000 U/g (alkaline protease); pH, 11; enzymolysis temperature, 60°C. Conclusion. This method can not only distinguish between free and oligosaccharide-bound SA and protein-bound SA effectively, but can also determine the contents of them. The results of the investigation on stewing conditions and response surface analysis can be used as the theoretical basis for further pharmacological research of EBN, and can also provide theoretical guidance for the development of EBN products. Highlights. A method for the determination of free and oligosaccharide-bound SA and protein-bound SA in EBN by HPLC was established, and the extraction process of free and oligosaccharide-bound SA was optimized. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2021.										2022	105	2	567	575	1060-3271				10.1093/jaoacint/qsab096					FSTA:2022-08-Sp4537

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The application of 3D printing in the food field has received a lot of attention, and 3D printing can be used to make food that is easy to chew. Steamed buns are a traditional Chinese food, and no one has yet used 3D printing to make easy-to-swallow buns. In this study, rice flour and yeast were added to flour to improve its printing properties and textural properties, the effects of water addition on these properties were also studied. According to the results of preliminary exploration, a response surface with chewiness and cohesiveness as the response values was designed. When the water content was 64%, the addition of rice flour was 25%, and the addition of yeast was 0.36%, the chewiness of the optimal solution was 4.941N and cohesiveness was 0.66, which were considered acceptable. It provides a new idea for developing steamed buns that meet the needs of various groups of people. Novelty impact statement. As a traditional Chinese food, the commercial value of steamed buns is gradually increasing. The steamed buns made by 3D printing were similar in shape to traditional steamed buns but smaller and easier to chew and swallow. It can be considered easy-to-swallow food. This study also provides new ideas for the development of easy-to-swallow foods. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.17016					FSTA:2023-03-Mq1957

Showed with the addition of SPLP, height/diameter ratio increased from 0.44 to 0.96, specific volume decreased from 2.44 to 1.47, color changed from white to dark green, and hardness, gumminess, and chewiness ascended gradually; the contents of protein, fat, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamin B2, and niacin increased significantly, in particular, the polyphenol content increased from 1.34 to 9.34 mg chlorogenic acid equivalent/g DW, and the antioxidant activity increased from 1286.08 to 5650.77 mug ascorbic acid equivalent/g DW; the carbohydrate content decreased from 77.60 to 71.50 g/100 g DW, and the estimated glycemic index decreased from 95.25 to 87.51. The steamed breads with 2%-10% SPLP were overall acceptable. In conclusion, adding appropriate quantity of SPLP to wheat flour will not only maintain the technological quality but also improve the nutritional value of steamed bread. Practical applications. In recent years, the effective development and utilization of sweet potato leaf (SPL) has become an urgent problem to be solved. The nutritive value of traditional wheat steamed bread are often difficult to meet the daily health needs of human beings. SPL is known to be a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds.

Journal of Food Science					Fermentation strains play a key role in the quality of bread. The combination of yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may effectively improve the function and nutritional properties of bread. In this study, the dough was fermented to make bread by using single strain (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mode A), the combination of two strains (S. cerevisiae and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, mode B; S. cerevisiae and Lactobacillus delbrueckii, mode C), or three strains (S. cerevisiae, L. plantarum, and L. delbrueckii, mode D). The specific volume, texture, and aroma substances of bread were evaluated. The possibility of mixed fermentation of selected yeast and LAB to replace natural fermentation dough was evaluated. The results showed that the specific volume of bread in mode B was 15.2% higher than that of mode A. The structure was softer and the taste was more vigorous in mode B bread. The content of volatile compounds was highest in mode B bread among the four mode bread. The characteristic flavors were ethyl 2-hydroxypropionate and z-3-hexenol. The cofermentation in mode B made the bread aroma richer and gave better aroma characteristics to bread. Therefore, the fermentation of S. cerevisiae and L. plantarum can be recommended to replace naturally fermented dough to improve the quality of bread. Practical Application. L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii, separately or together, assisted in yeast fermentation to make bread. The specific volume, texture, and aroma substances of bread were evaluated to replace natural fermented dough with mixed fermentation. L. plantarum-assisted yeast fermentation improved the specific volume, texture, and aroma of bread. The characteristic flavors were ethyl 2-hydroxypropionate and z-3-hexenol in bread. Therefore, the fermentation of S. cerevisiae and L. plantarum could replace naturally fermented dough to improve the quality of bread. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	4	1823	1836	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16082					FSTA:2022-07-Mn4380

Journal of Food Science					In this study, gradient ethanol precipitation method was applied to obtain the extracellular polysaccharides of Lactobacillus paracasei VL8 (VL8-EPS). The yields, physicochemical properties, and immunomodulatory effects of VL8-EPS obtained by precipitation at different ethanol concentrations (30%, 50%, and 70%, v/v) were compared. The results showed that VL8-EPSs were high molecular weight sulfated heteropolysaccharides, composed mainly of glucose and galactose, and the alteration of ethanol concentration had an effect on their chemical compositions, molecular weight distributions, monosaccharide composition, and surface structure, while the primary structure remained the same. Among the three polysaccharide fractions, VL8-EPS50 displayed better immunomodulatory activities compared with VL8-EPS30 and VL8-EPS70. VL8-EPS50 was found to exert immunomodulatory effects by enhancing the phagocytic activity of RAW264.7 cells and to promote their secretion of more nitric oxide; it also showed stronger thermal and solution stability. In summary, there was a correlation between the structural characteristics of polysaccharides and their immunomodulatory activity, and VL8-EPS50 was preferentially used for in vivo immunomodulatory activity. Practical application. This study opens up the source of raw materials for functional foods, which can provide some theoretical basis for the research and development of extracellular polysaccharides of lactic acid bacteria and promote their application in the future development of food industry. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	5	2034	2047	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16153					FSTA:2022-08-Ad14284

Food & Function					In this study, the structure of Siraitia grosvenorii polysaccharides (SGPs) changed significantly after digestion. After 48 h of in vitro fecal fermentation, Mw decreased and the content of CR showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing. The monosaccharide composition (glucose) of SGPs showed a trend of decreasing and then stabilizing during fecal fermentation, indicating that SGPs were partially degraded during in vitro fermentation and significantly degraded and utilized by the human intestinal microbiota. In addition, SGPs fermentation for 48 h increased the production of SCFAs especially acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid. Moreover, after in vitro digestion and enzymatic digestion, the in vitro hypoglycemic activity of SGPs remained relatively high afterward, albeit reduced. This study contributes to a better understanding of the potential digestion and enzymatic mechanisms of SGP, which is important for the future development of SGP as a functional food and drug. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	18	9443	9458	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01776h					FSTA:2023-01-Jg1041
J		Yuxi Guo; Xuefeng Chen; Pin Gong; Mengrao Wang; Wenbo Yao; Wenjuan Yang; Fuxin Chen							Effects of simulated saliva-gastrointestinal digestion on the physicochemical properties and bioactivities of Siraitia grosvenorii polysaccharides.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of simulated saliva-gastric digestion (SGID) on the physicochemical properties and bioactivity of Siraitia grosvenorii polysaccharides (SGPs). The results revealed that the digestibility (bioavailability) of SGPs was approximately 16.81%, 43.86%, and 52.38% after saliva digestion (SD), saliva-gastric digestion (SGD), and SGID, respectively. SGID significantly altered the physicochemical properties of SGPs, such as total polysaccharide content (from 88.25% to 69.26%) and molecular weight (from 23.00 to 7.82). The structure of SGPs was significantly altered after digestion. In addition, SGID affected the biological activity of SGPs. After SGID, SGPs still had strong antioxidant activity, as well as alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase inhibition, and cellular hypoglycemic activity. However, the ability to bind bile acids and cholesterol in vitro was not affected. In conclusion, these results could provide a theoretical basis for investigating the mechanism of action of SGPs during digestion in vivo. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	7	4495	4506	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15783					FSTA:2022-10-Tb4200

Food Research International					1-Octen-3-ol makes an important contribution to meat flavor. The goal of this study was to identify the metabolic pathways of 1-octen-3-ol formation in meat. We found 218 metabolites associated with 1-octen-3-ol content in 20 samples of chicken meat, including mevalonic acid (positive correlation), corticosterone (negative correlation), and other lipids and lipid-like molecules. Among these 218 metabolites, 17 metabolites were differentially expressed in different 1-octen-3-ol content groups. Similarly, 37 genes were not only differentially expressed, but were significantly correlated with 1-octen-3-ol. The regulation of HSP90AA1, PTPN9, and other genes converted more mevalonic acid to 1-octen-3-ol. Meanwhile, mevalonic acid, a key material in the synthesis of cholesterol, caused a decrease in corticosterone content, affecting ZNF414 and KLF15 gene expression. These findings reveal the effect of cholesterol on 1-octen-3-ol content, as well as a positive regulation of mevalonic acid on the production of 1-octen-3-ol in chicken meat.

The consumer market is huge and the demand is wide. However, the formation mechanism of bread baking flavor has not been completely defined. In order to improve the breadmaking process and the quality of bread, the main flavor substances produced in bread baking, the formation mechanism, and the detection technology of bread baking flavor are carefully summarized in this paper.

J		Yuxia Zhang; Yajun Zhou							Formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines in spiced pork shoulder: effects of heat treatment parameters and number of soup cycles.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Spiced pork shoulder is a traditional Chinese meat product that is produced by long-term stewing in recycled soup. This study investigated the effects of cooking temperature, cooking time and number of soup cycles on the formation of heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in spiced pork shoulder. The main HAAs found in spiced pork shoulder was beta-carboline. When the cooking temperature rose from 70 °C to 100 °C, the total HAAs increased from 27.171.76 ng/g to 42.370.91 ng/g. When the cooking time was extended from 1 h to 4 h, the total HAAs increased by 50.23%. When the number of soup cycles was 15, the total HAAs in the meat and soup were 40.690.28 ng/g and 55.841.51 ng/g, respectively. Recycling soup may contribute greatly to the contents of HAAs in spiced pork shoulders. The high levels of HAAs in spiced pork shoulders were mainly from the adsorption of the HAAs in the soup onto the surface of the meat and their penetration into the meat. We recommend lowering the cooking temperature and shortening the cooking time to reduce the formation of HAAs in spiced pork shoulder. In addition, it is necessary to study effective methods to inhibit the formation of HAAs in soup.

J		Yuxia Zhu; Zengqi Peng; Junjun Wu; Yawei Zhang							Stability of oil-in-water emulsions with eggplant flesh pulp (Solanum melongena L.) emulsifier: effects of storage time, pH, ionic strength, and temperature.		Journal of Food Science					In this study, we investigated the stability of oil-in-water emulsions prepared using eggplant flesh pulp (EFP) as natural emulsifier. The effects of time and environmental stresses on the stability of emulsions with different EFP concentrations were evaluated using the creaming indices (CIs), particle sizes, and zeta potentials of the emulsions. The emulsions with EFP concentrations of up to 1.50% remained stable for at least 90 days. The CIs, mean particle diameters (MPDs] d3,2]), and zeta potentials of the emulsions with adequate EFP concentrations remained unchanged in the pH range of 3-9. Microstructure observations revealed that flocculation occurred for the emulsion with an EFP concentration of 1.50% at pH 3, whereas flocculation and coalescence occurred in the emulsion with a low EFP concentration of 0.50%. Upon increasing the concentration of NaCl from 0 to 0.5 M, the MPDs (d3,2) of the emulsions with EFP concentrations of 1.00% and 1.50% remained nearly constant (57 and 48 m, respectively). Moreover, the MPDs (d3,2) and zeta potentials of the emulsions with EFP concentrations of 1.00% and 1.50% did not change significantly upon increasing temperature from 4 to 100 °C. Hence, the emulsions with adequate EFP concentrations presented long storage times and were stable under various environmental stresses. Our results indicate that EFP is an effective and inexpensive emulsifier that can confer emulsions long-term storage stability and good resistance to environmental stresses. Practical Application. Eggplant, which is a common crop, is a rich source of natural materials. In this study, eggplant flesh pulp (EFP) was prepared via mechanical homogenization and its emulsifying properties for oil-in-water emulsions were evaluated. Our results demonstrated that the EFP-stabilized oil-in-water emulsions featured long storage times and were stable under environmental stresses (pH, ionic strength, and temperature). These properties render EFP-stabilized emulsions suitable as delivery systems for encapsulating and releasing nonpolar active ingredients in food products. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	3	1119	1133	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16046					FSTA:2022-06-Ae10606

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In order to better understand the impact of heating temperature on volatiles forming during linoleic acid heating process, volatile profiling was investigated by using thermal-desorption cryo-trapping combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. As a result, a total of 42 volatile compounds were detected and identified during this process, including aldehydes (12), ketones (6), alcohols (5), furans (6) acids (10), and aromatic compounds (3). The forming temperature of each volatile was determined. It reveals most volatiles with shorter carbon chains were generated at lower temperatures, while volatiles with longer carbon chains were generated at higher temperatures. Simultaneously, principal component analysis was used to analyze the volatile composition characteristics of linoleic acid at each temperature points. Results show volatile characteristics of linoleic acid had a big difference among different temperatures. One conclusion was drawn the volatile compound formation from linoleic acid is a temperature-dependent reaction rather than a time-dependent one during heating. Novelty impact statement. Thermal desorption combined with GC-MS could be an effective method for studying the volatile compounds forming mechanism of linoleic acid during heating. Temperature plays a crucial role in the heating process. Volatile compound formation from linoleic acid is a temperature-dependent reaction rather than a time-dependent one during heating. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16445					FSTA:2022-07-Aj12917

Antidiabetic effects of multi-species probiotic and its fermented milk in mice via restoring gut microbiota and intestinal barrier.		Food Bioscience					Probiotic is a promising nutritional intervention for the prevention and alleviation of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). In this study, the remission potential of a multi-species probiotic (Lactobacillus acidophilus NCFM, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium lactis HN019 and Streptococcus thermophilus ST447) and its fermented yoghurt on the symptoms of high fat diet and streptozotocin induced T2DM mice were investigated, and the underlying mechanisms were elucidated. Multi-species probiotic and probiotic yoghurt elicited similar but varying efficacy in decreasing the body weight loss, improving organ weight, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, regulating the levels of blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin and lipid as well as protecting the pancreatic islets. Their tangible antidiabetic effects may be ascribed to the mutual promotion between the repair of the intestinal barrier/permeability and the optimization of gut microbiota structure. Furthermore, the intestinal flora-short chain fatty acids-intestinal hormones/inflammatory pathway was activated and thereby conferring healthy benefits to the host. This proposed probiotic combination appears to provide a viable approach to alleviate T2DM.

In present study, nineteen-month-old mice received yeast protein (1.0 g/kg/d) for three months by gavage. Histological and ultrasonographical improvements in muscle as well as an increase in myofiber size were observed after yeast protein supplementation. Moreover, yeast protein activated Akt/mTOR/4E-BP1 pathway and regulated myogenic regulatory factors (Myog, Myf4, Myf5, and Myod1) to promote muscle protein synthesis and muscle regeneration and differentiation. Meanwhile, alpha and beta diversities as well as the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes were elevated after yeast protein supplementation. Changes in the abundance of gut microbiota after yeast protein supplementation were significantly correlated with glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism, closely involved in the process of muscle aging. Hence, yeast protein supplementation could contribute to ameliorating muscle aging, which may be associated with gut microbiota.

J		Yuxiao Mao; Yujun Hao; Xiangyu Guan; Penghao Wang; Shaojin Wang							Temperature and moisture dependent dielectric and thermal properties of walnut components associated with radio frequency and microwave pasteurization.		Foods					To provide necessary information for further pasteurization experiments and computer simulations based on radio frequency (RF) and microwave (MW) energy, dielectric and thermal properties of walnut components were measured at frequencies between 10 and 3000 MHz, temperatures between 20 and 80°C, and moisture contents of whole walnuts between 8.04% and 20.01% on a dry basis (d.b.). Results demonstrated that dielectric constants and loss factors of walnut kernels and shells decreased dramatically with raised frequency within the RF range from 10 to 300 MHz, but then reduced slightly within the MW range from 300 to 3000 MHz. Dielectric constant, loss factor, specific heat capacity, and thermal conductivity increased with raised temperature and moisture content. Dielectric loss factors of kernels were greater than those of shells, leading to a higher RF or MW heating rate. Penetration depth of electromagnetic waves in walnut components was found to be greater at lower frequencies, temperatures, and moisture contents. The established regression models with experimental results could predict both dielectric and thermal properties with large coefficients of determination (R2> 0.966). Therefore, this study offered essential data and effective guidance in developing and optimizing RF and MW pasteurization techniques for walnuts using both experiments and mathematical simulations. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Research International					Bee pollen as a plant-derived food is consumed as nutritional/functional supplements by humans. But it might confer foodborne allergenicity in susceptible populations, limiting its extensive application. In this study, five potential allergens including profilin, cystatin, prolamin, expansin, and alcohol dehydrogenase in bee pollen derived from Brassica campestris (BP-Bc), were identified through mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. Moreover, different types of enzymes (cellulases, pectases, and papains) serve biological roles in pollen wall breaking and expansion, but also promote allergen release and degradation. Proteomic analysis showed that profilin, cystatin, and alcohol dehydrogenase were significantly reduced in BP-Bc following joint treatment with three enzymes. Metabolomic characterization of potential enzymatic hydrolysates of these significantly-decreased allergens was performed, which showed nine major oligopeptides and six amino acids at significantly higher levels in the enzyme-treated BP-Bc. These findings clarified the culprit responsible for bee pollen allergy and the mechanism of enzymatic desensitization for its further development.

Food Research International					To better understand the global changes of amino acid catabolism and anabolism in broccoli in response to high O2 stress, iTRAQ-based proteomics combined with amino acid analysis was used to investigate the broccoli proteome at 0 and 4 d after treatment with different O2 concentrations (5% O2 + 5% CO2, 20% O2 + 5% CO2 and 40% O2 + 5% CO2) at 20°C. A total of 106 proteins with changes ≥ 1.2-fold in abundance were observed. Amino acid anabolism was significantly suppressed by high O2 stress, while catabolism was enhanced. High O2 stress-induced amino acid metabolism promoted the conversion of Met to ethylene and the degradation of amino acids to intermediate metabolites of the TCA cycle, thereby suppressing glucosinolate biosynthesis. However, the up-regulation of arginase and urease induced by high O2 stress aggravated ammonium toxicity. These findings enhance our understanding of high O2 stress-induced amino acid metabolism, as well as the effects of amino acid metabolism on broccoli senescence.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Yellowing is always accompanied by chlorophyll degradation and carotenoid accumulation, which is an important indicator for evaluating the quality and commercial value of postharvest broccoli. Elevated CO2 treatment was applied in broccoli heads to investigate its effect and mechanism on pigment metabolism. The results demonstrated that 30% CO2 treatment maintained higher nutritional quality by increasing phenols and flavonoids contents and delayed the yellowing by alleviating chlorophyll loss and carotenoid accumulation. The chlorophyll molecule could also be continuously synthesized in postharvest broccoli. The up-regulation of chlorophyll synthesis genes (BoMCase, BoChlM, BoChlE, BoPOR, BoDVR and BoChlG) and chlorophyll combination genes (BoCAB1 and BoCAB2) and the down-regulation of chlorophyll degradation genes (BoSGR1, BoNYC1, BoPPH, BoPAO and BoRCCR) were observed in postharvest broccoli treated with 30% CO2. Additionally, 30% CO2 treatment down-regulated the expression of BoPSY, BoLCYB, BoCHYB and BoVDE, thereby inhibiting zeaxanthin and beta-carotene biosynthesis. This study provided new insights into chlorophyll biosynthesis after harvest and the regulation of elevated CO2 on pigment metabolism in postharvest broccoli.

Journal of Functional Foods					Rich in abundant polyphenols and dietary fiber, blueberry pomace is still a potential material for gut health. This study aimed to reuse blueberry pomace by lactic acid bacteria fermentation and evaluate the colonic barrier-improving functions of Lactobacillus casei-fermented blueberry pomace (FBP). Male C57BL/6 mice were fed with control or high fat diets. The changes of oxidative stress, inflammation, microbiota, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), SCFAs receptors and barrier-related proteins in mice colon were evaluated. FBP attenuated the high fat diet-induced oxidative and inflammatory status in colon. Abundance of Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Akkermansia and butyrate-producing bacteria, SCFAs concentration, expression of SCFAs receptors and regulation of barrier-related proteins in high fat diet mice were elevated through supplying FBP. These FBP-associated beneficial changes in high fat diet mice were mediated by the MAPK-NF-kappaB-MLCK signaling pathway. FBP shows colonic barrier-improving functions in high fat diet mice.

Food & Function					Selenium levels have a critical impact on livestock and poultry, and selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have shown significant efficiency in supplementation. This study identified a high-efficiency selenite reductase, SerV01, in Staphylococcus aureus LZ-01, which can convert Se2O32- to SeNPs. Subsequently, SerV01 was introduced into the intestines of the broilers using the surface display-engineered E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN). The results showed that the engineered bacteria (EcN-IS) significantly increased the selenium content by 0.87mg kg-1, 0.52mg kg-1, and 6.10mg L-1 in the liver, breast muscle, and serum, respectively. With SeNPs + EcN-IS treatment, glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase levels reached 0.7536 0.03176 U muL-1 protein and 2.463 0.1685 U muL-1 protein, respectively. With the modified probiotics, the proportion of beneficial intestinal flora increased, with LactobacillusandPropionibacteriumaccounting for 75.85% and 0.19%. This technology provides a novel idea to facilitate the exploitation of selenium in broiler diets and improve antioxidant capability. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	8	4537	4550	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00206j					FSTA:2022-08-Sn4069
J		Yuxin Jia; Hui Guo; Xizhen Cheng; Yuling Zhang; Mingdong Si; Jing Shi; Donglai Ma							Hesperidin protects against cisplatin-induced cardiotoxicity in mice by regulating the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 pathway.		Food & Function					Hesperidin (HES) is an abundant and economical dietary bioflavonoid, and it has several pharmacological properties such as antioxidant activity and powerful cardiac protection. However, HES protection against cisplatin (CP)-induced cardiotoxicity and its mechanism have not been fully clarified. The current study was performed to further elucidate the mechanism of HES against CP-induced cardiotoxicity. Mice were orally administered HES (100 or 300mg kg-1 day-1) for 7 consecutive days and then injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with CP (5mg kg-1) on days 3 and 6. On day 8, mice were anaesthetised with sodium pentobarbital (50mg kg-1, i.p.), and blood and heart samples were collected for analysis. HES treatment reduced CP-induced cardiac pathologic damage and leakage of the myocardial markers cardiac troponin I (cTnI), creatine kinase (CK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). HES treatment reduced levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), which is an oxidative product, and increased antioxidant marker levels including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione (GSH). HES also reduced the CP-induced release of the inflammatory factors tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-6. Additionally, HES treatment up-regulated the expression of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and down-regulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and Caspase-3. HES treatment also improved the expression of pathway proteins p62 and Nrf2 and inhibited the increase in CP-induced Keap1 expression. Thus, HES may provide protection against CP cardiotoxicity through inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, which may contribute to activation of the p62-Keap1-Nrf2 signalling pathway. These findings suggest that HES may be a promising protective agent against CP cardiotoxicity in future anticancer clinical practice. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	7	4205	4215	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00298a					FSTA:2022-07-Aj12703
J		Yuxin Ma; Yun Ma; Zhe Yu; Bor-Sen Chiou; Fei Liu; Fang Zhong							Calcium spraying for fabricating collagen-alginate composite films with excellent wet mechanical properties.		Food Hydrocolloids					Two spray processes for adding calcium were designed to improve the mechanical properties of collagen fiber films in wet conditions. The processes were applied after immersion of the films in sodium alginate (SA) and glycerol solution. One process (P1) involved spraying after immersion but before but before the film had dried the film and the other process (P2) involved spraying after drying the film. Both processes significantly improved the wet mechanical properties of the films. However, P1 mainly enhanced the elasticity and stiffness, whereas P2 mainly enhanced the toughness. Ca-alginate complexes gradually formed in the samples after the addition of Ca2+, improving the water resistance of the samples. For the samples prepared using P1, Ca2+ penetrated inside the film and chelated SA and collagens to form a dense network, but further damaged the triple helix structures of collagens. For the samples prepared using P2, the sprayed calcium ions generated a protective layer of calcium alginate on the surface of the membrane and the secondary structure of the collagen was better maintained.

J		Yuxin Wang; Man He; Beibei Chen; Huiming Cao; Yong Liang; Bin Hu							Porous organic framework as coating for stir bar sorptive extraction of carbamate pesticides from corn and potato samples.		Food Chemistry					Three porous organic frameworks (POFs) were synthesized by the reaction between phloroglucinol and 1,4-phthalaldehyde, 4,4′-biphenyldialdehyde or tris-(4-formylphenyl) amine; the products are named as POF-a, POF-b and POF-c, respectively. They were used to prepare POFs coated stir bars respectively for the extraction of four carbamate pesticides (CMPs). POF-c coated stir bar exhibited better adsorption performance than POF-a/b coated stir bar and commercial stir bars, probably due to the stronger conjugated structure and hydrophobicity of POF-c, and resultant hydrophobic, pi-pi and hydrogen bonding interactions between them. The adsorption mechanism for target CMPs was verified by characterization techniques and molecular dynamics simulation. A method of POF-c coated stir bar sorptive extraction-high performance liquid chromatography-variable wavelength ultraviolet detector was developed for the analysis of four CMPs in corn and potato samples. Under the optimal conditions, LODs of the method were between 0.017 and 0.048mug/L, and the linear range for four CMPs was 0.1/0.2-200mug/L.

Food Bioscience					Huidouba is a kind of fungus plant that grows by spiders parasitizing tea trees at an altitude of 1500m above Mount Emei. The bioactive polysaccharides extracted from Huidouba have been traditionally used in the treatment of diabetes in China. In this study, the optimal hot-water extraction condition of crude Huidouba polysaccharides was obtained using Box-Behnken design: the temperature of 93.7°C, the time of 3.57 h, the liquid-to-solid ratio of 28.47mL/g, and the yield was 0.46%. Three purified Huidouba polysaccharides (HDBPs, including HDBP-d, HDBP-1, and HDBP-2) were separated through deproteinization, ultrafiltration, and column chromatography. Then the inhibition mechanism and kinetics of HDBPs against alpha-glucosidase were investigated. The inhibitory activity of HDBPs on alpha-glucosidase was positively correlated with their concentration, and their mechanism of quenching fluorescence was ascertained to be the static type induced by the formation of HDBPs-alpha-glucosidase complex. HDBP-d and HDBP-2 inhibited the activity of alpha-glucosidase in a reversible competitive-type manner while HDBP-1 was a noncompetitive-type inhibitor. The inhibitory activities of HDBPs on alpha-glucosidase correlated inversely with temperature in most cases, and showed weaker inhibitory activity at extreme acidic or alkaline conditions. These findings highlight the efficacy, kinetics and mechanism of HDBPs inhibiting alpha-glucosidase in vitro. The study provided a replaceable approach for chemical inhibitors of alpha-glucosidase with natural fungus plant extracts, and suggested the theoretical basis that the plant-derived polysaccharides with glucosidase inhibition effects were applied in medicines.

Food & Function					A number of studies demonstrated that some tea extracts exert inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL). However, the effect of purple tea, a famous tea in China, on osteoclastogenesis remains unclear. In this study, a water-based purple tea extract (PTE) was found to suppress osteoclast formation, osteoclastic resorption pit area formation, and F-actin ring formation within RANKL-stimulated bone marrow macrophages (BMMs). Furthermore, our results demonstrated that PTE could inhibit expression of master transcription factors NFATc1 and c-Fos and their target genes DC-STAMP, Ctsk, and Atp6v0d2. Western blot analysis revealed that PTE treatment led to reduced RANKL-induced phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3beta without altering transient activation of NF-kappaB and MAPKs (p38, JNK, ERK1/2) signaling. In addition, the results demonstrated that PTE treatment of RANKL-stimulated BMMs could down-regulate Blimp1 expression and up-regulate Irf8 expression. In summary, these results suggest that PTE treatment of RANKL-stimulated BMMs inhibited osteoclast differentiation via modulation of Blimp1-Irf8 and Akt/GSK3beta signaling pathways. Aligning with our in vitro results, in vivo PTE administration ameliorated bone loss in LPS-treated mice. Taken together, the results presented in this work suggest that PTE treatment possesses anti-osteolytic activity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	17	8850	8859	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00780k					FSTA:2022-12-Hn11366
J		Yuxiu Wen; Sheng Zhou; Liqian Wang; Qi Li; Yuan Gao; Xiuzhu Yu							New method for the determination of the induction period of walnut oil by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.		Food Analytical Methods					2019A new method for the determination of the induction period (IP) of walnut oil through polyethylene-film-based Fourier transform infrared (PE-FTIR) spectroscopy was developed. The IP value was used to represent the oxidation stability of walnut oil. The characteristic infrared spectrum peaks at 3008,1654, 914, and 723cm-1 changed significantly as the IP value decreased. The prediction model was established on the basis of these changes. The optimal partial least squares model was established under the following conditions: constant, original spectra, no smoothing, and wavelength range of 1640-440cm-1. The calibration set of the model provided a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9847 and a root mean error of calibration of 3.38. The R2 and the root mean square error of prediction for the validation set were 0.9878 and 2.32, respectively, and were 0.9948 and 3.61 for the blind sample validation set, respectively. In precision evaluation, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation of the predicted values were 4.13 and 4.19%, respectively. The present results indicated that the polyethylene-FTIR method for analyzing the IP value of walnut oil was simple and rapid and could be used as a highly effective alternative to the traditional determination method. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	3	833	843	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02170-6					FSTA:2022-12-Ne2890

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					We evaluated the effects of different oxidation levels of lipids on protein degradation and biogenic amines (BAs) formation during Sichuan-style sausages processing. Lipids with varying degrees of oxidation were obtained through storage at different temperatures and added as raw materials of Sichuan-style sausages, followed by the analyses of lipid oxidation, protein degradation, biogenic amine content, and other indicators. During the processing, with increasing degree of lipid oxidation, the contents of peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs), protein degradation index (PI), amino acid nitrogen (AAN), free amino acids (FAAs), and BAs increased. Based on the protein electrophoresis results, the higher the oxidation degree of pig backfat, the higher degree of sarcoplasmic protein oxidation, and the greater myofibril protein degradation. Pearson correlation revealed that lipid oxidation, protein degradation, and BAs content correlated significantly (P< 0.05).

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The study was conducted to understand the effect of zein-gum Arabic (GA) complex coacervates prepared by ultrasound treatment on the encapsulation of resveratrol. Compared with zein, zein-GA complex coacervation largely increased the encapsulation efficiency from 26.19% to 55.85% and it was further increased to 74.2% after sonication. Also, prominent rise in the related loading capacities from 2.79% to 6.01% was noted. The increased particle size by the addition of GA and polydispersity index of the ternary complex was dramatically reduced after ultrasound treatment; the absolute values of zeta potential were increased. The hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions and hydrophobic effects were the main driving forces for the formation of the ternary complex particles. Ultrasound treatment strengthened the hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions, resulting in the formation of compact and homogeneous composite nanoparticles with smaller particle size, which was further confirmed by scanning electron microscope and atomic force microscope. These findings reveal the mechanism of ultrasound enhancing the zein-GA complex coacervation to load resveratrol, and demonstrate its promising effect in modifying protein-polysaccharide complex coacervation as a delivery carrier in the functional food and beverage industry.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the combination of citrus fibre (CF) and soy protein isolate (SPI) on pork myofibrillar protein (MP) gel properties under low-sodium salt conditions during the heating process. The composite (with CF and SPI) and single (with 1% and 2% NaCl) MP gels properties were evaluated by colour, water holding capacity (WHC), gel strength, rheological properties, microstructure, secondary structure, and water state. The addition of 0.45% CF and 1.5% SPI significantly improved WHC and gel strength, as well as increased the values of G′ and G′′ (P<0.05). The microstructure indicated that the CF/SPI could decrease the water channels and form a denser structure through filling effects, which was also proved by the fast T21 relaxation time. However, the addition of 0.9% CF and 3.0% SPI could inhibit the protein aggregation and disrupt the stable and homogeneous structure. The analysis of the secondary structure showed that the CF/SPI resulted in a lower alpha-helix content and a higher beta-sheet content compared with MP gels. This study may provide some guidance for the use of CF/SPI to improve MP gel properties in low-salt meat products. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	12	7701	7711	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16121					FSTA:2023-03-Sj1776

Food Chemistry					The changes in digestibility of TG-treated myofibrillar protein (MP), soybean protein isolate (SPI) and mixed proteins were evaluated by measuring liberation of primary amino groups, monitoring structural changes and investigating peptide fingerprints. TG treatment generally increased gastric digestion of treated proteins, possibly due to the structural changes occurred during TG treatment. In contrast, the initial intestinal digestion was suppressed by TG treatment. Compared with MP, the digestibility and peptide composition of SPI were affected by TG treatment to a larger degree, possibly due to the higher level of glutamine in SPI. Peptidomics analysis indicated that the changes in peptide composition of digests of TG-treated samples were related with the loss of Lys residues during TG treatment. Larger quantities of bioactive peptides KIEFEQFLPM, EVHEPEEKPRPK and TVKEDQVFPMNPPK were released after digestion of TG-treated MP. These results highlighted the complex and substantial influence of TG treatment on the digestibility of dietary proteins.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					To investigate whether the ultrasonic pre-treatments of starch will affect the octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA) esterification, different power ultrasonic pre-treatments (150, 300, 450 and 600 W) were performed on potato starch, then the OSA esterification was performed and the physicochemical as well as the emulsifying properties of the OSA starch were analysed. Results indicated that ultrasonic pre-treatments decreased the degree of substitution and reaction efficiency by 30%, regardless of the pre-treatments condition, while little differences were observed in the crystalline type and the long-range ordered structure. DSC results demonstrated that low-power ultrasound decreased the values of To and Tp, but increased DeltaH, while high-power ultrasound had the opposite effect. In addition, high-power sonication improved the emulsifying capacity of OSA starch, which ranged from 189.08 0.23 m2/g to 334.70 0.35 m2/g, while emulsion stability decreased from 277.02 10.83 min to 42.75 0.08 min. Overall, the result of the present work implied that OSA starch exhibited varied thermal and emulsifying properties under different ultrasonic pre-treatments, and our work might provide basic theory for the preparation of OSA starch. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	11	7286	7295	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16080					FSTA:2023-02-Le0258
J		Yuyang Huang; Na Wang; Haitian Zhao							In vivo activities of the structured lipids -1,3-dioleic acid 2-palmitic acid triglyceride (OPO) in high-fat diet mice.		Food Bioscience					High-energy diets and lipid metabolism can lead to high levels of total cholesterol, a decrease in antioxidant, enzyme activity, and an increase in oxidative stress and dyslipidemia biomarker. In this study, the in vivo antihyperlipidemic and antioxidant effects of 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoyl triglyceride (OPO) using a high fat-diet model were investigated. The mice were divided into groups including high-fat model group (HF), auxiliary group (AG), positive Control group (PC), low OPO dose group (LO), medium OPO dose group (MO) and high OPO. OPO was administrated to 60 hyperlipidemia induced male Kunming mice at the dosage of 200, 400 and 800mg/kgd body weight, for 35 days. The results showed that the administration of OPO decreased the body weight from 43.92g in HF to 37.74g in HO group, liver index from 3.94% in HF to 3.43 in HO group and kidney index from 1.38 in HF % to 1.17% in HO group. The administration of OPO significantly decreased hyperlipidemia mice's serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels at P < 0.05. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased with reductions of visceral hypertrophy and fat accumulation in model mice. Furthermore, in the HO group, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase levels increased significantly by 27.39, 38.33 and 22.90% at (P < 0.05), respectively. OPO also significantly reduced the enzyme activity of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase in serum at P < 0.05.

Food Chemistry					A novel method of simultaneous extraction and separation of diverse polysaccharides from Purple-heart Radish was developed by integrating EAE with MAATPE. The effects of different enzymes, the ATPS composition, extraction temperature, time etc. Were investigated by single-factor experiments and RSM. Under the optimum conditions, the extraction yields of PTP, PBP and total polysaccharides were 9.107 0.391%, 32.506 0.046% and 41.613 0.437%, respectively. By means of HPGPC and PMP-HPLC, Mw of PTP and Mw of PBP were 15935 Da and 27962 Da, respectively. PTP and PBP were mainly composed of mannose, glucuronic acid, aminogalactose, glucose, galactose and arabinose. Moreover, both polysaccharides exhibited stronger antioxidant activities for scavenging multiple radicals and anti-lipid peroxidation. Compared to the conventional extraction methods, EAE-MAATPE achieved higher extraction efficiency due to the synergistic effect between EAE and MAATPE leading to rupture and enzymolysis of cell. Thus, EAE-MAATPE provided an efficient alternative to simultaneous extraction of different polysaccharides from natural products.

J		Yuyang Ma; Jinjin Xu; Suisui Jiang; Mingyong Zeng							Effect of chitosan coating on the properties of nanoliposomes loaded with oyster protein hydrolysates: stability during spray-drying and freeze-drying.		Food Chemistry					Oyster protein hydrolysate (OPH) has high bioactivity and excellent performance, but its application in food formulation is still limited due to poor flavor and instability. In the present study, OPH was prepared by enzymatic hydrolysis and loaded into nanoliposomes. Then, the effects of chitosan coating (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0%) on the physical properties, stability, and antioxidant activity were evaluated. The results showed that 1% chitosan-coated nanoliposomes had high encapsulation efficiency (EE) and physical stability. Additionally, chitosan coating slowed the release rate of nanoliposomes and increased the retention rate of antioxidant activity of OPH. The stability of the uncoated/coated nanoliposomes in a maltodextrin matrix by spray/freeze drying was evaluated. FTIR spectrum showed that hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic, and electrostatic interactions had been formed between chitosan-coated nanoliposomes and maltodextrin. Chitosan coating significantly improved the physical stability and antioxidant activity retention of nanoliposomes during powder reconstitution.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Oyster polysaccharides (OPS) have a variety of biological activities. In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of OPS to ameliorate hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation in mice induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). The results showed that OPS reduced the HFD-induced increases in serum transaminase levels and alleviated hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation. Moreover, OPS regulated bile acid metabolism and increased bile acid content in the liver, serum, and feces. Serum bile acid profile results indicated that OPS reduced levels of chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid associated with high-affinity agonists of Farnesol X receptor (FXR). Western blot analysis showed that OPS accelerated bile acid metabolism by downregulating hepatic FXR expression and promoting its downstream CYP7A1, CYP27A1, and CYP8B1 protein expression. Meanwhile, OPS ameliorated oxidative stress and inflammation in the liver by modulating FXR-AMPKalpha-Nrf2/NF-kappaB signaling to reduce p-IkappaBalpha/IkappaBalpha, p-NF-kappaB p65/NF-kappaB p65, IL-1beta, and TNF-alpha expression and increase p-Nrf2/Nrf2, HO-1, and NQO-1 expression. This study was the first to explore the possible mechanism of OPS in improving liver oxidative stress and inflammation from the perspective of bile acid metabolism, providing a theoretical basis for OPS as a new source of functional food.										2022	70	28	8662	8671	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02490					FSTA:2022-11-Re4804
J		Yuyang Ma; Yahui Wang; Suisui Jiang; Mingyong Zeng							Effect of gelatin on gelation properties of oyster (Crassostrea gigas) protein.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of gelatin on the formation of oyster protein gel and reveal the interaction mechanism between gelatin and oyster protein. In the present study, the oyster protein (OP100) was obtained after being high pressure homogenized (100 MPa) and subsequently reconstituted with different concentrations (0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0, and 8.0%) of gelatin. The rheological results showed that gelatin improved the storage modulus of OP100, and accelerated the gelation of OP100 during the cooling period. Moreover, gelatin improved the gel strength and texture properties of OP100. Infrared scanning indicated that new hydrogen bonds and beta-sheets structures had been formed between the OP100 and gelatin. Molecular force results showed that hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonds, and disulfide bonds were the main molecular forces of the OP100/gelatin composite gel. These results provide a new reference for developing oyster protein nutritional gel products and reveal that gelatin can improve the texture properties of oyster protein gel.

Food & Function					Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is one of the most prevalent pathogens globally, and long-term infection causes various gastrointestinal diseases such as gastritis and even cancer. In the present study, we screened dozens of lactic acid bacteria for the efficacy to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro, and tested the therapeutic effects of candidate strains in vivo. The results showed that Limosilactobacillus fermentum MN-LF23 (LF23) and Lactobacillus gasseri MN-LG80 (LG80) significantly reduced the abundance of Helicobacter by 90% and 83% in the infected mice, respectively, and decreased the levels of serum urease and H. pylori-specific IgG. Both bacterial strains tended to ameliorate H. pylori infection-induced gastric mucosa damage and lymphocyte infiltration, and reduced levels of serum inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6. In addition, their culture supernatants also showed a therapeutic effect, as efficient as the bacterial cells. Furthermore, both strains significantly regulated gastric microbiota profile, and their supernatants restored the diversity of gastric microbiota. LF23 increased the abundance of Lactobacillus murinus and reduced the abundance of Desulfovibrio, whereas LG80 increased the abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri and reduced the abundance of Bilophila. Both LF23 and LG80 enriched beneficial commensals such as Faecalibaculum rodentium, and reduced detrimental bacteria such as H. pylori and Lachnoclostridium. In conclusion, we identified two novel lactic acid bacteria L. fermentum MN-LF23 and L. gasseri MN-LG80 that can remarkably inhibit H. pylori infection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	21	11061	11069	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02034c					FSTA:2023-02-Ad3516
J		Yuyao Li; Zhichao Hu; Fengwei Gu; Jiali Fan; Bing Wang; Feng Wu; Hongguang Yang							An experimental study on the physical mechanics and collision characteristics of potato tubers in different haulm removal times.		International Journal of Food Properties					Most potato harvesting in China requires haulm removal. The properties of the tubers change after haulm removal. Investigating the effects of different haulm removal times on the physical mechanics and collision damage characteristics of potato tubers during the harvest period can provide a reference for reducing the damage rate of potato tubers during mechanical harvesting. The Longshu No. 7 potato, which is widely grown in northwest China, was selected as the experimental object in this study. The tuber parameters of the physical mechanics and collision damage characteristics for four different haulm removal dates (0, 7, 10 and 14 days before harvesting) were experimentally determined. The results showed that with the increase in haulm removal time before harvesting, the rupture pressure, Young's modulus, and shear modulus increased significantly. The coefficient of restitution decreased significantly. Additionally, when multiple potato tubers fell on the steel plate in the EDEM simulation test, the maximum force of a single tuber with the largest resultant force and the maximum contact force of all tubers were affected significantly. Both showed significant downward trends. The results of this study can provide a reference for discrete element simulation parameters related to potato harvesting machinery. It can also provide a reference for determining the time to haulm removal during the actual harvest. © 2022 Yuyao Li, Zhichao Hu, Fengwei Gu, Jiali Fan, Bing Wang, Feng Wu and Hongguang Yang.

Foods					The effect of antifreeze protein (AFP) on the water-holding capacity (WHC) and texture properties of the Patinopecten yessoensis adductor muscles during freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) were evaluated based on three impregnation methods: general impregnation (GI), vacuum impregnation (VI), and ultrasound-assisted VI (US-VI). The WHC, texture properties, and tissue microstructure were all evaluated. Results. Showed that the WHC and texture properties of adductor muscle were significantly improved in the VI and US-VI groups during FTCs (p< 0.05). The WHC of the adductor muscle in the US-VI group was maximally enhanced in terms of yield (6.63%), centrifugal loss, cooking loss, and T22. The US-VI group of the adductor muscle had the optimal chewiness and springiness compared to others, and the shear force and hardness were most effectively enhanced by VI. The growth and recrystallization of ice crystals in the frozen adductor muscle were significantly inhibited by VI and US-VI. The average cross-sectional area and roundness of ice crystals in the US-VI group were decreased by 61.89% and increased by 22.22% compared with those of the control, respectively. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model further confirmed that the WHC and texture properties of the adductor muscle were correlated appreciably with the degree of modification of ice crystal morphology through the AFP. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Yuyao Yuan; Jia Wei; Shijun Xing; Zheng Zhang; Bin Wu; Junfeng Guan							Sulfur dioxide (SO2) accumulation in postharvest grape: the role of pedicels of four different varieties.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Fumigation with sulfur dioxide (SO2) is the most common and effective treatment for maintaining the post-harvest quality and controlling storage disease in table grape. However, excessive accumulation of SO2 caused by improper use may result in berry discoloration or off-flavors. It remains unclear whether SO2 accumulation is related to the structure of the grape pedicel. Here, we used four varieties of table grapes to investigate the relationship between pedicel structure and SO2 accumulation in different parts of a grape cluster. The results showed that SO2 accumulation in the pedicels of different grape varieties was significantly higher than that in the rachises and berries. In pedicels, SO2 mainly diffused through the lenticels. Furthermore, the pedicel water content and lenticel area were closely related to the extent of SO2 accumulation. This study reveals the pathways for diffusion and the sites of SO2 accumulation in postharvest grapes after fumigation with SO2. Further, it provides a sound theoretical basis for studies related to SO2 accumulation in grapes.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Although exogenous and endogenous formaldehyde in squid has led to severe health threat, an in-depth study on natural edible scavengers for formaldehyde in squid is still lacking. Results. Response surface methodology (RSM) combined with experimental verification approaches was applied to obtain an optimal "recipe" to achieve formaldehyde removal rate of >85%: 6mgmL-1 tea polyphenols, 20mgmL-1 chitosan, 3:2 (v/v) tea polyphenols and chitosan, a pH value of 3 and 60min treatment time. Apart from the capability of removing formaldehyde, the scavenger derived from natural food exhibited a significant preservation effect (extension of preservation time up to 40%) on squid during chilled storage, and was safe and environmentally friendly. Meanwhile, a synergetic effect of the two components on scavenging formaldehyde was unraveled by multimolecular infrared spectroscopy. Conclusion. An edible and bifunctional reagent composed of tea polyphenols and chitosan was developed for simultaneously removing artificially added or endogenous formaldehyde and for preservation of squid. The bifunctional coating shows promise as a formaldehyde scavenger and green preservative for aquatic products. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	5	1958	1967	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11534					FSTA:2022-06-Re2412

Lactobacillus johnsonii enhances the gut barrier integrity via the interaction between GAPDH and the mouse tight junction protein JAM-2.		Food & Function					Commensal intestinal microbiota interacts with gut epithelial cells in the host by binding to specific host receptors. Several pattern recognition receptors on the gut that sense conserved microbial-associated molecular patterns have been reported; however, many of the gut receptor molecules involved in bacterial binding have not yet been identified. In this study, commensal intestinal bacteria interacting with mouse gut surface proteins were screened from fecal bacterial samples, to identify novel receptors on the epithelial cells in the mouse gut. Among the screened intestinal lactic acid bacteria, the frequently isolated Lactobacillus johnsonii MG was used for the purification of gut receptor proteins. An approximately 30 kDa protein was purified using affinity resin coupled surface layer proteins isolated from L. johnsonii MG. The purified gut protein was identified as a member of the tight junction protein family, junctional adhesion molecule-2 (JAM-2). As expected, the tight junctions of Caco-2 cells damaged by H2O2 were repaired by incubation with L. johnsonii MG. RNA sequence analysis showed significant upregulation of the expression of genes for tight junctions, anti-inflammatory effects, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis in Caco-2 cells, following L. johnsonii MG treatment. In L. johnsonii MG, the surface layer 40 kDa protein was purified with gut protein-coupled affinity resin and identified as the moonlighting protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). These results suggest that L. johnsonii MG promotes the barrier function integrity in Caco-2 cells via GAPDH-JAM-2 binding. Here, we propose a promising approach to identify novel gut receptor molecules based on commensal bacterial interactions and understand host-bacterial communication in a mouse model. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	21	11021	11033	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00886f					FSTA:2023-02-Aj3511

Food Chemistry					Whey protein-stabilized Pickering emulsion was incorporated with dextrin under different concentrations, and their physicochemical properties and in vitro digestive behavior were examined. The result showed that these emulsions were relatively stable at low dextrin addition (<7.5%), while droplet flocculation appeared at higher concentrations. With progressing dextrin, the apparent shear viscosity significantly increased from 1.7 to 7.3mPa.s. Further insight into the digestive behaviors of emulsion incorporated with dextrin was determined using a standardized INFOGEST method. Less clump in the oral phase and increasing droplet size in the initial intestine were observed in the emulsion incorporated with dextrin. Based on dextrin incorporation, a significant decrease in the extent of lipid digestion and beta-carotene bioaccessibility was presented. This study implies dextrin may be useful in controlling the texture and in vitro digestive behavior of Pickering emulsions, which may be advantageous for the designation of functional foods.

Food Chemistry					Potato starch spherulites (PSS) with different molecular weights were obtained by controlled enzymatic hydrolysis of potato amylose starch, followed by super-heated quenching treatment. The impact of enzymatic hydrolysis on mean particle diameter and molecular weight was observed, ranging from 355 to 57 nm. Structural and physicochemical characteristics of produced spherulites were determined using scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and rheological measurements. Rheological analysis indicated that PSS sample was viscoelastic with shear-thinning behavior. PSS was found to exhibit weak B-type crystallinity, similarly to that in native starch. PSS25% had a higher thermal stability with 128.5 °C melting temperature. Microstructure confirmed there were small spherulites (1-3 mum) formed with hydrolyzed amylose starch, and starch with 15% enzymatic-hydrolysis degree was more beneficial to develop spherulite. These results may be useful in development of starch-based functional ingredients applied in plant-based foods as fat replacers, structure formers, or delivery systems.

J.; Lufeng Wang							Insight of rheology, water distribution and in vitro digestive behavior of starch based-emulsion gel: impact of potato starch concentration.		Food Hydrocolloids					Potato starch-based emulsion gels were fabricated that consisted of whey protein-coated oil droplets dispersed in a gelatinized starch matrix. The impact of potato starch concentration (0-16%) on the rheological properties, water distribution, and in vitro digestive behavior of the emulsion gels was examined. Potato starch-based emulsion gels exhibited shear-thinning and viscoelastic properties. The apparent viscosity increased with progressing starch concentration, and a stronger gel network formed with massive starch. In low-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance, the transverse relaxation time significantly reduced with progressing starch matrix, indicating a tighter bond between the water molecules with others. The gastrointestinal tract was used to monitor the in vitro digestive behavior of the starch-based emulsion gels in each phase (oral, stomach, and small intestine). Increasing particle size and a reduction charge were found in emulsion gel with potato starch. And the gel network structure remained in emulsion gel with 8-16% potato starch. Overall, a slower rate of initial free fatty acid release was determined in the emulsion system containing starch, and a greater extent of lipid digestion occurred in the hard gel. The results of this study may facilitate the development of starch-based emulsion gels for utilization in foods, cosmetics, and other semi-solid commercial products.

J		Yuying Hu; Ben Yu; Lufeng Wang; McClements, D. J.; Chunmei Li							Study of dextrin addition on the formation and physicochemical properties of whey protein-stabilized emulsion: effect of dextrin molecular dimension.		Food Hydrocolloids					Oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion was prepared using whey protein as a natural emulsifier, and dextrin was incorporated with the emulsion formation. Dextrins with varying molecular dimensions (from 21.6 to 101.3 nm) were obtained by controlled enzymatic hydrolysis with alpha-amylase. The effects of molecular dimension of dextrin on the formation, stability, and physicochemical properties of the emulsions were then analyzed, by measuring their visual appearance, microstructure, particle size, zeta-potential, and rheological properties. Moreover, the environmental stress was assessed by temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The results indicated the presence of dextrin did not adversely affect the formation of small oil droplets during homogenization and the short-term stability of O/W emulsion. While in long-term storage, the emulsion with large dextrin and starch molecule was unstable to aggregate, and small dextrin could cooperate well in stabilizing the oil droplets in the emulsion system. A shear-thinning behavior was observed in all emulsions, and an increase in the emulsion viscosity (from 2.1 to 7.7 mPa.s) was examined with the addition of dextrin. Environmental stress of emulsion with low dimension dextrin was determined, indicating it was relatively thermal-stable. And some aggregations were found in emulsions near pH 4 and 5, as well as with NaCl addition. These results suggest that whey protein with low dimension dextrin addition may be a useful emulsifier for utilization within the food industry.

Food Chemistry					As a drug carrier, starch-based microparticle (SMP) has attracted widespread attention. However, because SMP is commonly formed in aqueous media, it is facing the challenge of encapsulation of hydrophobic bioactive. Here, we present an effective method for encapsulating fucoxanthin (Fx), a model hydrophobic bioactive, within SMP formed by self-assembly of short-chain glucans (SCG), using zein nanoparticles as intermediate vectors. SMP exhibited higher encapsulation efficiency to chitosan-coated Fx-zein nanoparticles (~91%) at a given concentration of 50mug/mL compared to soybean polysaccharide-coated ones. Fx in SMP was found to be more stable against UV radiation-induced degradation and FeCl3-catalyzed oxidative stresses than free Fx. Furthermore, SMP conferred controlled release of Fx in the duodenum (6%), jejunum (13%), ileum (32%), and colon (42%), implying that this approach could be useful in designing an effective drug carrier for delivering several hydrophobic bioactives to different parts of the intestine.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Hydrophilic beta-sitosterol sugar esters were synthesized by a two-step biocatalytic approach using beta-sitosterol vinyl adipate as an intermediate. The maximum conversion (above 90%) of beta-sitosterol vinyl adipate was achieved using the saccharides glucose, sucrose, and raffinose. The chemical structure of the synthesized esters was confirmed by various techniques. The investigation of physical properties revealed that beta-sitosterol sugar esters had enhanced water solubility (3.0-8.0 mM at 35°C), reduced crystallinity, and high wettability. Their lyotropic liquid crystal properties were observed by polarized light microscopy. Furthermore, beta-sitosterol sugar esters could be hydrolyzed into beta-sitosterol adipate under simulated intestinal conditions at a low rate (2.83-18.14%). Most beta-sitosterol sugar esters probably entered into intestinal bile salt micelles with ester bonds intact and showed up to 10-fold higher in vitro bioaccessibility than free beta-sitosterol in non-fat systems. The excellent physical and functional characteristics of beta-sitosterol sugar esters suggested their great potential application in the food industry.										2022	70	27	8458	8468	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01847					FSTA:2022-11-Aj21888

Journal of Food Science					Phytosterols have received an extensive attention owing to their excellent cholesterol-lowering activity and the role in cardiovascular diseases prevention. Phytosterol diacid monoesters, the important intermediates in the structural modification of free phytosterols, were usually obtained by chemical method with catalyst. The aim of this research was to provide an eco-friendly approach for the preparation of phytosterol diacid monoester and explore the possible mechanism of their hypocholesteremic effect using model bile mixed micelles. Catalyst-free synthesis of beta-sitosterol with succinic anhydride, maleic anhydride, and glutaric anhydride was investigated and optimized. The yields of three beta-sitosterol diacid monoesters all reached above 94% under optimum reaction conditions and their chemical structures were confirmed further by mass spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Compared with beta-sitosterol, beta-sitosterol diacid monoesters possessed the increased thermal stability (up to an above 355.28°C) and improved solubility in binary mixed micelle system (exceeding 1.7 mM) and similar cholesterol-lowering activity (7.78%-11.05%). Moreover, beta-sitosterol diacid monoesters showed the competitive effect on solubilization of cholesterol due to their enhanced micellar incorporation capacity. Overall, the competition with cholesterol in vitro gives useful information about the cholesterol-lowering activity of phytosterol diacid monoesters, which will further expand their applications in the food industry and health. Practical Application. Modified phytosterols, phytosterol diacid monoesters, were successfully synthesized in petroleum ether without catalyst. These products enhanced the thermal stability of free phytosterols and reduced the dissolution capacity of cholesterol in model bile mixed micelles due to competitive solubilization. These results indicated that phytosterol diacid monoesters represented cholesterol-lowering potential, which might further expand the applications in the food industry and health. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	3	1035	1046	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16074					FSTA:2022-06-Aj10612

Ethanol pretreatment increases the efficiency of maltogenic alpha-amylase and branching enzyme to modify the structure of granular native maize starch.		Food Hydrocolloids					A method for efficient functional modification of starch granules by thermal ethanol pre-treatment and subsequent maltogenic alpha-amylase (MA) and branching enzyme (BE) post-treatments is described. Ethanol pre-treatment significantly increased the swelling power of starch granules thereby increasing the MA and BE susceptibility. Ethanol pre-treated granules became shrunk and twisted after incubating in buffer. Sequential MA post-treatments remarkably increased the alpha-1,6 to alpha-1,4 ratio and the content of amylopectin short chains (DP 1-10), contributing to the low retrogradation rate. BE post-treatments significantly decreased the product yield, increased the relative crystallinity of starch granules, suggesting BE had intramolecular transglucosylation activity which altered the branch position and reduced the molecular size by forming cyclic structures. Moreover, BE post-treatments showed an alpha-1,6 to alpha-1,4 transglucosylation activity by decreasing the alpha-1,6 to alpha-1,4 ratio, especially during simultaneous MA and BE catalysis. However, in the simultaneous MA and BE post-catalysis, MA dosage was predominant by noticeably hydrolyzing amylopectin and amylose molecules and increasing the alpha-1,6 to alpha-1,4 ratio, thereby leading to the lowest digestibility and retrogradation.

Food Chemistry					Compared with P. longanae-infected longan, 2, 4-dinitrophenol (DNP) treatment for P. longanae-infected longan displayed the lower levels of pulp firmness, cell wall materials, ionic-soluble pectin, covalent-soluble pectin, hemicellulose, or cellulose, but the higher amount of water-soluble pectin, the higher activities of cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs) (PG, beta-Gal, PME, Cx, and XET), and the higher transcript levels of CWDEs-related genes (DlPG1, DlPG2, Dlbeta-Gal1, DlPME1, DlPME2, DlPME3, DlCx1, and DlXET30). On the contrary, ATP treatment for P. longanae-infected longan exhibited opposite effects. The above results imply that DNP accelerated P. longanae-induced pulp softening and breakdown of fresh longan, which was because DNP up-regulated the transcript levels of CWDEs-related genes, enhanced the CWDEs activities, and accelerated the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides (CWP). However, ATP suppressed longan pulp softening and breakdown caused by P. longanae, because ATP down-regulated the transcript levels of CWDEs-related genes, lowered the CWDEs activities, and reduced the CWP degradation.

Journal of Functional Foods					Tartary buckwheat is a popular natural grain commonly used as a functional food in various countries. This study aimed to prepare buckwheat dietary fiber with improved biological activity using liquid fermentation of Aspergillus niger and to elucidate its physicochemical properties and related mechanisms. Compared with unfermented buckwheat dietary fiber, Aspergillus niger fermentation increased the soluble dietary fiber content, thereby improving dietary fiber's physical and chemical properties such as water, oil retention capacity, and swelling cholesterol-binding capacity. Fermented Tartary buckwheat dietary fiber treatment for 14 weeks significantly decreased the hepatic lipid profile, oxidative stress, and protein expression in mice. In addition, fermented Tartary buckwheat dietary fiber intervention could regulate high-fat diet-induced disorders of gut microbiota. These results suggested that fermented Tartary buckwheat dietary fiber has potential "prebiotic" effects in ameliorating obesity.

Journal of Functional Foods					Lactobacillus kefiri is a beneficial bacteria that is often used to make yogurt only, and is beneficial to human health when it is used in food fermentation. In this article, a fermentation supernatant (LAF) is prepared by culturing Lactobacillus kefiri, and the anti-aging effects of LAF are evaluated at the biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology levels. The antioxidant activity of LAF is comprehensively evaluated by three free radical scavenging tests and the total antioxidant capacity (ABTS method) test. The toxicity of LAF on human skin fibroblasts (HSF) is detected using the MTT method, and the effects of LAF on H2O2-induced oxidative stress in terms of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), Malondialdehyde (MDA) content, antioxidant enzyme activity are evaluated. The gene expression levels of LC3 and Beclin-1 are detected using the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) method, and the protein expression levels of LC3 are detected using the Western blot method to evaluate the effects of LAF on HSF autophagy. The expression of type I collagen (COL-1), Matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), AKT pathway, MAPK pathway, and other genes are detected by qRT-PCR to study the anti-aging effects of LAF. From the experimental results, it is found that LAF can delay the aging of HSF at the biochemical, cellular, and molecular biology levels, and can be utilized as a functional food ingredient.

J		Yuzong Zhao; Shuangping Liu; Xiao Han; Zhilei Zhou; Jian Mao							Combined effects of fermentation temperature and Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains on free amino acids, flavor substances, and undesirable secondary metabolites in huangjiu fermentation.		Food Microbiology					Fermentation temperature (FT) is one of the most critical factors, which can be used to control the growth conditions of S. cerevisiae to obtain excellent final products in winemaking. In this study, we analyzed the responses of six S. cerevisiae strains with different temperature preferences to FT (20°C, 30°C, and 35°C) in huangjiu fermentation. The flavor substances, free amino acids and undesirable secondary metabolites related to huangjiu quality were determined. Results indicated that both S. cerevisiae strains and FT had significant effects on huangjiu fermentation, while the effects were strain-independent and differentiated temperature preferences for different fermentation characteristics. We found that the effects of FT were greater than that of S. cerevisiae strains under the premise of satisfying fermentation completion. Low temperature (20°C) and high temperature (35°C) fermentation were possible in the production of differentiated industrial huangjiu styles, while the effects of FT on undesirable secondary metabolites needed to be considered before industrial application. The results showed that a combination of FT with one or more S. cerevisiae strains could be used as a fermentation starter in huangjiu production for different types of products.

J		Yuzong Zhao; Shuangping Liu; Qilin Yang; Xiao Han; Zhilei Zhou; Jian Mao							Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains with low-yield higher alcohols and high-yield acetate esters improve the quality, drinking comfort and safety of huangjiu.		Food Research International					Higher alcohols (HAs) and acetate esters (AEs) produced by yeasts are two important volatile flavor substances in fermented alcoholic beverages (FABs). To improve the FABs overall quality, lab-scale huangjiu brewing and systematic evaluation were performed using 171 Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. Finally, two S. cerevisiae strains that produced lower HAs and higher AEs were obtained and named jiangnan1# and jiangnan3#, respectively. The results of production-scale huangjiu fermentation indicated that HAs produced by jiangnan1# sample decreased by 24.99 %, and AEs produced by jiangnan1# increased by 36.35 %. Sensory evaluation showed that the acidic taste, honey aroma attribute intensity were higher in 85# huagnjiu, and the fruity aroma attribute intensity was higher in jiangnan1# huangjiu (P< 0.01). Moreover, urea and ethyl carbamate produced by jiangnan1# strain were degraded by 13.89 % and 45.51 % compared with those of the control strain 85#, indicating the positive effects of jiangnan1# strain on health and safety. Thus, the obtained S. cerevisiae strains in this study can better enhance the flavor and improve the drinking safety and comfort of huangjiu.

J		Zadeh Ghanavati, P. A.; Mojgan Khodadadi; Mehrnoosh Tadayoni							Structural characterization and bioactive and functional properties of the Brown macroalgae (Sargassum illicifolium) polysaccharide.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In the present study, the water-soluble polysaccharide Sargassum illicifolium (WSPSI) was isolated by hot water, and its structural and functional properties were investigated. The extraction yield of the polysaccharide, purity, and its average molecular weight were estimated to be 16.79%, 92.22%, and 316 kDa, respectively. The examination of carbohydrate compounds by High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that this polysaccharide mainly contains arabinose, xylose and galactose. In this study, the presence of alpha-and beta-configurations in WSPSI was demonstrated by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). In this study, the oil holding capacity (OHC) and the water holding capacity (WHC) of WSPSI were estimated at 3.41g oil/g sample and 3.97g water/g sample, respectively. On the other hand, the study of the prebiotic activity of WSPSI showed that it can be effective in the growth and increase of the survival of the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus casei. (ATCC 39,392). The WSPSI also showed inhibitory activity against the pathogen Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 14,028). In addition, WSPSI had a good ability to inhibit 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl (OH) free radicals. The amount of half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of DPPH and OH for WSPSI were 0.43mg/mL and 0.53mg/mL, which were lower than that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Therefore, due to its desirable functional properties, WSPSI can be used as a novel natural component in the formulation of functional foods. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	2	1437	1447	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01283-8					FSTA:2022-12-Rg5211

A comparative study on the structural and functional properties of water-soluble and alkali-soluble dietary fibres from rice bran after hot-water, ultrasound, hydrolysis by cellulase, and combined pre-treatments.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The aim of the study was to estimate the optimum method to obtain water-soluble (WS-DF) and alkali-soluble (AS-DF) dietary fibres fibres from defatted rice bran (DRB) to develop functional components for food. The different pre-treatments of DRB, such as ultrasound (US) treatment, hydrolysis by cellulase (HC) and combined treatment (HC-US), were compared with hot-water (HWT) treatment on yields, and structural, physicochemical, and functional properties of WS-DF and AS-DF. Results. Showed that amounts of WS-DF (5.54-9.03g/100g) and AS-DF (7.22-9.58g/100g), and total dietary fibre (TDF) (42.21-45.44g/100g) obtained from the DRB after US, HC and HC-US treatments were significantly higher than that after HWT (6.36, 5.65 and 31.92g/100g, respectively). The FT-IR indicated that the effect of applied treatments on the changes of the chemical structure of polysaccharides was stronger for the WS-DF than that for the AS-DF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the surfaces of US-treated DFs particles were much more fractured than those after the HWT and HC. The combined HC-US treatment at 50°C for 30min significantly enhanced the purity (85-91%) and homogeneity of RB DFs structure resulting in increased water-holding, swelling and glucose adsorption capacities compared to conventional processes maintaining acceptable bioactivity. Our study showed that conventional hot water extraction could be replaced with the ultrasonication technology as an effective tool for the modification of rice bran DFs' structure and functional properties. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	2	1137	1149	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15480					FSTA:2022-05-Me2552

Variation of aflatoxin levels in stored edible seed and oil samples and risk assessment in the local population.		Toxins					Five hundred and twenty samples of edible seeds and oilseeds (sunflower, palm, peanut, sesame, cotton, and grapeseed) were purchased from markets, farmers, and superstores in the central cities of Punjab, Pakistan. A total of 125 (48.1%) edible seed samples from a 6 ≤ months storage period, and 127 (48.8%) from a 2 ≥ years storage period were found to be infested with AFs. The average elevated amount of AFB1 and total AFs was observed in a 2 ≥ years storage period, i.e., 28.6 4.5 and 51.3 10.4 g/kg, respectively, in sesame seeds. The minimum amount of AFB1 and total AFs was observed in palm seed samples with a storage period of 6 ≤ months, i.e., 9.96 2.4, and 11.7 1.90 g/kg, respectively. The maximum amount of AFB1 and total AFs were observed in peanut oil samples, i.e., 21.43 2.60 and 25.96 4.30 g/kg, respectively, with a storage period of 2 ≥ years. Therefore, the maximum dietary intake of 59.60 ng/kg/day was observed in oil samples stored at a ≥ 2 years storage period. The results of the present study concluded that a significant difference was found in the amounts of total AFs in edible seed samples stored at 6 ≤ months and 2 ≥ years storage periods (p< 0.05). © 2022 by the authors.

Habeebullah; Aateka Vahora							Amino acid composition, microstructure and dielectric properties of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seed protein concentrate and hydrolysate as influenced by degree of hydrolysis.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Garden cress seed (GCS) (Lepidium sativum) waste present potential economic value owing to their health benefits mediated by a presence of unique biopeptides. This study was conducted to investigate the best possible valorization of garden cress seed (GCS) (Lepidium sativum) waste that generated from edible oil extraction. Physical, structural, morphological, and dielectric properties of protein concentrate and hydrolysate obtained from oil extracted garden cress pomace. The obtained protein and hydrolysate at two different hydrolysis degrees (10% and 15%) were characterized for color properties, amino acid composition, atomic force microscope (AFM) topography, Scanning electron microscope (SEM) microscopy and dielectric profile. Protein hydrolysates showed a significant increase in some of the amino acids (Asp, Glu, Gly, Arg, Cys, and Phe) with an increase in the degree of hydrolysis (%DH). The color values showed a minor increase due to hydrolysis of GCS protein. The SEM and AFM observations of the morphological structure of garden cress seed protein concentrate (GCSPC) and garden cress seed protein hydrolysates (GCSPHs) confirmed flat disk like shape of GCS protein and pore formation due to Alcalase hydrolysis. It was interesting to find that Alcalase hydrolysis reduced the Root Mean Square height and Arithmetic mean height of GCS protein particles. The dielectric constant (epsilon′) decreased with Alcalase hydrolysis. Enhanced crystallinity of GCS protein was observed due to hydrolysis. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	6	5058	5065	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01588-8					FSTA:2023-03-Jq3584
J		Zagata, L.; Urban, J.; Uhnak, T.							Revalidation and empirical application of the Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale (CAFPAS).		Food Quality and Preference					The aim of this study is to verify the validity and empirical applicability of the CAFPAS (Cooking and Food Provisioning Action Scale), which was created in the USA in 2017 (Lahne et al., 2017; Lahne et al., 2019). The international application of standardized scales requires the creation of more than one language version of the measuring instrument. The scale was translated into Czech in several systematic steps, piloted and then incorporated into a large quantitative survey, which was carried out between January and April 2021. Data in the survey were collected by a professional research agency, using the IBM Data Collection system. The target population of the study were adults in the Czech Republic. The research sample included 1122 respondents with three quota variables-gender, education and age, which reflected the structure of the target population. The analysis demonstrated that food agency is significantly influenced by gender, age, income and marital status. In the context of the Czech Republic, the place of residence (or type of housing) was also identified as an important predictor. The Czech version of the scale confirms its wider applicability outside the US cultural environment.

Journal of Cereal Science					High amylopectin-based waxy maize is popular as food-, feed-and industrial products. Traditional maize is low in amylopectin (~70-75%), while waxy maize due to the recessive waxy1 (wx1) gene possesses ~95-100% amylopectin. Here, the recessive wx1 gene was introgressed (from MGU-102-wx1) into three elite inbreds that are the parents of two popular sub-tropically adapted maize hybrids viz., HM4 (HKI1105 * HKI323) and HM9 (HKI1105 * HKI1128). BC1F1, BC2F1 and BC2F2 populations were successfully genotyped using gene-based SSR, phi022. The Wx1 gene segregated as per Mendelian inheritance. Background selection using 104-107 SSRs helped in recovering >94% of the recurrent parent genome. MAS-derived inbreds possessed an average of 96.7% amylopectin (range: 95.1-98.7%) compared to 70.5% (range: 69.2-71.6%) among original inbreds. The reconstituted waxy hybrids also recorded significantly higher amylopectin (mean: 98.0%, range: 96.9-98.9%) compared to original hybrids (mean: 69.7%, range: 69.1-70.2%). Waxy hybrids both in yellow and white genetic backgrounds possessed similar grain yield (mean: 5871kg/ha, range: 5511-6295kg/ha) with their original versions (mean: 5914kg/ha, range: 5817-6010kg/ha) across three locations. These waxy hybrids rich in amylopectin hold significant promise for food security and industrial use. This is the first report of conversion of normal maize hybrids to high amylopectin using genomics-assisted breeding.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study was conducted to investigate the effects of steeping and sprouting on bioactive compounds of five pigmented rice, including two black and three red rice cultivars, and one ordinary rice. Dehulled rice samples were soaked in distilled water at 25 °C for different durations (0, 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48h) and allowed to germinate under the dark condition at 25 °C and 95% humidity for 3days. As the steeping time progressed up to 24h, the germination rate and sprout growth of pigmented rice increased, and decreased at 48h. During the soaking process, a gradual decrease in L* value (lightness) of soaking water was observed, with the highest reduction observed in Bosukheugchal (waxy black rice cultivar), indicating a considerable loss of anthocyanin during soaking. Black rice cultivars had the highest level of anthocyanin content, which was significantly reduced after germination. gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) content (6.68-74.58gg-1) of pigmented rice cultivars increased significantly (226.36-339.91gg-1) (P≤0.05) after germination. Germinated rice had 3.55 to 33.88-times higher GABA content than non-germinated rice. Total phenolic and flavonoid content in pigmented rice cultivars also increased after germination. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	1	201	209	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15105					FSTA:2022-04-Me1876

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Wheatgrass and barley grass are freshly sprouted leaves of wheat and barley seeds and are rich sources of phytochemicals. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of drought stress on the biochemical compounds and antioxidant activities of barley grass and wheatgrass extracts. The grass was cultivated in an organic soil growing medium with different levels of drought stress (a control with 100% water holding capacity (WHC), mild drought stress with 75% WHC, moderate drought stress with 50% WHC, and severe drought stress with 25% WHC) in a growth chamber by controlling temperature (20/15°C, day/night), light (12/12h, light/dark; intensity 150mumolm-2 s-1 with quantum dot light-emitting diodes), and relative humidity (60%) for 7days. The drought stress showed increased levels of biochemical compounds, especially phenolics, flavonoids, and vitamin C, in both barley grass and wheatgrass extracts. The wheatgrass extracts showed 1.38-1.67 times higher phenolics, flavonoids, and vitamin C contents than the barley grass extracts did. The antioxidant (2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging activity, and nitrite-scavenging activity) and antioxidant enzymes (guaiacol peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione reductase) were the highest under severe drought stress in both barley grass and wheatgrass extracts; and the wheatgrass extracts showed 1.20-5.70 times higher antioxidant enzyme activities than the barley grass extracts did. Proper drought-stress treatment of barley grass and wheatgrass may be a convenient and efficient method to increase biochemical compounds and antioxidants in our diet to exploit the related health benefits. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	5	1995	2002	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11538					FSTA:2022-06-Ma3549

Salmonella spp: prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and molecular typing of strains isolated from poultry in Tetouan-Morocco.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Salmonellosis is one of the most common food-borne illnesses in the world. The irrational use of antibiotics in medicine and in animal nutrition has greatly favored the emergence and spread of resistant strains of non-typhoid Salmonella. 620 samples from poultry samples were biochemically analyzed for the presence of Salmonella according to ISO 6579 and molecularly confirmed. The selected positive strains were tested for antibiotic susceptibility, characterized to the levels of species, subspecies and serovars using PCR. Furthermore, they were typed using MLST and MLVA, and phylogenetically grouped by MLSA. Prevalence of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica was 9.84%, grouped in seven serovars, with a major presence of serovar S. Hadar (23.80%), S. Typhimurium and S. Chester (19.05% for each serovar), followed by S. Schwarzengrund (14.28%), S. Kentucky, S. Bredeney (9.52%) and S. Saintpaul (4.76%). Drug susceptibility testing showed that 80.95% of Salmonella isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic and 19.05% were susceptible to all antibiotics tested. Nine different MLST STs (sequence types) were detected, ST1954 being the most common, which was mostly found in S. Chester isolates from poultry. There was a marked change in the serovars and antimicrobial resistance profiles of Salmonella isolates in this study compared to those in previous studies. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Zr-based metal-organic framework incorporated polystyrene nanocomposite as a novel sorbent for ultrasound assisted-thin film microextraction of organophosphorus pesticides from complex samples.		Food Chemistry					In this work, a novel ultrasound assisted-thin film microextraction (USA-TFME) method has been developed to determine organophosphorus pesticides (OPPs) in some fruits and vegetables samples followed by gas chromatography. In this regards, a novel nanocomposite (NC) was prepared by incorporation of zirconium-based metal-organic framework (MOF) into polystyrene (UiO-66/PS) and used as an efficient thin film. The effect of MOF doping level into UiO-66/PS NC and also the effective parameters influencing the TFME method has been studied. Based on the method validation, limits of detection were in the range of 1.5 to 3 g kg-1. The intra-day precision, inter-day precision and inter-sorbent precision were in the range of 5.1 to 7.2, 5.3 to 10.2 and 4.6 to 7.3 %, respectively.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effect of co-encapsulation of broccoli sprout extract (BSE) nanoliposomes with basil seed gum (BSG) on the physicochemical and morphological properties and release of sulforaphane (SF) from them. To obtain nanocapsules, first, nanoliposomes were prepared using lecithin and different levels of BSE (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% w/w), and then they were coated with different concentrations of BSG (0.5, 1.0, and 1.5% w/w). Nanocapsules were prepared by the thin-film rehydration method. The nanocapsules containing 1% BSE coated with 0.5% BSG (L1BSG0.5) had the lowest particle size (39.60 nm), polydispersity index (PDI) (0.279), and the high-efficiency yields (EY) (97.96%); therefore, it was selected as the best sample and its other characteristics were evaluated. These nanocapsules had high zeta potential (-71.16mV), so they showed good stability, and also had a spherical shape with low particle aggregation and had a proper particle size distribution. The FTIR spectroscopy results showed a physical interaction between the components of the nanocapsules, and also no new chemical bonding was observed. Encapsulation of BSE also reduced the rate of SF release from the capsules compared to the free SF. Release of SF occurred faster in the simulated intestinal conditions (pH = 7.4) than in the simulated gastric conditions (pH = 1.2). Accordingly, the nanocapsules can be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries as a good SF delivery system.

Food Science & Nutrition					This study aimed to produce the functional ricotta cheese using broccoli sprouts extract (BSE) and to evaluate its physicochemical, antioxidant, rheological, and sensory properties. The BSE nano-liposome was nano-encapsulated into basil seed gum (BSG) and was incorporated into the ricotta cheese formulation in two forms of free and nano-capsules in two levels of 3% and 5% w/w. The measurements were conducted during a 15-day storage period at 4-6°C. The results showed that the titratable acidity, hardness, and chewiness of cheeses were increased and the pH, moisture, total phenol content (TPC), and antioxidant activity were decreased (p<.05). With the addition of BSE concentration, the TPC and antioxidant activity increased significantly (p<.05) and applying the nano-encapsulation method for BSE led to better preservation of bioactive compounds. Based on the rheological results, viscoelastic solid behavior and a weak gel were observed in all cheese samples. The results of sensory evaluation demonstrated that cheeses containing free extract had lower flavor and overall acceptability scores than other samples, which indicates that the nano-encapsulation covered the undesirable flavor of the BSE. Generally, during the 15-day cold storage period, the highest sensory acceptance and functional activity were related to the samples containing nano-encapsulated BSE, especially at the 5% level. © 2022 Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University.

Their functional (antioxidant and antibacterial) properties were tested in vitro, and their anti-Listeria effect (at 0.4 and 0.8% w/w) on ricotta cheese was evaluated. The produced nanoliposomes and nano-capsules were spherical in shape and did not tend to accumulate. The mean particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and encapsulation efficiency (EE) were observed about 39.60 and 69.00 nm, 0.279 and 0.496, 85.73 and 88.46% for nano-capsules and nanoliposomes, respectively. The zeta potential (zeta) values were observed at -65.73 and -71.16mV and therefore the nanoparticles had good stability and uniform particle size distribution. Encapsulation had no significant effect on total phenol and flavonoids content of the BSE. The amounts of these active compounds were in the range of 25.12-26.97mg GAE/g dw and 6.84-6.95mg QE/g dw, respectively. The free and encapsulated BSE displaying good AOA in the DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. Results of the ABA measured by inhibition zone diameter and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) demonstrated that the free BSE had antibacterial action against the tested Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and the nano-encapsulation process led to improved ABA of this extract. The organic acids in BES indicated the presence of high levels of citric, malic and oxalic acids at 613,98 and, 45 (mg/g dw), respectively. The BSE-loaded nanoparticles showed remarkable anti-Listeria activity in ricotta cheese, which their activity increased with increasing their concentration. In conclusion, BSE-loaded nanoliposomes and nano-capsules have potential interest to be used as natural antioxidants and preservatives for food applications.

J		Zahra Eslami; Vahideh Mahdavi; Akbarzadeh Mofrad, A.							Simultaneous multi-determination of pesticide residues in barberry: a risk assessment study.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This research aims to analyze 57 pesticide residues in 35 ready-to-use barberry samples collected from hypermarkets in Iran by Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe (QuEChERS) approach using acetonitrile for the extraction, and surface adsorbents for clean-up procedure, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). In addition, non-carcinogenic probabilistic health risk assessment was estimated by Hazard Quotient (HQ) and Hazard Index (HI) based on the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. Results demonstrated that 48.5% of samples contained pesticide residues including carbendazim, dimethoate, imidacloprid, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, fenitrothion, and fenpropathrin. Approximately 14% of the samples contained residue levels higher than MRL values including carbendazim, dimethoate, and chlorpyrifos. The highest pesticide concentration exceeding MRLs belonged to dimethoate with average residual value of 1.04mg kg-1. The rank order of percentile 95% as health risk benchmark of HQ calculated for pesticides in adults' consumers of barberry was dimethoate > chlorpyrifos > carbendazim with values of 5.63E-3, 2.14E-3, and 4.07E-6, respectively, while percentile 95% values of HQ in the children's consumers were 2.64E-2,9.97E-3, and 1.88E-5 with the same rank order. HI values in adults and children due to ingestion of barberry were 7.77E-3 and 4.63E-2, respectively. The results of this assessment demonstrated that the consumers were not at considerable non-carcinogenic risk in this commodity.

J		Zahra Esparvarini; Behnaz Bazargani-Gilani; Mohammadreza Pajohi-Alamoti; Alireza Nourian							Gelatin-starch composite coating containing cucumber peel extract and cumin essential oil: shelf life improvement of a cheese model.		Food Science & Nutrition					In this study, the effects of gelatin-starch (GS) composite coating containing cucumber peel extract (CPE) and cumin essential oil (CEO) were evaluated on the shelf life enhancement of ultrafiltered (UF) cheese during 56 days of storage under refrigerated conditions. The obtained hydroethanolic CPE by the microwave method showed the best results in terms of the total phenolic content, reducing power, 2,2′-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) activity, and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging activity compared to the immersion and ultrasound methods. The studied treatments were as follows: Control (C), GS, CPE, CEO, GS-CPE, GS-CEO, and GS-CPE-CEO. Scanning electron microscopic surface morphology of treated cheese samples showed the formation of a firm, integrated, flawless, and homogenous layer on the cheese slices of the GS-CPE-CEO treatment. All treatments significantly (p ≤ .05) decreased the total viable count, psychotropic bacteria, and yeast-mold population compared to the control group. Adding CEO and/or CPE to GS significantly (p ≤ .05) controlled undesirable changes in physical characteristics, such as weight, color, and hardness of the cheese slices. Throughout storage time, the coated cheese slices showed more stable chemical features in comparison to the uncoated cheese samples in terms of moisture, lipid oxidation, pH, and titratable acidity (TA). Sensory evaluation of the preparations showed that the GS coating containing CPE and CEO significantly (p ≤ .05) had pleasant effects on the sensory features (taste, odor, texture, and overall acceptability) of the cheese samples during storage time. It was concluded that composite coating of GS containing CPE and CEO could improve the microbial, physical, chemical, and sensory features of ultrafiltration (UF) cheese during refrigerated storage. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zahra Ghobadi; Zohreh Hamidi-Esfahani; Hossein Azizi, M.							Statistical optimization of arachidonic acid synthesis by Mortierella alpina CBS 754.68 in a solid-state fermenter.		Food Science & Nutrition					Arachidonic acid (ARA) is an omega-6 fatty acid that plays a major role in human health. The present study optimizes the production of ARA by the soil fungus Mortierella alpina CBS 754.68 on oil cakes. In the first step, the best substrate was chosen from four oil cakes, namely soybean, sunflower, olive, and colza oil cakes, of which sunflower oil cake showed the highest yield. In the next step, screening tests were performed using the Plackett-Burman design. Seven variables (substrate particle size, moisture content, time, temperature, yeast extract, glucose, and glutamate) were investigated (each taking values of + 1 and -1). Among these variables, time, temperature, and substrate particle size significantly affected ARA production (p<.05), so they were further investigated in the optimization step. The optimal fermentation time, temperature, and substrate particle size calculated by response surface methodology were 8.75 days, 18.5°C, and 1.3mm-1.7mm, respectively. Under these conditions, M. alpina was predicted to produce 4.19mg of ARA/g dry weight of substrate (DWS). The actual yield, determined in evaluation tests, was 4.48 0.16mg ARA/g DWS, which shows the accuracy of the model. In the final step, the effect of the aeration rate on producing ARA was investigated in a packed-bed solid-state fermenter under the determined optimal conditions. In this stage, the highest ARA yield was 10.13 0.26mg/g DWS, approximately double that of the optimization step, and this confirms that aeration increases ARA production by M. alpina. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zahra Khoshbin; Khalil Abnous; Mohammad Taghdisi, S.; Asma Verdian; Elham Sameiyan; Mohammad Ramezani; Mona Alibolandi							An ultra-sensitive dual-responsive aptasensor with combination of liquid crystal and intercalating dye molecules: a food toxin case study.		Food Chemistry					Herein, a label-free aptasensor was designed through forming a double-stranded DNA skeleton on the glass substrate for ultrasensitive quantification of ochratoxin A (OTA) as a case study. The function fundament of the dual-responsive aptasensor was the perturbation of the vertical alignment of the liquid crystals (LCs) and intercalation of the SYBR Green I (SGI) dye molecules between the base pairs of the double-stranded DNA structure. The presence of OTA decomposed the double-stranded structure of DNA by releasing the OTA-specific aptamer from the sensing platform that induced an apparent alteration of the optical and fluorescent responses. The aptasensor specifically detected the ultra-low levels of OTA as 47.0E-9 pM (0.047 aM) and 34.0E-3 pM (34 fM) based on the polarized and fluorescent responses, respectively. The aptasensor monitored OTA in the coffee and grape drink samples. The aptasensor provides promising insight for manufacturing real-time, cost-effective, and portable sensing devices for food control usage.

Utilization in situ of biodegradable films produced with chitosan, and functionalized with epsilon-poly-L-lysine: an effective approach for super antibacterial application.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, the chitosan (1% w/v) was hydrated in an aqueous solution of glacial acetic acid (1% w/v) by using a magnetic stirrer and mixed with glycerol (0.75% v/v), as a plasticizer. The four types of chitosan films were fabricated by adding 1.5% cinnamaldehyde and 0.05% epsilon-poly-L-lysine, and the mechanical, physical and antibacterial properties of the treatments were determined. Mechanical results indicated that the addition of cinnamaldehyde significantly increased the tensile strength and decreased the elongation at break. Moreover, the addition of cinnamaldehyde increased the thickness and decreased water solubility, moisture and water vapor permeability. FT-IR showed the formation of Schiff base and hydrogen bonds between the functional groups of the components, which improved the mechanical and physical properties of the treatments. Changes in the surface of the films were evaluated by SEM images. Further, the antimicrobial activity of the films containing cinnamaldehyde and epsilon-poly-L-lysine was confirmed against gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium and gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. Based on the results, the films containing cinnamaldehyde and epsilon-poly-L-lysine can be used as the functional packaging for food products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	2	1416	1425	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01297-2					FSTA:2022-12-Fe2525
J		Zahra Panahi; Mohammad Mohsenzadeh							Sodium alginate edible coating containing Ferulago angulata (Schlecht.) Boiss essential oil, nisin, and NaCl: its impact on microbial, chemical, and sensorial properties of refrigerated chicken breast.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					This study aimed to investigate the effects of sodium alginate (ALG) coating incorporated with Ferulago angulata (Schlecht.) Boiss essential oil (FAEO, 10 and 20mg/mL), nisin (N, 500 and 1000 IU/mL), and NaCl (2 %) on microbial (lactic acid bacteria, LAB; total viable bacteria, TVC; psychrotrophic bacteria; Pseudomonas; Enterobacteriaceae, and yeast and mold), chemical (pH, PV, TVB-N, and TBARS), sensory (color, odor, texture, and overall acceptance), and antioxidant properties of refrigerated (4°C) chicken breasts. GC-MS analysis revealed that trans-beta-ocimene (45.36 %) and alpha-pinene (18.01 %) constituted most of the components in FAEO. The antioxidant properties of FAEO were evaluated via the DPPH method. The IC50 value of FAEO was 562mg/mL. The results of antimicrobial evaluations indicated that there was no significant difference between control and ALG treatments (p > 0.05). The highest antimicrobial effect was associated with ALG + FAEO2 + N2 + NaCl treatment. The logarithmic reduction of the TVC, psychrotrophic count, Pseudomonascount, Enterobacteriaceae, LAB, as well as yeast and mold count in the ALG + FAEO2 + N2 + NaCl treatment were 1.40, 0.92, 1.20, 1.02, 0.88, and 1 log CFU/g, respectively compared to the control treatment. The initial level of TVB-N in the control treatment was 8.26mg/100g, which reached 42.84mg/100g at the end of the storage period. In ALG + FAEO2 + N2 + NaCl treatment, the lowest TVB-N was observed, being 36.37mg/100g at the end of the storage period. The initial level of PV in the control treatment was 0.14meq/kg, which reached 3.04meq/kg at the end of the storage period. In the treatments containing FAEO, PV was lower than in other treatments, indicating the antioxidant properties of FAEO. There was a significant difference between control and other treatments in pH and TBARS evaluation (p < 0.05). The samples treated with FAEO had a lower pH than control. At the end of the storage period, the TBARS level in the control treatment reached 1.20mg MDA/kg, while in the treatment of ALG + FAEO2 + N2 + NaCl treatment, its level was 0.36mg MDA/kg. The results of sensory properties indicated that in evaluating the color, odor, texture, and overall acceptance on the final days, treatments containing FAEO, nisin, and NaCl had higher scores due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. In conclusion, this study indicated that adding FAEO, nisin, and NaCl to ALG coating would enhance the shelf-life of chicken meat.

J		Zahra Sarlak; Saeedeh Shojaee-Aliabadi; Nayebali Rezvani; Hedayat Hosseini; Milad Rouhi; Zahra Dastafkan							Development and validation of TaqMan real-time PCR assays for quantification of chicken adulteration in hamburgers.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Four quantification methods based on absolute (model), relative (model II) and normalized approaches (models III and IV) were developed to estimate the percentage of chicken substitution in beef burgers using TaqMan real-time PCR. The cytochrome b (cytb) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) regions were used for the chicken identification and normalization of assay results, respectively. The plotted curves of four models using the reference chicken-beef mixtures represented the linear correlation (0.9962-0.9995), and the acceptable amplification efficiencies (98.60%-110.12%) within the range of recommended values. The results of validation plan using the model samples (mixtures and burgers prepared with chicken meat or chicken paste in beef meat) showed the better trueness parameters for model mixtures in models III and IV (-0.12% to-18.03%) in comparison with models and II (-5.11% to -43.95%). Also, an over-estimation of chicken adulteration in model burgers was quantified by models and II (with trueness 99.18%-170.19%), while the normalized models gave a more accurate estimation of chicken percentage (with trueness-0.26% to-1.29%). The developed TaqMan-qPCR assay could reliably quantify 0.01% of chicken meat in chicken-beef mixtures without any cross-reactivity. Finally, the normalized approaches as validated models recognized the mislabeling in some commercial hamburger brands.

Anti-otomycotic potential of nanoparticles of Moringa oleifera leaf extract: an integrated in vitro, in silico and phase 0 clinical study.		Food & Function					Otomycosis is a serious superficial mycotic infection of the outer ear canal caused by some pathogenic species of Candida and Aspergillus. The infection remains a challenge to clinicians owing to the incomplete efficacy of market-available antifungal agents and high recurrence rates. The Moringa oleifera leaf ethanol extract showed efficacy against Candida albicans SC5314, compared to Nystatin as a reference with MIC values of 7 and 718.33mug ml-1, respectively. The extract was mixed with lecithin and chitosan to give Moringa core/shell giant nanoparticles, with a good zeta potential (+ 59.2mV), a suitable entrapment efficiency (61%) and an enhanced release reaching up to 90% at 8 h. Clinical isolates from oomycote patients were identified via DNA sequencing as Candida parapsilosis, Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus flavus, and the effect of the prepared nanoparticles was tested against them via disk diffusion assay to give inhibition zones of 75,55 and 55mm, compared to Nystatin with 35,25 and 20mm, respectively. Interestingly, patients treated with the Moringa-loaded nanoparticles experienced improvement within 1 week with no recurrence for more than 3months. To have some insight into the bioactive components in the Moringa extract, LC-HRMS-based identification has been employed which led to the annotation of 27 compounds. Subsequent comprehensive in silico investigation suggested some alkaloids to be responsible for the activity targeting the fungal 14-alpha-demethylase enzyme (CYP51B). Our study revealed that Moringa extract-loaded nanoparticles attained an enhanced antifungal efficacy compared to Nystatin and therefore they can be employed against invasive and drug-resistant otomycotic infections. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Zaidan, N.; Nazzal, L.							The microbiome and uremic solutes.		Toxins					Uremic retention solutes, especially the protein-bound compounds, are toxic metabolites, difficult to eliminate with progressive renal functional decline. They are of particular interest because these uremic solutes are responsible for the pathogenesis of cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. Evidence suggests that the relation between uremic toxins, the microbiome, and its host is altered in patients with chronic kidney disease, with the colon's motility, epithelial integrity, and absorptive properties also playing an important role. Studies found an alteration of the microbiota composition with differences in species proportion, diversity, and function. Since uremic toxins precursors are generated by the microbiota, multiple therapeutic options are currently being explored to address dysbiosis. While an oral adsorbent can decrease the transport of bacterial metabolites from the intestinal lumen to the blood, dietary measures, supplements (prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics), and antibiotics aim to target directly the gut microbiota composition. Innovative approaches, such as the modulation of bacterial enzymes, open new perspectives to decrease the plasma level of uremic toxins. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Effects of the seasonal variation in the phytochemical composition and bioactivities of the wild halophyte Suaeda fruticosa.		Food Bioscience					Suaeda fruticosa is an edible medicinal species belonging to the Amaranthaceae (Chenopodiaceae) family widely distributed in the Mediterranean regions, especially in Tunisia. This species shoots change their colour from green to red-violet along the different seasons, being an interesting matrix to study for its chemical composition. Therefore, in a ground-breaking study, the hydromethanolic extracts of green and red-violet Tunisian S. fruticosa shoots were profiled for their individual phenolic compounds and betalains by High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with a Diode-Array Detector and Mass Spectrometry by Electrospray Ionization (HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS), and the in vitro antioxidant, antibacterial, and hepatotoxic properties were also assessed. The obtained results revealed that the hydromethanolic extracts contain interesting levels of phenolic compounds especially O-glycosylated and acylated flavonoids, while betacyanins were the main betalain compounds found. As expected, red-violet shoots were richer in phenolic compounds (45.5 0.2mg/g extract) and betalains (33.3 0.2mg/g extract) than greener shoots. Flavonoid/betalains rich extracts presented lower EC50 values for ABTS+, DPPH, and TBARS; as also lower MIC values against Gram-positive bacteria. This study showed that the wild halophyte growing in a hard environment, were drought and salinity are dominant, is an important source of flavonoids and betanin, important molecules that can find application in different industries, given the constant demands for natural bioactives and colouring compounds. Overall, these natural compounds may be valorised and further investigated to validate their potential as functional ingredients.

J		Zaizhi Liu; Hualan Li; Zheng Zhu; Dai Huang; Yanlong Qi; Chunhui Ma; Zhengrong Zou; Hiyan Ni							Cinnamomum camphora fruit peel as a source of essential oil extracted using the solvent-free microwave-assisted method compared with conventional hydrodistillation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present study, essential oil from Cinnamomum camphora fruit peel was first separated and characterized by GC-MS. Solvent-free microwave-assisted extraction (SFME) was performed to isolate the essential oil, and the extraction procedure was optimized using a Box-Behnken design. The optimum SFME conditions yielded 80.35 1.88 mg/g of essential oil with 76% moisture content, using a microwave irradiation power of 420 W and an irradiation time of 22 min. No obvious difference was observed between physical constants of essential oil extracted by SFME and hydrodistillation (HD). Scanning electron microscopy micrographs demonstrated more disruption of C. camphora fruit peel cells treated with SFME than by conventional HD. SFME was proposed as an energy-saving, high-efficiency, and environmentally friendly method, as evidenced by its higher yield and volumetric mass transfer coefficient, larger proportions of oxygen compounds, lower consumption of electricity, and lower amounts of CO2 release and water waste compared to conventional HD. The results show that a once-discarded part of C. camphora can be utilized as a source for the production of essential oil.

J		Zajac, M.; Zajac, K.; Dybas, J.							The effect of nitric oxide synthase and arginine on the color of cooked meat.		Food Chemistry					In previous studies, it has been suggested that the NO-synthase enzyme may be responsible for color formation in fermented sausages. Thus, this is the first study in which the aim was to analyze the effects of direct NO-synthase and arginine application to meat on its color after heating. Myoglobin forms as well as the presence of NO-myoglobin were investigated. The color of the meat and myoglobin forms present in the samples were mainly affected by pH differences, caused by a HEPES buffer or arginine. None of the variants demonstrated a bright pink color as in the case of the heated nitrite-cured sample. Based on analysis of the absorption spectra, it can be concluded that there is some evidence of nitroso-complex formation. Therefore, it is probable that optimizing the pH/time/temperature conditions for NO-synthase activity would allow to obtain a desirable color effect. NO-synthase could be used as an alternative curing ingredient. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

In vitro gastrointestinal bioaccessibility and colonic fermentation of lignans from fresh, fermented, and germinated flaxseed.		Food & Function					This research assessed the influence of fermentation and germination as well as of particle size on lignan bioaccessibility from flaxseed by simulated in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. In vitro simulated colonic fermentation was used to study lignan release and its conversion into enterolignans. In addition, tea was included as a representative sample to investigate the stability of lignans in the gastrointestinal tract. Only secoisolariciresinol (SECO) was detected in flaxseed samples. SECO bioaccessibility in fermented flaxseed was highest among all matrices but limited to 1% (P< 0.001). Lignan bioaccessibility was significantly influenced by particle size too (P< 0.001 for both). In the colon, fermented flaxseed produced the highest SECO release among all flaxseed samples ( 65%), and the highest conversion of enterolignan ( 1.0%), whereas the conversion of lignans in tea brew was relatively high ( 15%). Lignan conversion varies greatly among donors due to inter-individual differences in microbiota activity. Food fermentation could be a viable strategy for increasing lignan release and conversion to enterolignan. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.

J		Zakir Husain; Saswata Ghosh; Mousumi Dutta							Changes in dietary practices of mother and child during the COVID-19 lockdown: results from a household survey in Bihar, India.		Food Policy					The outbreak of COVID-19, and the national-level lockdown to contain it, were expected to disrupt supply chains, lead to livelihood loss, and reduce household income. Studies anticipated a decline in food security in India, leading to a near famine-like situation. In this study, we examine the change in Dietary Score (number of food groups consumed out of a possible eight) and proportion of respondents complying with Minimum Dietary Diversity norms (consuming at least four food groups) among women aged 15-49 years and their youngest child (aged between 7 and 36 months) during the lockdown. The present study also analyses whether ownership of ration cards and contacts with the party in power locally helped the household to tide over the crisis. The data was collected through a two-phase primary survey undertaken in January-March 2020 (pre-lockdown period) and October-November 2020 (post-lockdown period). It was undertaken in six districts of Bihar, a state with a history of poor maternal and child health outcomes and dysfunctional delivery of health services. We find that dietary practices of women deteriorated, while that of children remained the same. The deterioration is less among households owning ration cards or having political contacts. The analysis suggests that, during pandemics or similar crisis periods, the need to supplement the supply of staple items through the Public Distribution System with a direct transfer of cash will allow households to maintain diversity in the consumption basket.

J		Zakrzewski, A. J.; Chajecka-Wierzchowska, W.; Zadernowska, A.							Ceviche-natural preservative: possibility of microbiota survival and effect on L. monocytogenes.		Foods					Ceviche is a marinated raw fish dish ready for consumption; it is a part of the cuisine of various countries on the Pacific coast and its preparation may differ among them. Although the process uses the traditional method of food preservation by lowering the pH, the exposure time is very limited, so the aim of the study was to determine the viability of bacteria often isolated from fish after the process of preparing traditional ceviche. For this purpose, the traditional plate method and flow cytometry were used, and for pathogenic L. monocytogenes strains, the influence of stress during the preparation of the dish on the pathogenic potential was determined. The study showed that the highest percentage of viable cells was observed in the case of L. monocytogenes and remained at the level of 98.54%, slightly less for L. innocua, 96.93%. For the remaining species the reduction did not exceed 10%, for E. faecalis it was 92.76%, for S. liquefaciens 91.44%, H. alvei 93.68%. In addition, the study of the antibacterial properties of individual ingredients showed that habanero and coriander did not show any bactericidal effect, while for onions the amount of live cells was 99.11%, and for lime juice 97.26%, Additionally, the study of changes in virulence, antibiotic resistance and gene expression showed that the stress during the preparation of ceviche has different effects depending on the strain and may cause virulence potential increase, levofloxacin and daptomycin minimum inhibiotory concentration increase and some crucial virulence gene expression induction; therefore, it is important to take care of the quality of the products used to prepare the ceviche and accurate pretreatment. © 2022 by the authors.

Effect of humectants and Zygosaccharomyces bailii inoculation on the physical stability of oil-in-water emulsions modeling salad dressings.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Salad dressing formulations include a pH within 3.2-4.1, salt and other solutes to depress water activity. The interaction between hydrocolloids and other components such as humectants determines their physical and microbiological stability. To our knowledge, the effect of commonly used solutes on physical stability and rheological characteristics of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by xanthan gum has not been reported, and neither has the effect of a spoilage yeast on physical stability been evaluated. Results. The effect of different humectants (sodium chloride, glucose and xylitol) and Zygosaccharomyces bailii inoculation on the stability of oil-in-water emulsions containing different levels of xanthan gum to emulate different types of salad dressings was investigated by means of droplet size, zeta potential, rheological measurements and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Generally, the addition of humectants strengthened the weak or strong emulsion structure, especially xylitol. Glucose or xylitol acted as stabilizers since they decreased Sauter and De Broucker diameter. On the contrary, NaCl destabilized the emulsions since it increased droplet size and exhibited the lowest absolute values of zeta potential. Inoculation with Z. bailii destabilized some emulsions since it increased Sauter and De Broucker diameter. Emulsion droplet size, polydispersity, and xanthan gum and yeast location were confirmed by CLSM imaging. Conclusion. This study highlights the key role of humectants and xanthan gum level on physical characteristics and stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Addition of xylitol leads to an enhancement in emulsion rheology and physical stability, suggesting that it is a potential low-calorie multifunctional additive for salad dressings. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Zalewska, M.; Marcinkowska-Lesiak, M.; Onopiuk, A.							Application of different drying methods and their influence on the physicochemical properties of tomatoes.		European Food Research and Technology					This paper presents the results of research on the influence of selected drying methods and parameters on the physicochemical properties of tomatoes. The samples were subjected to the process of convection and vacuum drying at the temperature of 60 and 80°C for 2 and 4 h, and then their physical properties (colour, weight loss, water activity, dry matter content) and chemical properties (extract content, total acidity, total antioxidant activity, vitamin C, lycopene, total phenols, flavonoids and their losses during drying) were compared with a control sample. Both drying method, temperature and time had a significant effect on colour of the tomatoes after drying. Lightness for convective drying for 4 h was significantly lower at 80°C compared with 60°C (32.21 and 36.58 respectively). The smallest content of ascorbic acid was recorded for samples dried under convection conditions for 4 h at 80°C (5.68mg). In addition, the amount of lycopene dropped drastically for samples dried under vacuum and convection for 4 h at 80°C (1.51 and 1.10mg respectively). On the basis of the obtained results, it was found that a properly conducted drying process and well-chosen temperature and time parameters contribute to the reduction of antioxidant losses as well as colour changes of the final product. It is recommended to dry tomato samples at a temperature no higher than 60°C in vacuum to avoid browning reactions which influence on the colour of the tomatoes, as well as high losses of antioxidants. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Food Control					Wine traceability based on DNA analysis has been reported in several previous studies but no one until now had monitored how far molecular traceability was possible during wine storage, before and after bottling. The present study tries to fill this gap of knowledge by following, in the real case of a large wine cooperative, the possibility to trace wine production through DNA analysis during storage period. Two monovarietal productions: red sparkling Bonarda PDO and white Pinot gris PDO, were followed starting from the end of oenological practices until 1 year after bottling. During the pre-bottling period, samples were collected every 10 days during four consecutive months, after bottling samples were collected at day 1 and after 2, 8 and 12 months. DNA analysis evidences that for both wines, traceability by applying SSR analysis on the extracted DNA is possible, at least, until month 8, after that DNA degradation increases hindering, mainly for the red wine, the possibility to a correct varietal identification.

Promoting the preservation of strawberry by supercritical CO2 drying.		Food Chemistry					This work aimed to investigate the supercritical CO2 (ScCO2) drying of strawberries and its effect on enzymatic, chemical and microbial stability. Process conditions influenced the final weight loss (WL), water activity (aw) and the inactivation of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD). At 40°C, an efficient drying (WL > 92 %, aw< 0.34) and a complete enzymatic (POD and PPO activity) inactivation can be achieved using several combinations of pressure, time and flow rate. ScCO2 dried strawberry at 40°C, 13.3 MPa, 7 h and 19kg/h flow rate maintain the total content of Vitamin C (358.5mg/100g), 95 % of total anthocyanin (61.68mg/100g) and 76 % of total flavonoids (25.85mg/100g) in comparison with fresh samples. Foodborne pathogens (E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica and Listeria monocytogenes) inoculated at high concentration ( ≥ 6 log CFU/g) were undetected after the process. Overall results are promising for the development of a novel low temperature drying process for the production of healthy and safe snack.

J		Zambrano, Y.; Contardo, I.; Moreno, M. C.; Bouchon, P.							Effect of extrusion temperature and feed moisture content on the microstructural properties of rice-flour pellets and their impact on the expanded product.		Foods					Extrusion can lead to an expanded product or to a slightly expanded pellet, known as a third-generation (3G) snack. In this case, expansion occurs subsequently, in an independent thermal device (e.g., oven), out of the extruded pellet. During both processes, several structural changes occur which are linked to processing conditions, including cooking temperature, screw speed, formulation, and initial moisture content. However, a clear relationship between processing variables and the structure of pellets and expanded products has not yet been identified. Accordingly, this work aimed to study the effect of extrusion temperature (110, 135, and 150 °C) and moisture content (27, 29, and 31%) in rice-flour pellets and their microwave expansion, through a microstructural approach using micro-CT. The results showed that the lowest moisture content (27%) and the highest extrusion temperature (150 °C) led to the highest pellet volume and the highest wall thickness, which in turn led to the highest expansion after microwave heating (50 s, 800 W). Interestingly, no significant differences were observed when analyzing the ratio between the volume of the expanded products and the volume of the pellet (~2.4) when using the different processing conditions. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zameer Hussain, S.; Bazila Naseer; Tahiya Qadri; Monica Reshi; Tawheed Amin; Varsha Kanojia							Development and evaluation of continuous inshelled walnut processing system.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Walnut is one of the high yielding fruit crops grown in union territory of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in India. However, processing of walnuts in J&K is being carried out manually, which is very tedious, troublesome, and time and labor consuming. Thus, the present work was undertaken with an aim to develop a single mechanized continuous system for post-harvest handling and processing of walnuts. The innovation composed of dehulling, bleaching, washing, drying, and grading units, besides conveyors to carry walnuts from one unit to another. The dehulling efficiency (95.70%), bleaching efficiency (96.28%), washing efficiency (99.10%), and grading efficiency (97.43%) recorded for the developed system are much higher than the manual processing. Furthermore, number of partially dehulled, un-dehulled, partially bleached, unbleached, and damaged walnut percentages were recorded significantly (p<0.05) lower whereas fully dehulled and fully bleached walnut percentages were recorded significantly (p<0.05) higher in case of developed system as compared with manual processing. Overall capacity and efficiency of the developed system were recorded as 800kg/day and 97.02%, respectively. The labor requirement for processing 1ton of walnuts using developed system was determined to be 10 man h. The economic analysis indicated that adoption of developed system for walnut processing can be highly beneficial and economic. Thus, developed system can be a feasible alternative to minimize the post-harvest losses, to maintain the quality, and to overcome the drudgery, boredom, and constraints associated with manual post-harvest handling and processing of walnuts. Practical Applications. Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has the largest share in India's total walnut production. However, from the last few years, there has been a setback to the export trade potential of walnuts in India, mainly due to import of walnuts from China and California. The walnuts from California and China have better consumer acceptability than walnuts of J&K, which has badly affected the walnut trade in India. In J&K, post-harvest handling of walnuts is being done manually without any scientific and mechanical arbitration, which leads to quality deterioration of walnuts. Therefore, in order to compete at international level, there is an immediate need to shift the post-harvest handling of walnuts from manual to mechanized. Thus, the adoption of developed continuous inshelled walnut processing system can play a vital role in sustaining the rural economy of J&K through production and sale of good quality walnuts. Furthermore, the developed system can serve as a benchmark for establishment of modern walnut processing units, which can lead to employment generation and boost the walnut trade in J&K. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	6			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13986					FSTA:2022-10-Js13327

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The biosynthesis of 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) in bell pepper fruits (Capsicum annuum L.) was investigated by in vivo feeding experiments with stable isotope-labeled precursors. Volatiles were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and analyzed by comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC * GC) coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ToF-MS). Feeding experiments revealed incorporation of L-leucine and alpha-ketoisocaproic acid (alpha-KIC) as well as glycine and glyoxylic acid into IBMP. Furthermore, it has been shown that de novo biosynthesis of IBMP occurs in pericarp tissues of unripe bell pepper fruits, whereas pericarp tissues of ripe bell pepper fruits showed no capability of IBMP biosynthesis.

J		Zamora, R.; Hidalgo, F. J.							Carbonyl-trapping abilities of 5-alkylresorcinols.		Food Chemistry					In an attempt to investigate the carbonyl-trapping abilities of 5-alkylresorcinols, this study describes the role of these compounds in inhibiting the formation of the 2,5-dialkylpyridines (5-ethyl-2-methylpyridine, 5-butyl-2-propylpyridine, and 5-hexyl-2-pentylpyridine) produced by 2-alkenals (crotonaldehyde, 2-hexenal, and 2-octenal) in the presence of ammonia. 5-Alkylresorcinols (as well as orcinol and olivetol) inhibited the formation of pyridines to an extend that depended on the 2-alkenal involved and the reaction conditions. This inhibition was consequence of the trapping of 2-alkenals by the phenolics. Thus, the major adducts produced between the C21:0 alkylresorcinol and crotonaldehyde were isolated and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS). These results confirm that, in addition to their free radical scavenging abilities, 5-alkylresorcinols also trap reactive carbonyls. Because trapped carbonyls are involved in the formation of flavors and processing-induced antioxidants, 5-alkylresorcinols might be implied in some of the observed differences between whole and refined grain products.

Modified fermented sausages with olive oil oleogel and NaCl-KCl substitution for improved nutritional quality.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of partial substitution of pork backfat by olive oil oleogel and NaCl by KCl on the technological and nutritional characteristics of fermented sausages was studied. Four formulations of fermented sausages were evaluated: control (C) with 18g pork backfat and 1.5g NaCl per 100g; treatment (N) with 50% NaCl substituted by KCl; treatment (O) with 50% pork backfat substituted by oleogel; and treatment (D) with 50% simultaneous substitution of NaCl and pork backfat by KCl and oleogel. Selected physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of the formulations were measured on 0, 1, 4, 7 and 14 d after manufacture. Treatment (D) had higher water activity and exhibited lower weight loss. Sensory evaluation was performed by a nine-member trained panel and differences among treatments were identified in color and textural attributes, but not in flavor, bitterness, saltiness. According to a 54-member consumer panel, treatment (O) was judged as second best in personal preference, following treatment (C). After fermentation and ripening of the sausages, treatment (D) had 51.9% less sodium, 19.2% less cholesterol and 17.8% less saturated fatty acid content than (C). The results show that it is possible to produce sensorially acceptable and microbiologically safe fermented sausages with a healthier nutritional profile.

Crystalline microstructure and physicochemical properties of olive oil oleogels formulated with monoglycerides and phytosterols.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Edible oleogels are oils structured with non-triglyceride networks, that can be used as alternative solid-like fats. The formation of olive oil oleogels structured with monoglycerides (10%, 15% and 20% MGs) and 15% MGs in combination with 5% phytosterols (PS) was investigated. Effects of storage time (0-14 d) and temperature (-20 °C, 5 °C and 25 °C) on physicochemical properties of oleogels were probed by polarized light microscopy, large deformation mechanical measurements (hardness, gel strength), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The inclusion of 5% PS into a MG-olive oil based (15%) matrix enhanced the hardness and gel strength of the PS-MG composite oleogels, due to the fact that the PS prevented a high-level organization of MGs, as evidenced by reduced melting enthalpy values, compared to oleogels formulated solely with MGs. The 15% MGs-5% PS oleogels stored at -20 °C exhibited the strongest mechanical properties throughout storage. A gradual transformation of the crystalline morphology (sub-alpha to beta-crystals) was also observed over time, as probed by microscopy and FTIR analysis. The rate of these changes was faster at higher storage temperatures due to enhanced mobility of the MG molecules.

Identification of antidiabetic peptides derived from in silico hydrolysis of three ancient grains: amaranth, Quinoa and Chia.		Food Chemistry					The antidiabetic potential of bioactive peptides derived from simulated gastrointestinal digestion (SGID) of proteins present in amaranth quinoa and chia was evaluated using their bioactivity profile and theoretical interaction with DPP-IV and alpha-glucosidases. In silico SGID generated 52 different fragments with in vitro antidiabetic activity where fragments PW, PF, PPG, PM, SW, IW, SF, PP, PPL, PG, PY, VW and PL scored highly in bioactivity probability, with molecular weights ranging from 172.2 to 325.44 Da; positive bulkiness index and hydrophobicity (except PP and PY) and no toxic properties. Fragments IW and PW presented the lowest free energy values for enzymes DPP-IV, maltase-glucoamylase, pancreatic alpha-amylase and sucrase-isomaltase (-8.2, -7.5, -7.7 and -7.5 kcal/mol; and -7.8, -7.4, -8.2, -7.4 kcal/mol respectively) We can conclude that proteins from amaranth, quinoa and chia may be a good source of antidiabetic BP and may exert antidiabetic activity through the release of BP after digestion.

J		Zan Meng; Tong Wang; Ullah Malik, A.; Qingguo Wang							Exogenous isoleucine can confer browning resistance on fresh-cut potato by suppressing polyphenol oxidase activity and improving the antioxidant capacity.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Fresh-cut potatoes are susceptible to enzymatic browning. In this study, the effect of isoleucine (Ile) on the browning of fresh-cut potatoes was evaluated, and the mechanism by which Ile influenced the browning was revealed. Results showed that exogenous Ile application could reduce the browning of fresh-cut potato chips. At 2-4°C, control chips had lost saleability on day 1, while 1.0% Ile treated chips were still acceptable on day 4. Ile alleviated the decrease of tyrosine, prevented the production of brown pigments, and inhibited the browning of potato mashes. The addition of Ile to potato mash decreased polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which was partially recovered after adding copper acetate. Molecular docking showed that Ile could bind with the amino acid residues of PPO. Moreover, Ile treatment increased the activity of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), improved 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) inhibition rate, and decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. This is the first research to demonstrate that Ile has potential to be used as a natural anti-browning agent and its mechanisms include decreasing PPO activity by chelating Cu2+ and interacting with the PPO amino acid residues, and improving the antioxidant capacity.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					This study investigated the prevalence of Salmonella in 210 retail meat samples (105 raw chicken and 105 raw pork) collected from supermarkets and wet markets in 13 areas of Hebei Province, China, from June to October 2018. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on all 125 Salmonella isolates to investigate their genetic relationship. Core genome multilocus sequence typing of 77 representative isolates was used to further elucidate the genetic relatedness among the Salmonella isolated from retail meat. The mean detection rate of Salmonella in all samples was 59.5% (125/210). The prevalence of Salmonella was 53.3% (56/105) in chicken and 65.7% (69/105) in pork. Chicken and pork samples collected in July had the highest detection rate of Salmonella among the sampling months. The isolates were assigned to 19 serotypes, with S. Derby, S. London, and S. Thompson being the most frequent serotypes. Resistance to tetracycline (primarily used for the treatment of bacterial infections) was observed in 89.6% of the isolates, and 84.0% were resistant to doxycycline (also a tetracycline antibiotic) or gemifloxacin (commonly used for clinical treatment of human acute bronchitis). More than 80% of the isolates were multidrug resistant. A total of 21 sequence types were identified. Sequence type 40 (ST-40), the predominant genotype among all isolates, was found only in pork; the sequence types of chicken isolates were more diverse. A total of 58 different antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were detected in the 125 isolates. Most types of ARGs were associated with aminoglycoside and beta-lactam resistance. Nevertheless, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(A) was the most frequently occurring ARG in all isolates at 78.4%. Multiple isolates of ST-26 contained 20 ARGs. All isolates of ST-40 were divided into two clusters, with at least 160 allelic differences between them. The findings highlight the need to continually monitor ARGs in foodborne Salmonella with particular emphasis on ST-40 and ST-26; the monitoring should include as many retail meat types as possible in the study area.

Single-staining flow cytometry approach using SYTOX green to describe electroporation effects on Escherichia coli.		Food Control					Pulsed electric fields (PEF) can induce reversible or irreversible electroporation effects on bacterial cells resulting in sublethally or lethally injured cells. Hereafter, an alternative single-staining flow cytometry approach with SYTOX Green (SYTOX) is proposed, allowing for a straightforward and rapid screening of electroporation effects. SYTOX-staining indicated 38-63% of E. coli cells with intermediate cellular changes, likely being sublethally injured, at electric field intensities of 8 kV/cm-18 kV/cm. Compared to staining with propidium iodide, SYTOX showed a brighter fluorescence intensity, allowing for easier differentiation of subpopulations. The proportion of intermediate injury observed with SYTOX was distinctly higher than the sublethal damage detected with conventional plating on selective media (31-45%). It is, however, challenging to compare selective plating with the single-staining method based on membrane integrity, suggesting different analytical methods to indicate complex cellular states and sublethal effects.

T. da	Zanetta, L. d'						Consumer risk perceptions concerning different consequences of foodborne disease acquired from food consumed away from home: a case study in Brazil.		Food Control					Foodborne diseases (FBD) generate a substantial burden on society and individual; however, it is not clear how consumers perceive the impact of different consequences of FBD on individual lifestyles. This study aims to investigate consumer risk perceptions of FBD, considering different consequences and scenarios. A cross-sectional study was carried out with 150 consumers from ten restaurants in Brazil. Consumers were interviewed in the restaurant post-food consumption to determine the personal risk of experiencing FBD. The restaurant food safety measures was assessed using a validated checklist. A FBD risk score was calculated. Ten questions were used to assess consumers' risk perceptions. The likelihood perception (L) of FBD was measured according to three contexts: actual restaurant of food consumption, another restaurant, and the consumers' home. The consequences (C) of FBD on consumers' lifestyle were measured considering the impact on financial, performance, social, physical, psychological, and time aspects. Thus, 21 measures of cumulative risk perception (3L x 7C) were established. Findings indicated that consumers perceived the likelihood of FBD as low, mainly when considering food consumed at the actual restaurant and home. It is noted that risk perception was determined as higher when considering performance, physical, and time consequences. There was no association between the risk assessment determined for the restaurant and consumer risk perceptions from such restaurants. Consumers were skeptical about their personal likelihood of experiencing FBD, unaware of the actual risk associated with FDB. However, consumers consider that the impact of FBD on their performance, physical, and time is relevant. In a multidimensional way the risk assessment could be helpful to understand consumer behavior relating to food and restaurant choices. Understanding consumer fears and perceptions generate invaluable insight and data that can be used to develop targeted educational campaigns and food safety strategies.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The current study describes design and synthesis of silica-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles containing Ponceau 4R food colorant (named as ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R). The interactions of Ponceau 4R and ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R with calf thymus-DNA were investigated It should be noted that the competitive binding experiment revealed that both Ponceau 4R and ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R could release Hoechst 33258. As inferred from the results the binding of the Ponceau 4R and ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R with DNA were surface binding, mainly due to groove binding. Furthermore, antibacterial properties of ZnO, Ponceau 4R and ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R samples against gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria were examined and the resulting data were compared with the known antibiotic tetracycline. Interestingly, in most cases Ponceau 4R performs antimicrobial activities better than tetracycline that it is important for food preservation containing this colorant. In addition, the ZnO@SiO2@APTMS/P4R exhibited good antimicrobial effectiveness not only to Gram-positive but also to Gram-negative bacteria. Novelty impact statement. The silica-coated zinc oxide nanoparticles containing Ponceau 4R have been synthesized and fully characterized by FT-IR, TEM, TGA, XRD, SEM/EDX and Zeta potential analysis. The results showed that the Ponceau 4R food colorant and the nanoparticles interact with calf thymus-DNA as groove binders. Interestingly, Ponceau 4R performs excellent antibacterial activities against both gram-positive and gram-negative in comparison to tetracycline and it is important for food preservation containing this colorant. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16222					FSTA:2022-05-Tb1958
J		Zanin, L. M.; Luning, P. A.; Stedefeldt, E.							A roadmap for developing educational actions using food safety culture assessment - a case of an institutional food service.		Food Research International					Food safety (FS) culture has been recognised as a phenomenon that can shape food safety behaviour. Specific educational actions can improve food safety behaviour. This study aimed to build a roadmap to guide the development of educational actions based on the assessment of the prevailing FS-culture. The study was conducted in an institutional food service in the Brazilian air force. A previously-developed mixed-methods and data triangulation approach was used to assess the FS-culture based on eight elements (leadership, communication, knowledge, commitment, risk perception, work pressure and normative beliefs, work environment, and management systems, styles, and process). The roadmap was designed based on a combination of the FS-culture element score (1-reactive, 2-active, and 3-proactive) and priority levels (highest, moderate, lowest, and no priority) of proposed topics to be included in educational actions. Such topics were based on specific literature about food safety culture and the behaviour of food handlers. The FS-culture diagnosis in the air force food service demonstrated an "active to proactive" FS-culture; the element "work pressure and normative beliefs" showed the highest score (3-proactive), whereas "risk perception" and "management systems, styles, and process" indicated the lowest scores (1-2-reactive to active). Based on the weaknesses and strengths in the prevailing FS-culture, the roadmap revealed that the topics showing the lowest scores, "risk perception" and "management systems, styles, and process, " had the highest priority to be included in the educational actions. The designed roadmap may support food services in making decisions about food safety education towards a proactive FS-culture.

Physicochemical characteristics, GABA content, antimicrobial and antioxidant capacities of yogurt from Murrah buffalo milk with different fat contents.		Food Bioscience					This study aimed to prepare yogurt from Murrah buffalo milk with high GABA content and low fat content while keeping the physicochemical characteristics, antimicrobial effects, and antioxidant capacity within acceptable levels. Yogurt samples were prepared using buffalo milk by adjusting the fat content to 0.2%, 3.5%, and 6.5%. The results showed that the fat content had no significant effects on the pH, titratable acidity, water activity, and cell viability. However, the fat content significantly affected the viscosity, particle size, and texture profile analysis of the yogurt. The GABA content was significantly higher in the 0.2% fat yogurt (61.57 3.22mmol L-1) compared to the 3.5% fat yogurt (43.64 1.99mmol L-1) and 6.5% fat yogurt (27.84 2.64mmol L-1). Glutamic acid and proline were the most abundant amino acids in the yogurt. In contrast, saturated fatty acids (butyric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, and oleic) and linoleic acid were abundant. Yogurt with 3.5% fat showed significantly high antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial effects on E. Coli O157 and Salmonella sp. based on the results, fat content significantly affects the rheological properties, GABA content, and antioxidant and antimicrobial capacities of yogurt. In the future, 3.5% fat should be chosen as the optimized formula for large-scale yogurt production from Murrah buffalo milk.

J		Zannou, O.; Koca, I.							Greener extraction of anthocyanins and antioxidant activity from blackberry (Rubus spp) using natural deep eutectic solvents.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Natural deep eutectic solvents (NaDESs) are new green solvents used for the extraction of phenolic compounds. In this work, an efficient and greener strategy for extracting blackberry anthocyanins using NADESs was investigated. Sixteen NADESs constituted of choline chloride-urea, choline chloride-sugars, choline chloride-organic acids, choline chloride-polyalcohols and organic acids-sugars were synthesized. The antioxidant properties and anthocyanin profile of blackberry extracts obtained with NADESs and conventional solvents (water, methanol and ethanol) were evaluated. Results. Of the characterization of NADESs showed that the viscosity, pH, electric conductivity and chemical structure of NADESs were greatly influenced by the hydrogen bond acceptors and hydrogen bond donors. The highest recovery efficiencies were recorded with NADESs giving the highest total phenolic content (9.350.39 mg GAE/G), total flavonoid content (104.725.17 mg ECE/100g), total anthocyanin content (115.370.43), antiradical activity (68.772.29 mmol TE/g), reducing power (83.083.78) and metal chelating activity (4771.2583.58 mg TE/100g). NADESs were the most prominent solvents for the recovery of the targeted anthocyanins, with the more acidic NADESs extracting higher quantities of cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-rutinoside, cyanidin chloride and pelargonidin-3-glucoside. A greener extraction using NADES can therefore effectively and reliably targets antioxidants and particularly anthocyanins in blackberry, offering promising ways for future investigations on the phytochemicals in plants.

Pre-harvest strategy for reducing aflatoxin accumulation during storage of maize in Argentina.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Maize (Zea mays L.) is an important crop in Argentina. Aspergillus flavus may infect this crop at growing stage and the harvested kernels can be contaminated with aflatoxins (AFs), whose levels may increase during storage. In Argentina, silo bags, a hermetic type of storage system, are widely used. Biocontrol based on competitive exclusion by atoxigenic A. flavus strains is a useful tool for AFs management at pre-harvest stage. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of pre-harvest biocontrol treatments on aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) accumulation in maize stored in silo bags during 3 and 6 months. Three bioformulations based on A. flavus AFCHG2 and ARG5/30 strains were applied during field trials as single and mixed inocula. Harvested kernels were stored in non-hermetic and hermetic silo bags. At initial time (t), 3 and 6 months (t3 and t6) the following parameters were evaluated: percentage of damaged kernels, moisture content, water activity, Aspergillus section Flavi incidence, relative humidity, O2 and CO2 levels into the silo bags, and AFB1 levels. The biocontrol strains included in the 3 bioformulations were able to infect maize kernels during the field trial and displaced native toxigenic isolates. At t control plots showed 10.9 0.4mug/kg of AFB1 while no AFs were detected in all the treatments. Along the storage assay AFB1 levels varied from not detected (<1mug/kg) to 20.1 0.8mug/kg. Hermetic bags were better than non-hermetic bags in preventing AFB1 accumulation. Both single and mixed inocula were effective to control AFB1 accumulation in maize kernels during 3 and 6months. AFB1 was not detected in kernels from the treatment at field stage with AFCHG2 + ARG5/30 after 6 months of storage into hermetic bags. The application of the biocontrol agents at field stage is an appropriate tool to reduce AFB1 accumulation under storage in hermetic silo bags. This is the first report on biocontrol strategy based on native atoxigenic strains applied at pre-harvest stage to reduce AFB1 accumulation during storage in Argentina.

J		Zapasnik, A.; Sokolowska, B.; Bryla, M.							Role of lactic acid bacteria in food preservation and safety.		Foods					Fermentation of various food stuffs by lactic acid bacteria is one of the oldest forms of food biopreservation. Bacterial antagonism has been recognized for over a century, but in recent years, this phenomenon has received more scientific attention, particularly in the use of various strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB). Certain strains of LAB demonstrated antimicrobial activity against foodborne pathogens, including bacteria, yeast and filamentous fungi. Furthermore, in recent years, many authors proved that lactic acid bacteria have the ability to neutralize mycotoxin produced by the last group. Antimicrobial activity of lactic acid bacteria is mainly based on the production of metabolites such as lactic acid, organic acids, hydroperoxide and bacteriocins. In addition, some research suggests other mechanisms of antimicrobial activity of LAB against pathogens as well as their toxic metabolites. These properties are very important because of the future possibility to exchange chemical and physical methods of preservation with a biological method based on the lactic acid bacteria and their metabolites. Biopreservation is defined as the extension of shelf life and the increase in food safety by use of controlled microorganisms or their metabolites. This biological method may determine the alternative for the usage of chemical preservatives. In this study, the possibilities of the use of lactic acid bacteria against foodborne pathogens is provided. Our aim is to yield knowledge about lactic acid fermentation and the activity of lactic acid bacteria against pathogenic microorganisms. In addition, we would like to introduce actual information about health aspects associated with the consumption of fermented products, including probiotics. © 2022 by the authors.

Pilot study for the dietary assessment of xenobiotics derived from food processing in an adult Spanish sample.		Foods					Background. Although xenobiotics from food processing have gained support as possible drivers of the relationship between diet and some types of cancer, there are still few studies characterizing the intake of these compounds among different populations. Aim. To describe the intake of heterocyclic amines (HAs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nitrates, nitrites, nitrosamines, and acrylamide; and to identify dietary and lifestyle related factors. Methods. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study in 70 adult volunteers. Intake was registered by means of a food frequency questionnaire, including cooking methods, temperature, and degree of browning. The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) and the Computerized Heterocyclic Amines Resource for Research in Epidemiology of Disease (CHARRED) databases were used for xenobiotic estimation in conjunction with data from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Results. Dietary HAs (amino-alpha-carboline (AalphaC), 2-amino-3-methylimidazo (4,5, f) quinoline (IQ), 2-amino-3,8 dimethylimidazo (4,5, f) quinoxaline (MeIQx), 2-amino-3,4, 8 trime-thylimidazo (4,5, f) quinoxaline (DiMeIQx), and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo (4,5, b) pyridine (PhIP)) were mainly derived from meat and meat products, while benzo (a) pyrene (B (a) P), dibenzo (a) anthracene (DiB (a) A), and total PAHs were explained by oils and fats, alcoholic beverages, and milk, respectively. Microwaved, fried, grilled, broiled, barbecued, and braised cooking methods were mainly responsible for HAs and PAHs consumption. Conclusion. Based on the wide presence and levels of intake of these compounds in different sources, more efforts should be made to adjust their intake to the levels recommended by health agencies. © 2022 by the authors.

Commercially acquired acai pulps contamination by Trypanosoma cruzi.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The etiological agent of Chagas disease is the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. According to the World Health Organization, about seven to eight million people are infected with T. cruzi worldwide. The main routes of transmission are vectorial and oral, which has assumed great epidemiological importance, since there is no legislation that requires the pasteurization of acai pulp. The present work aimed to look T. cruzi in 35 samples of acai ice cream sold at different points of sale, covering 11 different cities in Sao Paulo State. Thus, the parasitological technique of forced sieving and the molecular test of Polymerase Chain Reaction were performed. For PCR analysis were used the 121/122 primer that amplifies the kinetoplast of the T. cruzi DNA (kDNA). By the forced sieving technique, the acai pulp aliquots were analyzed under different storage temperatures and in different periods. One positive sample (2.86%) were observed at six hours at room temperature, but without motility and negative to the PCR technique. Two other acai samples (5.71%) were positive by PCR, but negative by forced sieving. The results indicate the need for quality control and good manufacturing practices for the safe consumption of acai-derived products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Genetic parameters and analysis of factors affecting variations between backfat and Semimembranosus muscle fatty acid composition in heavy pigs.		Meat Science					This study was conceived to evaluate the variations between backfat (BF) and Semimembranosus (SM) muscle fatty acid (FA) composition in 789 heavy pigs and to estimate the genetic and phenotypic correlations and the heritability values of these variations. Most FAs showed a common genetic basis controlling their proportion in SM muscle and BF, while the n-6/n-3 ratio, alpha-linolenic and erucic acids displayed a genetic control more oriented towards tissue-specific molecular pathways. All variations between the FA composition of BF and SM muscle showed low-to-medium heritability values, suggesting that there are also genetic mechanisms capable of differentiating the deposition of FAs in BF from those in SM muscle. This result implies that a better knowledge of the genes differentiating the FA composition of BF and SM muscle could provide new tools allowing to select, in a partially independent manner, the FA composition of muscle and subcutaneous fat.

Describing backfat and Semimembranosus muscle fatty acid variability in heavy pigs: analysis of non-genetic factors.		Meat Science					This study aimed to describe the multivariate structure of Semimembranosus muscle and backfat fatty acid (FA) composition in 798 Italian Large White heavy pigs and to investigate the effects of environmental factors and carcass characteristics on FA variations. The total FA variability in muscle and backfat was characterized by a negative correlation between saturated and polyunsaturated FAs, which strongly depended on the carcass adiposity. Slaughtering season was also relevant, with pigs slaughtered in autumn having more n-6 FAs and eicosadienoic acid in backfat, while pigs slaughtered in winter displayed more saturated FAs. Regarding Semimembranosus muscle, pigs with heavier belly cuts and slaughtered in autumn had higher proportions of cis-vaccenic and palmitoleic acids, while those slaughtered in summer had more saturated FAs. Slaughtering season emerged as a relevant factor shaping both backfat and muscle FA composition, indicating that more studies and attention should be paid to environmental factors, which may have effects on FA metabolism and deposition in finishing pigs.

Influence of a biological coating and a wax on postharvest quality of mango (Mangifera indica L) variety "Keitt".		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Mango (Mangifera indica L) is one of the most important tropical fruits worldwide; however, being a climacteric fruit, its postharvest deterioration is rapid, which implies that the presence of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloesporioides and the long storage periods for its commercialization affect the shelf life of the fruit. The objective of this research was to evaluate the effect of three concentrations of a shellac-based wax and three concentrations of a biological coating (bioprotectant) made with Bacillus spp. and Streptomyces spp. As coatings for the preservation of physicochemical and microbiological quality parameters in Keitt mangoes stored for 35 days at 7°C 3. Mangoes with 0.5% bioprotectant and 30% wax showed an incidence of 40% up to day 35, which was significantly lower than that reported for the control group (80%). In the physicochemical parameters, the 30% wax preserved firmness, maintained a weight loss percentage of less than 10% during 35 days and presented the lowest pH values and the highest percentages of citric acid as of day 21 of storage, and the 0.5% bioprotectant in the variables of pH, total soluble solids and titratable acidity were similar to those reported in the control group; firmness was not affected during the days of storage. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Phytochemical characterisation, in vitro antioxidant and antidiabetic activity of Rosa arvensis Huds. extracts.		Food Bioscience					In this study, the chemical composition, antioxidant, and hypoglycemic activity of Rosa arvensis Huds. Leaves and fruits collected from Zlatibor, Zeljin, Veliki Krs mountains and Petnica village (Serbia) were analysed. Phenolic and vitamin profiles, as well as in vitro antioxidant potential and enzyme inhibitory activity on alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase, were studied. Phytochemical analysis showed higher phenolic content in leaf extracts than in those obtained from fruits. Gallic, chlorogenic and syringic acids were the most abundant phenolic acids, while catechin was the major flavonoid compound. Furthermore, the highest level of alpha-tocopherol (1.94mg/100g fw) in achenes and ascorbic acid (9.60mg/100g fw) in hypanthium were quantified in the fruits sampled on the Veliki Krs Mt. High antioxidant capacity was observed for the leaf extracts. It was highly correlated with their chemical composition and primarily referred to the catechin content (r > 0.95, p< 0.01), while the quinic acid had the opposite effect (r >-0.97, p< 0.01). Leaf extracts also showed good alpha-glucosidase and moderate alpha-amylase inhibitory potential in contrast to hypanthium and achenes extracts with lower antidiabetic activity. The high phenolic content and noted antioxidative potential were strongly correlated with the alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity (r > 0.80, p< 0.01), while the alpha-amylase inhibition was only moderately correlated with those compounds (r > 0.49, p< 0.01). Among the tested R. arvensis samples, those from Zlatibor Mt. Contained the highest amount of target compounds and expressed the highest biological activity. The obtained results suggest that R. arvensis extracts present a new source of bioactive compounds that could be implemented as novel food ingredients. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					This study examines the ability of fluorescence spectroscopy for monitoring the quality of 70 Moroccan virgin olive oils belonging to three varieties and originating from three regions of Morocco. By applying principal component analysis and factorial discriminant analysis to the emission spectra acquired after excitation wavelengths set at 270, 290, and 430 nm, a clear differentiation between samples according to their storage time was observed. The obtained results were confirmed following the application of four multivariate classification methods: partial least squares regression, principal component regression, support vector machine, and multiple linear regression on the emission spectra. The best prediction model of storage time was obtained by applying partial least squares regression since a coefficient of determination (R2) and a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.98 and 24.85 days were observed, respectively. The prediction of the chemical parameters allowed to obtain excellent validation models with R2 ranging between 0.98 and 0.99 for free acidity, peroxide value, chlorophyll level, k232, and k270.

Journal of Food Science					The aim of the present work was to optimize the formulation of a new functional pasta containing durum wheat semolina, whole barley flour, and inulin ingredients to enhance both the technological and textural properties of this product using the mixture design approach. Optimally formulated pasta with acceptable technological and textural properties as close as possible to those of control pasta was studied. The microstructure analysis of cooked and uncooked pasta was performed. Cox response trace plots revealed that the increasing amounts of whole barley flour and durum wheat semolina resulted in an increase in the cooking quality parameters and yellowness. However, pasta firmness was negatively influenced by inulin and whole barley flour addition. The ingredient composition of the optimally formulated pasta, which leads to the best technological and textural properties, was 94.8% durum wheat semolina, 3.7% whole barley flour, and 1.5% inulin. This optimal formulation had an optimal cooking time of 335.24 s, a swelling index of 2.15%, and a cooking loss of 10.44%. The firmness values and the color parameters were also satisfactory. The microstructure of the optimally formulated cooked pasta showed the presence of few not gelatinized starch granules incorporated into the protein matrix as compared to the control pasta. Practical Application. Three ingredients, durum wheat semolina, whole barley flour, and inulin, were used for the production of new functional pasta using a mixture design approach. The obtained optimally formulated pasta, with good technological and textural properties, was rich in several dietary fibers. This allows the application of whole barley flour and inulin in the cereal industry and can be of interest to the human diet. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

High pressure processing, acidic and osmotic stress increased resistance to aminoglycosides and tetracyclines and the frequency of gene transfer among strains from commercial starter and protective cultures.		Food Microbiology					This study analyzed the effect of food-related stresses on the expression of antibiotic resistance of starter and protective strains and resistance gene transfer frequency. After exposure to high-pressure processing, acidic and osmotic stress, the expression of genes encoding resistance to aminoglycosides (aac (6') Ie-aph (2") Ia and aph (3')-IIIa) and/or tetracyclines (tetM) increased. After cold stress, a decrease in the expression level of all tested genes was observed. The results obtained in the gene expression analysis correlated with the results of the phenotype patterns. After acidic and osmotic stresses, a significant increase in the frequency of each gene transfer was observed. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study focused on changes in antibiotic resistance associated with a stress response among starter and protective strains. The results suggest that the physicochemical factors prevailing during food production and storage may affect the phenotype of antibiotic resistance and the level of expression of antibiotic resistance genes among microorganisms. As a result, they can contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance. This points to the need to verify strains used in the food industry for their antibiotic resistance to prevent them from becoming a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes.

Effects of osmotic and high pressure stress on expression of virulence factors among Enterococcus spp. isolated from food of animal origin.		Food Microbiology					The aim of study was to determine the occurrence of virulence factors and virulence-related genes among enterococci isolated from food of animal origin and effects of osmotic and high pressure stress on expression of virulence-related genes. The number of 78 isolates were analyzed. None of them showed a strong ability to form biofilm, 38.5% (n = 30) had the slime production ability, 41% (n = 32) had gelatinase activity, gamma-type hemolysis was observed in 55% of isolates, and alpha-type hemolysis in 45%. All of the isolates carried 1-13 virulence-related genes. The most common genes were gelE (85.9%), sprE (78.2%) and asa1 (75.6%). There were also observed changes in the expression of the gelE, esp, asa1 and cylL genes in response to various NaCl concentration and high pressure processing. Results obtained in this study indicate that enterococci isolated from food may act as reservoirs of virulence genes. The presence of virulence factors among enterococci, especially the ability to biofilm formation is important for food safety and the protection of public health.

Linezolid-resistant Enterococcus spp. isolates from foods of animal origin-the genetic basis of acquired resistance.		Foods					Enterococci are important opportunistic pathogens with the capacity to acquire and spread antibiotic resistance. At present, linezolid-resistant enterococci (LRE) pose a great challenge. Linezolid is considered as a last resort antibiotic in the treatment of enterococcal infections, so it is important to monitor the occurrence of LRE in various environments. The aim of this study was to define the genetic mechanisms of linezolid resistance in enterococci (E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. hirae, E. casseliflavus) isolated from foods of animal origin (n = 104). Linezolid resistance (LR) was shown by 26.9% of isolates. All of them displayed linezolid MICs of 8-32 g/mL, and 96.4% of them were multidrug multidrug-resistant. The most common acquired linezolid resistance gene in LR isolates was poxtA (64%), followed by optrA (28%) and cfr (12%). According to the authors' knowledge, this research is the first to indicate the presence of the cfr gene among isolates from food. In 28.6% of the isolates, the point mutation G2576T in the V domain of the 23S rRNA was responsible for linezolid resistance. All isolates harbored the wild-type rplC, rplD and rplV genes. The obtained results indicate that linezolid resistance among enterococci in animal-derived food may result from various genetic mechanisms. The most worrying is that this resistance is encoded on mobile genetic elements, so there is a risk of its rapid transmission, even despite the lack of selective pressure resulting from the use of antibiotics. © 2022 by the authors.

Microorganisms from starter and protective cultures - occurrence of antibiotic resistance and conjugal transfer of tet genes in vitro and during food fermentation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study analyzed antibiotic resistance and the occurrence of resistance genes in strains from starter and protective cultures. The largest number of obtained strains belonged to the genus Lactobacillus (n=26; 44.9%), followed by Lactococcus (n=17; 29.3%), Pediococcus (n=8; 13.8%), Streptococcus (n=4; 6.9%), Staphylococcus (n=2; 3.4%) and Leuconostoc (n=1; 1.7%). Among all strains, the highest Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were noted for tetracycline (max. >256 mug/ml), kanamycin (max. 48 mug/ml) and chloramphenicol (max. 32 mug/ml). The most common resistance genes were aph (3)-IIIa (n=35; 60.3%) and cat (n=32; 55.2%). Strains derived from starter and protective cultures have the ability to horizontally transfer resistance genes in vitro and in situ. It should be noted that antibiotic resistance of bacteria from starter and protective cultures does not present an immediate risk to consumers. However, these microorganisms could become an environmental reservoir of antibiotic resistance. The obtained results indicate that antibiotic resistance in starter and protective cultures is not a critical issue, however it creates a concern that cannot be ignored.

Effect of Moldavian dragonhead seed residue on the baking properties of wheat flour and bread quality.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of adding defatted Moldavian dragonhead seed residue flour (MDF) at concentrations of 3-12% (w/w flour basis) to wheat flour on dough rheology and bread quality was investigated in the present study. The farinograph characteristics show that supplementation of the wheat flour dough with MDF increases water absorption and dough softening but decreases the stability time. Regarding the effect on bread properties, the addition of MDF increased the bread yield and decreased baking loss, porosity, taste, and bread volume compared to the control (100% wheat flour). In addition, the partial replacement of wheat flour with MDF had a significant effect (p≤0.05) on hardness and chewiness; both these textural indices were increased. A significant reduction in lightness (L*) and yellowness (b*) and an increase in redness (a*) induced by the MDF addition were observed in the bread crumb. Therefore, MDF at the concentration up to 6 g/100 g can be used to produce bread with good consumer acceptance. We found that the 6 g/100 g MDF addition to the bread formula provided an increase of 59% in dietary fiber, 32% in fat, and 50% in minerals, with significantly lower carbohydrate content and energy value compared to the control.

Food Bioscience					Co-microcapsules were prepared through spray drying of double emulsions of L. rhamnosus and krill oil, using whey protein as wall material. At all tested drying process temperatures, viability of the microcapsules and co-microcapsules above 1 * 1010 CFU/mL was achieved. The main phospholipid detected in the co-microcapsules were phosphatidylethanolamine. The fatty acids profile of the co-microcapsules revealed a low content of saturated fatty acids (SFA) and a high content of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). The survivability of L. rhamnosus was evaluated during the storage of the co-microcapsules at different temperatures (4 and 25°C) and relative humidities (10-93%). It was found that increasing the storage temperature decreases the range of water activity in which the viability of the probiotic remains stable in the co-microcapsules. The co-microencapsulates developed provide omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics with less impact on its functional properties.

Beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on glucose and triglycerides in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome.		Journal of Functional Foods					The present study aimed to examine the effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus Rosell 11 and Lactobacillus helveticus Rosell 52 on glucose (blood level and tolerance), lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), transaminases (AST and ALT), ALP, urea, and creatinine, along with body weight, food intake, liquid consumption, and gross pathology in a mouse model of metabolic syndrome. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat high-sucrose diet and treated by oral gavage with a probiotic mixture in three different concentrations (107, 108, and 109 CFU/mL) once daily for 2 months. Probiotic supplementation, particularly at a concentration of 109 CFU, significantly decreased blood glucose and serum triglyceride levels, improved glucose tolerance, and promoted body weight loss in mice fed a high-fat high-sucrose diet. According to the obtained results, probiotic supplementation is useful for controlling glucose and triglyceride levels and could be used as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Berry by-products in combination with antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria strains for the sustainable formulation of chewing candies.		Foods					The purpose of this research was to develop formulations of chewing candies (CCs) in a sustainable manner by using berry by-products in combination with antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains. To implement this aim, the optimal quantities of by-products from lyophilised raspberry (Rasp) and blackcurrant (Bcur) from the juice production industry were selected. Prior to use, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum LUHS135, Liquorilactobacillus uvarum LUHS245, Lacticaseibacillus paracasei LUHS244, and Pediococcus acidilactici LUHS29 strains were multiplied in a dairy industry by-product-milk permeate (MP). The antimicrobial activity of the selected ingredients (berry by-products and LAB) was evaluated. Two texture-forming agents were tested for the CC formulations: gelatin (Gl) and agar (Ag). In addition, sugar was replaced with xylitol. The most appropriate formulation of the developed CCs according to the product's texture, colour, total phenolic compound (TPC) content, antioxidant activity, viable LAB count during storage, overall acceptability (OA), and emotions (EMs) induced in consumers was selected. It was established that the tested LAB inhibited three pathogens out of the 11 tested, while the blackcurrant by-products inhibited all 11 tested pathogens. The highest OA was shown for the CC prepared with gelatin in addition to 5 g of Rasp and 5 g of Bcur by-products. The Rasp and LUHS135 formulation showed the highest TPC content (147.16 mg 100 g-1 d.m.), antioxidant activity (88.2%), and LAB count after 24 days of storage (6.79 log10 CFU g-1). Finally, it was concluded that Gl, Rasp and Bcur by-products, and L. plantarum LUHS135multiplied in MP are promising ingredients for preparing CCs in a sustainable manner; the best CC formula consisted of Gl, Rasp by-products, and LUHS135 and showed the highest OA (score 9.52) and induced the highest intensity of the EM "happy" (0.231). © 2022 by the authors.

Dual functional cholinesterase inhibitors and complexing of aluminum ions of five species of fungi family depended of drying conditions and extraction process - in vitro study.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The nutritional value of mushrooms is not great but, from the dietary point of view, fungi can bring in many beneficial nutrients such as selenium and some vitamins. In addition, a number of compounds of functional importance have been isolated from fungi. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the drying process and extraction process from fruiting bodies of selected edible mushrooms for inhibitory activity against cholinesterases and complexation of aluminium ions Al3+. Such mushrooms as champignon (Agaricus bisporus), oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostereatus), porcini (Boletus edulis), bay bolete (Boletus badius) and golden chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius) were examined. It was shown that the tested samples exhibited inhibitory activity against acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. The extracts also had the ability to complex aluminum ions, with the porcini and oyster mushroom extracts characterized by the highest ability among the samples tested. The activity did not depend on how the extraction process was carried out. Convection drying, however, proved to be a more favorable dehydration method compared to freeze drying in terms of the properties tested. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Increasing calcium phosphate aqueous solubility and spontaneous supersaturation combining citrate and gluconate with perspectives for functional foods.		Food Chemistry					Uptake of calcium from food depends on solubility of calcium salts in the intestines, and precipitation of calcium phosphates decreases bioaccessibility of food calcium. Citrate as a high affinity complex binder for calcium was found spontaneously to create strongly supersaturated solutions by rapid dissolution of calcium hydrogen phosphate characterized by short lag phases for precipitation. Gluconate with weaker affinity for calcium binding showed longer lag phases for precipitation from supersaturated solutions. For citrate/gluconate combinations, the highest degree of supersaturation with longest lag phases for precipitation were found by trial-and-error experiments for a citrate/gluconate ratio of 1:10 for dissolution of calcium hydrogen phosphate resulting in supersaturation factors around three and without precipitation for more than a month. The aim of the present study was to provide a physicochemical explanation of this robust supersaturation. Calcium speciation based on electrochemical calcium activity measurement identified a low [Ca2+].[HCitr2-] product as critical for supersaturation.

Effects of xanthan gum, lambda-carrageenan and psyllium husk on the physical characteristics and glycaemic potency of white bread.		Foods					White bread contains a high proportion of easily digestible starch, which contributes to an undesirable rapid increase in blood glucose concentration. This study investigated the effects of nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP)-xanthan gum, lambda-carrageenan and psyllium husk on the physical functionality and glycaemic potency of white bread. The amount of water for each formulation was adjusted based on DoughLab set at a target torque value of ~500 FU for sufficient dough development. Adding NSP generally resulted in significantly increased loaf volumes and decreased hardness. The glycaemic potency (glycaemic glucose equivalents (GGE) g) of bread was found to be reduced with the addition of NSP at all levels (1, 3 and 5% w/w based on flour weight). Increasing the concentration of xanthan gum and lambda-carrageenan did not show any further decrease in the glycaemic potency. Notably, adding 5% w/w psyllium husk significantly reduced the glycaemic potency from ~49 GGE/100g in the reference bread to 32 GGE/100g. The reduction in the glycaemic potency was attributed to viscosity effects (for xanthan) and starch-NSP interactions (for psyllium husk). Overall, the 5% w/w psyllium husk bread sample was most promising in terms of both physical characteristics and its effect on in vitro glucose release. © 2022 by the authors.

Prevalence and persistence of multidrug-resistant Yersinia enterocolitica 4/O:3 in tonsils of slaughter pigs from different housing systems in Croatia.		Foods					Yersinia enterocolitica is one of the priority biological hazards in pork inspection. Persistence of the pathogen, including strains resistant to antimicrobials, should be evaluated in pigs from different housing systems for risk ranking of farms. In this 2019 study, tonsils were collected from 234 pigs, of which 69 (29.5%) were fattened on 3 big integrated farms, 130 (55.5%) on 10 medium-sized farms, and 35 (15%) on 13 small family farms. In addition, 92 pork cuts and minced meat samples from the same farms were tested for the presence of Y. enterocolitica using the culture method. Phenotypic and genetic characteristics of the isolates were compared with previously collected isolates from 2014. The overall prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in pig tonsils was 43% [95% CI 36.7-49.7]. In pigs from big integrated, medium-sized, and small family farms, the prevalence was 29%, 52%, and 40%, respectively. All retail samples of portioned and minced pork tested negative for pathogenic Y. enterocolitica, likely due to high hygienic standards in slaughterhouses/cutting meat or low sensitivity of culture methods in these matrices. The highest recovery rate of the pathogen from tonsils was found when alkali-treated PSB and CIN agar were combined. The biosecurity category of integrated and medium farms did not affect the differences in prevalence of Y. enterocolitica (p> 0.05), in contrast to family farms. Pathogenic ail-positive Y. enterocolitica biotype 4 serotype O:3 persisted in the tonsils of pigs regardless of the type of farm, slaughterhouse, and year of isolation 2014 and 2019. PFGE typing revealed the high genetic concordance (80.6 to 100%) of all the Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates. A statistically significant higher prevalence of multidrug-resistant Y. enterocolitica 4/O:3 isolates was detected in the tonsils of pigs from big integrated farms compared to the other farm types (p< 0.05), with predominant and increasing resistance to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, and streptomycin. This study demonstrated multidrug resistance of the pathogen in pigs likely due to more antimicrobial pressure on big farms, with intriguing resistance to some clinically relevant antimicrobials used in the treatment of yersiniosis in humans. © 2022 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					The present study investigated the effect of a 4-week high fat low carbohydrate (HFLC-G) versus high carbohydrate low glycaemic (LGI-G) or high glycaemic (HGI-G) diet on power output at lactate thresholds, peak oxygen uptake and peak performance during an incremental cycle test in 28 male endurance athletes. All participants showed improved levels of power output at the lactate thresholds with a more pronounced effect in the HFLC-G and LGI-G. In the HFLC-G peak performance (-11.6 16.3W) decreased, while in the LGI-G (9.20 13.8W) and HGI-G (9.89 12.8W) peak performance increased (p = 0.009). In summary, the LGI-G showed comparable training adaptations as the HFLC-G at submaximal intensities without limiting the ability to perform at high intensities. Compared to a HFLC and HGI diet, the LGI diet in this study seemed to be advantageous during submaximal and high intensities resulting from an improved metabolic flexibility. © 2022 The Author(s).

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The waste of salted egg white resources has always been a serious problem in the food industry. In this current study, we report on a kind of Pickering emulsion system, which was stabilized by duck egg white nanogels (DEWNs) and sodium alginate (SA), followed by which this system was crosslinked by calcium carbonate (CaCO3) via controlling the gluconolactone (GDL) concentrations, aiming to open up a promising route for making full use of these protein resources. Results. The droplet size of the emulsion exhibited a reduction with an increase in SA concentrations, indicating that higher negative charges and steric hindrance was useful for a stable emulsion system. Meanwhile, the result of rheology measurement showed that storage modulus (G′) values were higher than loss modulus (G) values of the samples at higher GDL concentration, revealing the formation of elastic gel-like networks in the system, which was fabricated by SA and Ca2+ released by the CaCO3 particles. The gel-like network structure in the continuous phase improved both the freeze-thaw and thermal stability of the obtained Pickering emulsion system. Encouragingly, the Pickering high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs, phi=0.75) stabilized by DEWN/SA3-GDL3 were prepared, which could be stored at 4°C for at least 30days without oiling-off and creaming. Conclusion. These findings not only develop a green ultra-stable Pickering emulsion system but also extend the potential commercial applications of duck egg white proteins in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	3	949	956	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11427					FSTA:2022-04-Ae7164
J		Ze Lin; Zheng-yun Wu; Wen-xue Zhang							Bioinformatics analysis of amino acid decarboxylases related to four major biogenic amines in pickles.		Food Chemistry					Microbial amino acid decarboxylases (AADs) produce biogenic amines (BAs) in fermented food. However, a systematic comparison of the AADs' properties from different microorganisms in pickle fermentation remains unexplored. Here, we bioinformatically analyzed the amino acid sequences of AADs corresponding to four major BAs for common microorganisms in pickle fermentation. We showed that their sequences, besides tyrosine decarboxylase, differed among microorganisms. Overall, the AAD sequences varied lesser among bacterial species than between bacteria and fungi, with those in Lactobacillus sharing occasionally high similarity with other bacteria. Most AADs were predicted as stable cytosolic endoenzymes. Molecular docking showed that most commonly used spice components in pickle production, especially pepper, chili, and ginger, strongly bind to the AAD active sites, thus may inhibit the enzymes and reduce the BA accumulation. This study provides insights for deeply understanding the different microbial AAD properties in pickle fermentation and reducing BAs by appropriately using spices.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Pterostilbene is a revesterol analog with a long bioavailability and having potent anti-inflammatory activity in animal studies. In this study, we tried to scrutinize the anti-arthritic effect of pterostilbene against complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis model in rats. CFA was used for induction of the RA, and rats were divided into groups depending on different doses of pterostilbene given. Hepatic, antioxidant, rheumatoid factor (RF), myeloperoxidase (MPO), inflammatory cytokines, anti-collagen (C) II-Ig, inflammatory mediators, and gut microbiota were estimated. Pterostilbene significantly (p<.001) decreased the paw swelling, arthritic score, and increased the body weight. Besides altered the antioxidant, inflammatory mediators, anti-collagen (C) II Ig, and inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, pterostilbene treatment helps to restore the ecosystem of gut microbiota in rats by reducing the relative abundance of Helicobacter, Desulfovibrio, Lachnospiraceae, and Mucispirillium. Based on the findings, we can say that pterostilbene has an anti-arthritic effect via suppressing inflammatory responses and altering intestinal bacteria. Practical applications. Arthritis is the painful disease and affected most of the people worldwide. In this experimental study, we estimated the anti-arthritic effect of pterostilbene against CFA-induced arthritis in rats. Pterostilbene noticeably suppressed the paw thickness, arthritic score, and organ index. Pterostilbene substantially altered the oxidative stress and inflammatory reaction. Pterostilbene considerably modulated the gut microbiota, suggesting the anti-arthritic effect. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	5			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14011					FSTA:2022-09-Aj15658
J		Ze Yun; Huijun Gao; Xi Chen; Xuewu Duan; Yueming Jiang							The role of hydrogen water in delaying ripening of banana fruit during postharvest storage.		Food Chemistry					Experiments were conducted to identify the role of hydrogen water (HW) in banana fruit ripening. Banana fruit soaked with 0.8 ppm HW showed longer ripening than control fruit. HW treatment significantly reduced ethylene production and respiratory rate, and inhibited the expressions of ethylene synthesis- and signaling-related genes. Similarly, HW treatment inhibited the down-regulation of chlorophylls binding proteins and delayed the increase of chromaticity a*, b* and L* in banana peel. Furthermore, HW-treated peel exhibited lower expressions of cell wall degradation-related genes and higher levels of fruit firmness, pectin, hemicellulose and lignin. In addition, HW-treated pulp exhibited higher levels of starch, lower level of total soluble solids (TSS) and lower expression of flavor-related genes. Microstructural observation further confirmed that HW treatment delayed the degradations of starch and cell walls. Those results indicated that HW treatment delayed banana ripening via the role of ethylene in relation to degreening, flavor and softening.

The differential metabolites were screened and identified with variable importance in projection (VIP) scores based on orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis models. Serum phosphatidylcholine (PC) (16:1/22:6) levels had the highest and second highest VIP scores following FO + D and FO interventions, respectively. Serum PC (16:1/22:6) levels were negatively correlated with circulating alanine transaminase (ALT) (r = -0.268, p = 0.021), triacylglycerol (TAG) (r = -0.236, p = 0.042), interleukin (IL)-1beta (r = -0.401, p< 0.001) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (r = -0.322, p = 0.005) concentrations, and were positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (r = 0.272, p = 0.019) concentrations. The present study was the first to report that serum PC (16:1/22:6) levels were highly correlated with ALT, TAG, HDL-C, IL-1beta and TNF-alpha concentrations, indicating that PC (16:1/22:6) might ameliorate lipid metabolism and inflammation in NAFLD subjects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	22	11705	11714	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02349k					FSTA:2023-03-Ng0649

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The conazole fungicide propiconazole is frequently found in vegetables although usage is not allowed. To overcome the high-cost and time-consuming labour requirements of instrumental methods, we developed a simple and visual lateral flow immunoassay for the sensitive determination of propiconazole. A hapten was carefully designed to raise a monoclonal antibody against propiconazole. Bal b/c mice were immunised with the hapten-carrier protein conjugate and a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced. Based on this mAb, a sensitive immunochromatographic strip assay (ICA) was established for rapid screening of propiconazole in vegetable samples. After optimisation of analytical parameters, the ICA strip showed a detection limit of 0.13 ng g-1 and a linear range from 0.5 to 80 ng g-1 using a strip reader. The assay also can be read by the naked eye with a visual limit of detection of 80 ng g-1. The recoveries for spiked vegetable samples by ICA ranged from 85.2% to 114.9%, with a coefficient of variation less than 11.7%. The assay time is within 45 min for a single sample including the sample pre-treatment. For spiked and blind samples, the detection capability of ICA was equivalent to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	1	92	104	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1976423					FSTA:2022-05-Jh5969

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Autophagy is a critical intracellular solute trafficking and degradation pathway associated with leaf senescence. Autophagy-related genes (ATGs), are indispensable for autophagosome formation and autophagic process, but the underlying molecular functions of ATGs during leaf senescence in harvested leafy vegetables such as Chinese flowering cabbage remain largely unknown. In this study, 53 ATG genes from Chinese flowering cabbage were identified and studied. Notably, the expression of three ATG genes, BrATG5b, BrATG8e-1 and BrATG8h-1, was strongly up-regulated during postharvest leaf senescence. These genes were induced by senescence-promoting phytohormones methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and abscisic acid (ABA), and repressed by senescence-delaying hormones cytokinin 6-benzyladenine (6-BA) and gibberellic acid (GA3). We identified a MYB transcriptional factor, BrMYB108, which showed a similar expression pattern as that of BrATG5b, BrATG8e-1 and BrATG8h-1. This was localized in the nucleus and possessed trans-activation activity. Further, DNA-protein interaction assays showed that BrMYB108 directly binds to BrATG5b, BrATG8e-1 and BrATG8h-1 promoters and enhances their expression. In summary, this study unravels a novel transcription factor that activates the expression of senescence-associated ATGs, thereby acting as a potential positive regulator of postharvest leaf senescence in Chinese flowering cabbage.

J		Zebib, H.; Abate, D.; Woldegiorgis, A. Z.							Aflatoxin M1 in raw milk, pasteurized milk and cottage cheese collected along value chain actors from three regions of Ethiopia.		Toxins					Milk is a highly nutritious and perfect natural food for humans. However, when lactating animals feed on Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-containing feed, the hydroxyl metabolite aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) contaminates the milk and dairy products. The objective of the current study was to assess the level of AFM1 in raw milk, normally pasteurized milk and Ethiopian cottage cheese collected from value chain actors (producers, collectors, processors and retailers). Cross-sectional study and simple random techniques were used to collect primary samples. A total of 160 composite samples was collected; raw milk (n = 64), pasteurized milk (n = 64) and cheese (n = 32) was analyzed. Quantitative analysis of AFM1 was conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The results indicate that AFM1 was detected in all milk products. Results along value chains show that the concentration of AFM1 in raw milk from collectors was significantly higher than from producers, and in pasteurized milk from processors and retailers (p< 0.05). However, no significant (p> 0.05) difference was observed in cottage cheese value-chain actors in all regions. Comparison of AFM1 mean values among all dairy products shows that raw milk had a significantly higher concentration of AFM1 followed by pasteurized milk and cottage cheese. However, there was no significant difference between raw and pasteurized milk (p> 0.05). The mean AFM1 contamination in milk products ranged from 0.137 to 0.319 g/L (mean value 0.285 g/L). The contamination percentages of AFM1 in raw milk (62.50%), pasteurized milk (67.20%) and cottage cheese (25%) were above the regulatory limit set by the European Union (EU) (0.05 g/L). According to USA/Ethiopian Standard (US/ES) (0.50 g/L), 21.87%, 25% and 1% exceeded the regulatory limit for the above products, respectively. The overall prevalence (56.88%) was above the EU regulatory limit and 19.38% over US/ES regulations. Therefore, to provide accurate information about the health risk to consumers, there is a need to conduct risk assessment studies in consumers of milk and dairy products at different age groups. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a relapsing and chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which seriously threatens human health. Zingerone (ZO) has been proven to be effective for many diseases. The purpose of this study is to investigate the protective effects and potential mechanisms of ZO extracted from ginger on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced mouse ulcerative colitis (UC). Results. The results showed that ZO alleviated the weight loss of UC model mice, reduced the disease activity index scores, and inhibited the shortening of colon length. ZO also improved DSS-induced pathological changes in colon tissue and inhibited the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in colon and mesenteric lymph nodes. Further mechanism analysis found that ZO inhibited DSS-induced nuclear factor-kappaB pathway activation, and regulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) expression. To further explore whether PPARgamma was involved in the anti-UC effect of ZO, PPARgamma inhibitor GW9662 was used. Although ZO also showed a protective effect on GW9662-treated colitis mice, the protective role was significantly weakened. Importantly, the administration of GW9662 significantly aggravated UC compared with the ZO + DSS group. In addition, we preliminarily found that ZO had the effects of inhibiting DSS-induced oxidative stress, maintaining intestinal barrier, and inhibiting the content of LPS and the population of Escherichia coli. Conclusions. These results indicated that supplementation with ZO might be a new dietary strategy for the treatment of UC. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4873	4882	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11850					FSTA:2022-11-Te4428
J		Zecheng Jiang; Rui Li; Yue Tang; Ziyu Cheng; Minjie Qian; Wen Li; Yuanzhi Shao							Transcriptome analysis reveals the inducing effect of Bacillus siamensis on disease resistance in postharvest mango fruit.		Foods					Postharvest anthracnose, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, is one of the most important postharvest diseases of mangoes worldwide. Bacillus siamensis (B. siamensis), as a biocontrol bacteria, has significant effects on inhibiting disease and improving the quality of fruits and vegetables. In this study, pre-storage application of B. siamensis significantly induced disease resistance and decreased disease index (DI) of stored mango fruit. To investigate the induction mechanisms of B. siamensis, comparative transcriptome analysis of mango fruit samples during the storage were established. In total, 234,808 unique transcripts were assembled and 56,704 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparative transcriptome analysis. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of DEGs showed that most of the DEGs involved in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, and biosynthesis of resistant substances were enriched. Fourteen DEGs related to disease-resistance were validated by qRT-PCR, which well corresponded to the FPKM value obtained from the transcriptome data. These results indicate that B. siamensis treatment may act to induce disease resistance of mango fruit by affecting multiple pathways. These findings not only reveal the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that govern postharvest disease, but also develop a biological strategy to maintain quality of post-harvest mango fruit. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zeeshan Habib, R.; Vijo Poulose; Rana Alsaidi; Al Kendi, R.; Haris Iftikhar, S.; Ismail Mourad, A.; Fares Kittaneh, W.; Thies Thiemann							Plastic cutting boards as a source of microplastics in meat.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Plastic cutting boards were found to be the source of polythene microplastic contamination in cut meat commercially available at butchers and a supermarket chain in the Middle East, making them also a direct source of microplastic in wastewater. The mean size of the microplastic in the raw meat was 1279.2 835.0 m, but decreased when the meat was cooked or fried. The microplastic melted during both cooking and frying processes and recrystallised partially upon cooling. Washing the meat for a short time (10 seconds) before preparing it reduced the microplastic contamination insignificantly, and only extensive washing of the meat over longer periods of time (3 min) helped decrease the microplastic count to 0.07 MP/g meat. The composition of the cutting boards was analysed by FT-IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and subjected to wear, tensile and hardness tests. From a 3D photo of a spent cutting board, it was calculated that 875 g polythene was lost from the cutting board at the end of its lifetime. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	3	609	619	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.2017002					FSTA:2022-08-Sa4075
J		Zeghbib, W.; Boudjouan, F.; Bachir-bey, M.							Optimization of phenolic compounds recovery and antioxidant activity evaluation from Opuntia ficus indica using response surface methodology.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Opuntia ficus indica (OFI) is a Cactaceae plant growing generally in arid and semi-arid regions of the world. The extraction of bioactive compounds from plants could be done by numerous methods according to the economic aspects, means, and method suitability for targeted compounds, thus, this study is aimed to optimize the extraction conditions of decoction method for phenolic compounds and antioxidant activities evaluation, using response surface methodology from edible parts of cactus fruit (seeds, pulp, and fruits). The highest results for total phenolic compounds (TPC) were 335, 568, and 524mg GAE/100g DM for seeds, pulp, and fruits, respectively. The highest ABTS radical scavenging activities were 1822, 4208, and 3174 mole TE/100g DM, while, the reducing power (RP) was 210, 201, and 239 AAE/100g DM for seeds, pulp, and fruit, respectively. The statistical analysis showed a significant effect of the studied parameters on extraction from all samples, except for the time that was insignificant for TPC and RP of pulp. The Response surface analysis showed that the optimal extraction parameters were 90°C, 1g/100mL, and 30min for temperature, sample/solvent ratio, and time, respectively (except fruits, demonstrating a ratio of 1.8g/100mL). In conclusion, the decoction seemed to be a good extraction method for antioxidant compounds from OFI. In addition, these latter compounds were found to be heat stable and contribute significantly to the antioxidant activity of the fruit. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Zehang Guo; Hongxin Zhang; Kewei Chen; Zhirong Wang; Guangjing Chen; Bing Yang; Jianquan Kan							Characterization of sonicated gluten protein and subsequent rheological properties of model dough and noodles.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the thermo-mechanical and rheological properties of a wheat gluten-sonicated model dough and noodles, as well as the effects of ultrasonic frequency (20, 28, 40, 68 and 80kHz) on the functional properties and structural features of gluten. Results. Water absorption, stability and developmental time, and viscoelastic behavior of gluten-sonicated model dough were all found to be improved. Water absorption, tensile resistance and stretching distance of noodles increased markedly, whereas cooking loss decreased. Ultrasonication at different frequencies also significantly affected gluten structure, including its surface hydrophobicity, micro-network structure, and secondary and tertiary structures. These alterations then caused changes in its functional characteristics. Compared to untreated gluten, sonicated gluten exhibited significantly increased oil and water capacities (8.75-15.26% and 100.65-127.71% higher than the untreated gluten, respectively), foaming and emulsifying properties, and increased solubility (63.46-98.83% higher than control). In addition, these findings indicated that 40kHz was the likely resonance frequency of the cavitation bubble in the gluten solution. However, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis electropherograms revealed that such treatments did not affect the molecular weight of gluten, which was also consistent with its unchanged disulfide bond content. Conclusion. The present study clarified the impact of frequency on the properties of gluten and model dough. The best frequency for modification of gluten was 40kHz. Collectively, these findings suggest that ultrasonic technology has the potential for use in modifying wheat gluten and commercial noodle processing. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	103	2	799	810	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12191					FSTA:2023-03-Mq2316
J		Zehang Guo; Xingzhou Li; Daichenling Yang; Ailing Lei; Fusheng Zhang							Structural and functional properties of chestnut starch based on high-pressure homogenization.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effect of high-pressure homogenization (HPH) with different pressures, cycles, and starch concentrations on the functional and structural characteristics of chestnut starch. Results showed that the structures of the subcrystalline zone and amorphous region could be destroyed by increasing the pressure for 1 cycle, leading to improved functional properties. Compared with the untreated, the solubility and swelling power of chestnut starch were significantly enhanced by approximately 53.01-86.02% and 64.54-79.50%, the aging value was 48.62-99.00% lower than the original starch, and the transparency increased by 8.55-25.51%. Furthermore, as the cycles increased, the crystal zone structure of starch was damaged. The crystallinity significantly decreased by 28.66-45.60%, compared with the original starch, with particle distribution tending to be uneven and the average particle size decreased by 17.50-90.02%. Besides, solubility, swelling power and transparency could be improved by increasing concentration during HPH.

J		Zehong Chen; Yuxuan Liu; Dan Wang; Niuniu Wu; Kaiping Wang; Yu Zhang							Preparation, chemical structure and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of sulfated polysaccharide from Grifola frondosa.		Journal of Functional Foods					Sufalted modification of Grifola frondosa polysaccharide (GFP) was performed using the chlorosulfonic acid-pyridine (CSA-Pyr) method. The chemical structure and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of sulfated Grifola frondosa polysaccharide (S-GFP) were investigated. FT-IR and NMR spectra both revealed C-6 as the main substituted position owing to steric hindrance. Molecular weight (Mw) analysis indicated that sulfation and degradation could exist concurrently during the sulfation reaction given that the Mw of S-GFP was different from that of natural GFP. Inhibition test of alpha-glucosidase activity implied that S-GFP is a noncompetitive inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase. S-GFP effectively inhibited the activity of alpha-glucosidase with an IC50 value of 3.353 g mL-1. The results of inhibitory mechanism indicated that S-GFP quenched the endogenous fluorescence of alpha-glucosidase and changed the backbone structure of the protein. Circular dichroism (CD) analysis showed that treatment with S-GFP changed the conformation of alpha-glucosidase, increased the content of the alpha-helix structure, and destroyed the hydrogen bond system of the enzyme. This experiment aims to elucidate the potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity of sulfated polysaccharides and to provide new insights into the targets of their bioactivities.

J		Zehra Gunel; Aysegul Parlak; Mehmet Adsoy; Ayhan Topuz							Physicochemical properties and storage stability of Turkish coffee fortified with apricot kernel powder.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Apricot kernel (AK) is a by-product of dried apricot rich in oils, proteins, carbohydrates, and minerals. However, despite its rich content, it is generally discarded after apricot processing. This study aims to expand the usage areas of AK with rich content and offer new alternatives to coffee consumers. Various concentrations of powdered AK were added in Turkish coffee (mixture: AKTC) to improve product flavor and increase nutritional and functional properties. After cooking, some physicochemical analysis and storage stability of AKTC were evaluated. With the addition of AK, the phenolic content of TC increased approximately two times. Also, the addition of AK increased the antioxidant activity of TC by about 15%. Acrylamide content of TC was decreased from 131.36 3.13mug/kg to 82.55 2.13mug/kg by adding more AK. Panelists gave higher scores to AKTC compared to TC. According to the storage stability analyses, adding AK increased the storage stability of the pure Turkish coffee. Novelty impact statement. The dried apricot by-product was first used for the fortifying of Turkish coffee, and the usage area of the apricot kernel, a high value-added waste, was expanded. The acrylamide level of the Turkish coffee was reduced by adding apricot kernel powder.

J		Zehu Yuan; Ling Ge; Weibo Zhang; Xiaoyang Lv; Shanhe Wang; Xiukai Cao; Wei Sun							Preliminary results about lamb meat tenderness based on the study of novel isoforms and alternative splicing regulation pathways using Iso-seq, RNA-seq and CTCF ChIP-seq data.		Foods					Tenderness is an important indicator of meat quality. Novel isoforms associated with meat tenderness and the role of the CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) in regulating alternative splicing to produce isoforms in sheep are largely unknown. The current project studied six sheep from two crossbred populations (Dorper * Hu * Hu, DHH and Dorper * Dorper * Hu, DDH) with divergent meat tenderness. Pooled Iso-seq data were used to annotate the sheep genomes. Then, the updated genome annotation and six RNA-seq data were combined to identify differentially expressed isoforms (DEIs) in muscles between DHH and DDH. These data were also combined with peaks detected from CTCF ChIP-seq data to investigate the regulatory role of CTCF for the alternative splicing. As a result, a total of 624 DEIs were identified between DDH and DHH. For example, isoform 7.524.18 transcribed from CAPN3 may be associated with meat tenderness. In addition, a total of 86 genes were overlapped between genes with transcribed DEIs and genes in differential peaks identified by CTCF ChIP-seq. Among these overlapped genes, ANKRD23 produces different isoforms which may be regulated by CTCF via methylation. As preliminary research, our results identified novel isoforms associated with meat tenderness and revealed the possible regulating mechanisms of alternative splicing to produce isoforms. © 2022 by the authors.

Foods					Date seeds are a major waste product that can be utilised as a valuable and nutritional material in the food industry. The aim of the present study was to improve cookies quality in terms of functional and textural value and assess the effect of date seed powder flour substitution on the physical and chemical characteristics of cookies. Three substitution levels (2.5, 5 and 7.5%) of flour by fine date seed powder from six varieties locally named Khalas, Khinaizi, Sukkary, Shaham, Zahidi and Fardh were prepared. Two types of flour were used (white flour and whole wheat) at two different baking temperatures: 180 and 200°C. The incorporation of date seed had no or slight effect on moisture, ash, fat and protein content of the baked cookies. On the other hand, incorporation significantly affected the lightness and hardness of cookies; the higher level of addition, the darker and crispier the resulting cookies. The sensory analysis indicated that the produced cookies were acceptable in terms of smell, taste, texture and overall acceptability. The results indicate that the most acceptable cookies across all evaluated parameters were produced using whole wheat flour with 7.5% levels of date seed powder using Khalas and Zahidi varieties. Overall, the analysis indicated that cookies with acceptable physical characteristics and an improved nutritional profile could be produced with partial replacement of the white/whole wheat flour by date seed powder. © 2022 by the authors.

Foods					Utilising major waste products from the food industry can have both a great environmental impact and be a means to improve consumer health. Date seed is a food industry byproduct that has been proven to have high nutritional value. The aim of this work was to measure the total polyphenolic content (TPC), flavonoids, and antioxidant activity of the seeds of six date fruit varieties, Fard, Khalas, Khinaizi, Sukkary, Shaham, and Zahidi, and to use those seeds to enhance the antioxidant value of cookies by partially substituting flour with ground date seed. Date seed powder (DSP) was extracted at three levels of sample to solvent ratio (5:1, 10:1 and 15:1 mg/mL). Cookies were prepared using three substitution levels of wheat flour (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5%, w/w) by DSP and two types of flour (white and whole wheat), and were baked at two different temperatures, 180 and 200 °C. The composite cookies were found to contain a significant amount of TPC and flavonoids, and showed increased antioxidant activity compared with the control samples. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zeinab Mashhadi; Ali Khadivi							Identification of superior late-blooming apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) genotypes among seedling-originated trees.		Food Science & Nutrition					One of the major limiting factors in the intensive spread of apricot (Prunus armeniaca L.) in most of the countries is spring frost. Thus, the breeding efforts have concentrated on the use of late-blooming genotypes as a means of frost avoidance. The aim of the present study was to identify late-blooming genotypes with high fruit quality among seedling-originated trees. Firstly, pre-selections were done according to blooming time within 278 apricot seedling-originated trees. Secondly, the late-blooming selections were further evaluated according to their vegetative and fruit characteristics to determine superior types. Significant differences were observed among the late-blooming genotypes in terms of the traits recorded. Fruit ground color was strongly variable, including white, yellow, yellow-green, light orange, orange, and dark orange. Fruit weight ranged from 27.37 to 33.99g, fruit flesh thickness varied from 11.16 to 13.47mm, and total soluble solids varied between 17.00% and 23.87%. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) performed with Euclidean distance and Ward's method divided the genotypes into two main clusters based on morphological traits and in some cases, the genotypes belonging to an area were clustered into different clusters. All the 48 late-blooming date genotypes selected could be useful as a parent to improve flowering season of cultivars. Also, among them, 10genotypes were superior in terms of fruit quality-related characters, such as fruit weight, fruit color, fruit taste, and TSS, and thus they can be singled out for cultivation. © 2022 The Authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Probiotics are useful microorganisms with health effects. Although the probiotic industry has grown dramatically over the past decade, their survival is still challenging. Also, the residual of antibiotics is considered a serious problem with major health and technological problems in the fermented food industry. In this study, the biofilm technique was examined as a practical solution for increasing viability. The biofilm of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus plantarum are formed in the culture medium (using microtiter plate biofilm method) and yogurt (in containers). The antibiotic susceptibility of probiotics to enrofloxacin, sulfadimidine, tetracycline, and oxytetracycline were studied. The results showed that enrofloxacin, the strongest antibiotic, reduces the bacterial population in the biofilm form only 2.6 log. In contrast, the population of bacteria reduced by about 8 log in plankton form. Therefore, biofilm techniques can be introduced as a survival strategy for the food and pharmaceutical industry. Practical applications. As a new and innovative approach, the biofilm method can lead to a new generation of probiotics, which can significantly protect probiotics against environmental stress and antibiotic residues and significantly affect their survival. The formation of biofilm by probiotics is a unique feature that is inherently bacterial and is a natural and low-cost method that can upgrade the long-term sustainability of probiotics. Therefore, biofilm can be commercially used to create new capacity in food and related industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15991					FSTA:2023-01-Pl0215

Journal of Food Process Engineering					Orange is a perishable fruit that is dried to increase its shelf-life. The main challenge of industrial dryers is their high energy consumption, which accounts for about 12% to 20% of the energy demands of the industry. In the present study, a continuous water bed-infrared dryer equipped with a photovoltaic-thermal (PV-T) collector was presented for orange fruit drying. The designed dryer comprised two main units: the PV-T air collector and the water bed-infrared dryer. The PV-T collector was considered to simultaneously generate electricity and heat required for the hot airflow inside the dryer. The effects of the hot water flow rate (0.05, 0.1, and 0.15L/min) and the product thickness (3, 5, and 7mm) on solar heat fraction, final moisture content of the dried oranges, and energy and exergy efficiencies of the dryer were investigated using the factorial test based on a randomized complete block design experiment. The average solar heat fraction increased by 35.1% with increasing the thickness from 3 to 7mm, and increased by 29.8% with increasing the water flow rate from 0.05 to 0.15L/min. Rising the water flow rate in the studied range reduced the final moisture content by about 14.7%. The average solar heat fraction, final moisture content as well as energy and exergy efficiencies of the dryer were obtained 0.26-0.61, 9.1%-16.04% wet basis (wb), 26.35%-35.63%, and 3.42%-12.9%, respectively. The best operating condition suggested based on the highest solar heat fraction, energy and exergy efficiencies, and the lowest final moisture content, was the 3-mm slice thickness of orange and the water flow rate of 0.15L/min. Practical Applications. The main challenge of industrial dryers is their high energy consumption. In the present study, to increase energy efficiency in water bed dryers, a heat source of infrared radiation was deployed on top of the product surface, and a PV-T collector was used to generate electricity and hot airflow simultaneously. We experimentally investigated the changes in heat fraction of solar energy, final moisture content of dried oranges, and energy and exergy efficiencies of the designed continuous water bed-infrared dryer equipped with PV-T collector at different operating conditions. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	8			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.14058					FSTA:2022-11-Jc15804
J		Zeinab Sadeghinejad; Javad Erfani-Moghadam; Ali Khadivi							Bioactive content and phenolic compounds of common medlar (Mespilus germanica L.) and Stern's medlar (M. canescens Phipps).		Food Science & Nutrition					Medlar (Mespilus) is an important fruit and is rich in nutritional and medical properties. Bioactive content and phenolic compounds of leaf, fruit, and seed samples of common medlar (M. germanica) and Stern's medlar (M. canescens) were studied. The coefficient of variation showed high values among all the characters and was more than 50.00%, ranging from 59.74 to 196.81%. The leaf of M. canescens showed the highest total phenolic content (14.73mg/g dry weight, DW) and followed by 13.70mg/g DW in the seed of M. germanica collected from Ilam province, Iran. The highest flavonoid content was observed in fruits of M. germanica collected from the north of Iran (0.90mg/g DW), and followed by the leaf of M. canescens (0.53mg/g DW). The phenolic compounds showed strong variation. Principal component analysis showed that four PCs explained 95.07% of the observed total variance. Ward dendrogram indicated two different clusters based on the characters measured, indicating high variation among the accessions. The current investigation clearly showed the potential value of the common medlar (M. germanica) and Stern's medlar (M. canescens) germplasm, as different medlar organs are significant sources of phenolic compounds and high antioxidant activity. Therefore, these species can be considered suitable sources of natural antioxidants, and may show potential future use in food and nutraceutical supplement formulations. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zeinab Teymori; Marzieh Sadeghi; Nazir Fattahi							Countercurrent salting-out homogenous liquid-liquid extraction and dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on the solidification of floating organic drop followed by high-performance liquid chromatography for the isolation and preconcentration of pesticides from fruit samples.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Pesticides are widely used to control pests and prevent diseases in crops, including cereals, vegetables, and fruits. Due to factors such as the persistence of pesticides, bioaccumulation, and potential toxicity, pesticide residue monitoring in foodstuffs is very important. Objective. In the current research, we proposed a novel approach using countercurrent salting-out homogenous liquid-liquid extraction combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on the solidification of floating organic droplets (DLLME-SFO) for isolation and preconcentration of pesticides from aqueous samples for analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). Methods. In brief, sodium chloride was used as a separation reagent, in a small glass column, through which was passed a mixture of an aqueous solution of, for example, fruit juice and acetonitrile. In this process, the droplets rose through the column and a separated layer would be formed on the remained an aqueous phase. Following that, acetonitrile as the organic phase was mixed with 50.0 L of 1-undecanol (extraction solvent). To further enrich the analytes, the mixture was injected into 5mL of a 4% w/v sodium chloride solution and placed in a tube for the DLLME-SFO. Results. Under optimal conditions, a dynamic linear range of 0.5-500 mug/L, extraction recovery of 65-85%, enrichment factors of 108-142, and limit of detection of 0.2-0.4 mug/L were obtained for the organophosphorus pesticides analysed. In addition, the repeatability and reproducibility from five replicate measurements of the pesticides (100 mug/L) were within the ranges of 3.5-5.1% and 4.5-6.3%, respectively. Conclusion. In this research, a new extraction method based on countercurrent salting out homogeneous liquid-liquid extraction combined with DLLME-SFO has been applied for the determination of pesticide residues in fruits, juice and environmental samples before using HPLC-UV analysis. The combined method not only leads to high enrichment factors, but can also be used in complex matrices (such as fruits, juices and high-salt solutions) without pre-treatment or dilution. Compared with other sample preparation methods, this analysis procedure has many advantages, including simplicity, ease of operation, high pre-enrichment factor, low detection limit and relatively short analysis time. Highlights. Combination of CCSHLLE and DLLME-SFO was applied for the analysis of organophosphorous pesticide residues in fruit, fruit juices and environmental samples. The DLLME-SFO method avoided using high density and toxic extraction solvents. LODs are achievable at ng L-1 using CCSLLE-DLLME-SFO-HPLC-UV. © The Author(s) 2021.

J		Zeinali, S.; Wieczorek, M. N.; Pawliszyn, J.							Free versus droplet-bound aroma compounds in sparkling beverages.		Food Chemistry					The initial experience of a beverage's flavor after opening the bottle is created by a combination of the gas phase and droplet-bound odorants. However, most studies do not consider this combination, and focus on the odor-active components in the liquid or gas phase, separately. To cover this aspect, a filter from pyrolyzed polyacrylonitrile fiber was packed inside thermal desorption unit liner and used for trapping droplet-bound odorants. Additionally, polydimethylsiloxane coated thin-film was applied for extraction of gas-phase aroma. Following trapping/extraction, the devices were desorbed and compounds were separated using GC-MS. The odorants in commercial sparkling beverages were quantified immediately after opening the bottle to mimic real-life conditions of the consumer's experience of the flavor. The reported results provide a more comprehensive understanding of flavor perception in effervescent drinks by considering both gas and droplet phase. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Zejia Lin; Tong Chen; Lehao Zhou; Hongshun Yang							Effect of chlorine sanitizer on metabolic responses of Escherichia coli biofilms "big six" during cross-contamination from abiotic surface to sponge cake.		Food Research International					The effect of chlorine on Escherichia coli biofilm O157:H7 are well established; however, the effect on biofilm adhesion to food as well as the six emerging E. coli serotypes ("big six") have not been fully understood. Chlorine sanitization with 1-min 100mg/L was applied against seven pathogenic E. coli (O111, O121:H19, O45:H2, O26:H11, O103:H11, O145, and O157:H7) biofilms on high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and stainless steel (SS) coupons, respectively. Using sponge cake as a food model, the adhesion behavior was evaluated by comparison of bacteria transfer rate before and after treatment. Besides, the metabolic profiles of biofilms were analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. A significant decrease in transfer rate (79% decline on SS and 33% decline on HDPE) was recorded as well as the distinctive pattern between SS and HDPE coupons was also noticed, with a low population (6-7 log CFU/coupon) attached and low survivals (0-3 log CFU/coupon) upon chlorine on SS, while high population (7-8 log CFU/coupon) attached and high survivals (5-7 log CFU/coupon) on HDPE. Moreover, O121:H19 and O26:H11 demonstrated the highest resistance to chlorine with the least metabolic status and pathways affected. O103:H11, O145, and O111 followed similar metabolic patterns on both surfaces. Distinct metabolic patterns were found in O45:H2 and O157:H7, where the former had more affected metabolic status and pathways on SS but less on HDPE, whereas the latter showed an opposite trend. Overall, a potential contamination source of STEC infection in flour products was demonstrated and metabolic changes induced by chlorine were revealed by NMR-based metabolomics, which provides insights to avoid "big six" biofilms contamination in food.

J		Zejun Hu; Peng Wu; Luping Wang; Zongyu Wu; Xiao Dong Chen							Exploring in vitro release and digestion of commercial DHA microcapsules from algae oil and tuna oil with whey protein and casein as wall materials.		Food & Function					Microencapsulation is a promising technique to improve the bioavailability and mask the unpleasant smell of DHA oils. Yet, how the encapsulated DHA oils are "released" and "digested" within the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the effect of the wall material and source of DHA have been largely unknown. Here, two commercial DHA microcapsules from algae oil (A-DHA) and tuna oil (T-DHA) with 100% whey protein (WP) and 80% casein and 20% WP (C-WP) as wall materials were evaluated in vitro respectively. The release ratio was nearly linearly increased to 77.7% and 41.7% after the simulated gastric phase for T-DHA and A-DHA microcapsules, respectively. In contrast to A-DHA microcapsules for which the release of DHA approached equilibrium in the later intestinal phase, a decline in the release ratio was shown for T-DHA microcapsules perhaps due to the interaction of T-DHA with bile salts resulting in the formation of micelles. The more stable release behaviors might suggest a better performance of A-DHA coated by WP, which enables sustainable release during GIT digestion. This is supported by the better ability to resist gastric proteolysis for A-DHA microcapsules. Additionally, T-DHA (27.5%) showed a lower lipid digestibility than A-DHA (68.5%) in the end due to their structure difference. Significantly positive correlations were found for both microcapsules between DHA release ratio and protein hydrolysis. This study has provided quantitative information on the in vitro release and digestion of DHA microcapsules as influenced by the wall protein and DHA source. The findings are practically meaningful for future formulation of DHA microcapsules with controlled release rates at target sites of the GIT. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	2	978	989	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02993b					FSTA:2022-05-Nh1037

Food & Function					Coffee peel (CP) contains abundant phytochemicals which might prevent non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study aimed to identify the main phytochemicals in CP extracts, and to investigate whether CP extracts could ameliorate NAFLD through a hepatic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 21-adiponectin signaling pathway. Caffeine and seven monomers of flavonoids were identified from CP extracts by using high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). After 8 weeks of intervention, the mice fed a high-fat and high-sugar diet showed the pathophysiological characteristics of NAFLD. Treatment with CP extracts significantly alleviated hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance and reduced the concentrations of serum alanine transaminase, FGF21, and triglyceride, and hepatic interleukin-6, interleukin-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while increasing serum adiponectin concentrations. Meanwhile, CP extract supplementation significantly decreased the gene and protein expression levels of FGF21, while enhancing adiponectin expression levels. The present study demonstrated that CP extracts contained caffeine and seven monomers of flavonoids, and protected against NAFLD through regulating the FGF21-adiponectin signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	13	7251	7259	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00081d					FSTA:2022-11-Hn9883

Food & Function					Capsaicin (Cap) is a promising bioactive compound having many health-promoting benefits. However, it is difficult to be applied in food due to its poor aqueous solubility, low stability and bioavailability. Besides, its strong spicy taste and irritation to the gastrointestinal tract further limit the application of Cap in food. To solve this problem, Cap was loaded into a self-assembled nanocarrier formed by partial hydrolysis of alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-lac). The Cap was successfully loaded into the 21.2 nm micelles with a loading capacity of 123.4 6.1mg g-1. The aqueous solubility was greatly improved. Besides, nanomicelles also showed intestinal responsive release behavior. The in vivo bioavailability of Cap was improved by nanomicelles for 3.1 times. The Cap loaded nanomicelles in the milk system showed good colloidal stability compared to solely Cap in milk. Therefore, the Cap loaded nanocarriers were added into the de-fatted milk to prepare de-fatted cheese with an acceptable spicy flavor. The nanocarriers were clearly captured in the cheese casein network as confirmed by confocal microscopy. The sensory evaluation results showed the spicy taste of capsaicin was reduced in the nanomicelle system and further reduced in the nanomicelle-cheese systems. We postulated that it might be due to the nanomicelles reducing the contact of capsaicin with sensory neurons in the tongue thus masking the spicy taste. The cheese casein network structure further masked their contact. The above results indicated that Cap embedding via alpha-lac nanocarriers was feasible for masking their spicy taste and applying Cap to food systems such as milk and cheese. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	23	12258	12267	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01073a					FSTA:2023-03-Pj1526

Removal of starch granule associated proteins affects annealing of normal and waxy maize starches.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of starch granule associated proteins (SGAPs) removal on the annealing of waxy and normal maize starch were investigated. Annealing significantly decreased the crystallinity, pasting viscosity, gelatinization temperature range, pseudoplasticity, and thixotropy of waxy and normal maize starches. Annealing little affected digestibility of the starches. Removal of SGAPs reduced the stability of starch granules, but significantly increased pasting viscosity, pseudoplasticity and thixotropy. Both annealing and SGAPs removal decreased the G′ and G of normal maize starch in dynamic rheological testing, but had little effect on waxy maize starch. Removal of SGAPs increased rapidly digestible starch (RDS) but reduced resistant starch (RS) for in vitro digestibility. SGAPs removal changed the effect of annealing on starches, and annealing showed different effect on waxy and normal maize starch with SGAPs removal. Annealing increased gelatinization enthalpy and RS of both normal and waxy maize starches after SGAPs removal, and decreased their pasting viscosities and RDS. The rheological properties of starches with SGAPs removal prior to annealing were impacted by amylose content. Annealing decreased pseudoplastic and thixotropy of waxy maize starch with SGAPs removal while increasing dynamic rheological properties of normal maize starch with SGAPs removal.

Investigation on Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and coliforms in beef from Ethiopian abattoirs: a potential risk of meat safety.		Food Science & Nutrition					The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of Salmonella enterica (S. enterica) antimicrobial resistance based upon phenotypic assessment, and level of sanitation indicator organisms from 150 beef carcasses collected from three representative abattoirs in eastern, central, and southern Ethiopia. Samples were screened for S. enterica prevalence following the U.S. Department of Agriculture Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook (MLG) and confirmed by real-time PCR. The S. enterica isolates were phenotypically evaluated for susceptibility to a panel of 13 antimicrobials using disk diffusion method as described in Clinical and Laboratory Standard Institutes guidelines. In addition, the coliform, total coliform, and generic E. coli populations were quantified by plating onto E. coli/coliform petrifilms. A total of 45 isolates of S. enterica were confirmed using real-time PCR. The overall prevalence of S. enterica at the carcass level was 22.7% (95% CI, 16.0-30.0). However, based on the sampling points , S. enterica prevalence detected on hides was 13.3% (95% CI, 8.0-18.7), pre-evisceration was 12.0% (95% CI, 7.3-17.3), and post-evisceration was 4.7% (95% CI, 1.3-8.0). The prevalence of S. enterica was significantly lower on post-evisceration as compared to hides (p = .009) and pre-evisceration (p = .022). No differences were detected for the prevalence of S. enterica between abattoirs (p = .346). Finally, the prevalence of S. enterica was highest during the wet season (p = .011). The overall mean log CFU/cm2 SD of generic E. coli, coliform, and total coliform counts were 4.55 0.99,4.91 1.13, and 4.98 1.09, respectively. About 20% of S. enterica exhibited phenotypic multidrug resistant. The most frequently detected resistance was to Tetracycline (28.9%), followed by Streptomycin (22.2%) and Sulfisoxazole (20.0%). The data from this study highlight the need to implement interventions on improvement of sanitary practices in abattoirs. © 2022 The Authors.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Controlled-release urea (CRU) or fulvic acid (FA), when applied, have been shown to increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) or to stimulate plant growth, yet their interactive effects are not well explored. The objective of this study was to investigate the synergistic mechanisms of CRU combined with FA (CRU + FA) on maize (Zea mays L.) growth. Through the experimental design with five treatments, the N metabolism through the transcriptomic analysis of maize leaf, endogenous hormones, photosynthesis enzymes in maize leaf and root, and maize yield and NUE were evaluated. Results. Compared with CRU treatment, CRU + FA treatment significantly increased auxin, nitrate reductase, and glutamate dehydrogenase in leaf by 35.4%, 43.9%, 40.8% and 19.5%, respectively, as well as, the relative content of the leaf chlorophyll and photosynthetic rate by 14.8% and 45.6%, respectively, at 12-leaf collar stage; the carbon/nitrogen (C/N) metabolic process was significantly enriched in CRU + FA treatment by 312 and 418genes, according to transcriptome profiles of C/N metabolic in leaves from various fertilizer treated maize; maize yield and NUE of CRU + FA treatment were increased by 6.3% and 38.4%, respectively. Conclusions. These results demonstrated that CRU + FA is a viable fertilization scheme that can enhance maize growth, yield and NUE through their synergies in improving N uptake, promoting photosynthesis, increasing C/N metabolic processes, and enhancing enzyme activities. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	9	3644	3654	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11711					FSTA:2022-10-Mc5915

Foods					Rapeseed is the third largest oil crop in the world and the largest oil crop in China. The multi-functional development and utilization of rapeseed is an effective measure for the high-quality development of rapeseed industry in China. In this study, several basic nutrients of eight rapeseed sprouts and five bean sprouts (3-5 varieties each) were determined, including sugar, crude protein, crude fiber, vitamin E, minerals, fatty acids, amino acids, and glucosinolates. Data analysis revealed that compared with bean sprouts, rapeseed sprouts were nutritionally balanced and were richer in active nutrients such as glucose, magnesium, selenium, vitamin E, and glucosinolate. Moreover, rapeseed sprouts exhibited reasonable amino acid composition and abundant unsaturated fatty acids (accounting for 90.32% of the total fatty acids). All these results indicated the potential of rapeseed sprout as a functional vegetable. Subsequently, three dominant nutrients including vitamin E, glucosinolate, and selenium were investigated in seeds and sprouts of 44 B. napus L. varieties. The results showed that germination raised the ratio of alpha-tocopherol/gamma-tocopherol from 0.53 in seeds to 9.65 in sprouts, greatly increasing the content of alpha-tocopherol with the strongest antioxidant activity among the eight isomers of vitamin E. Furthermore, germination promoted the conversion and accumulation of glucosinolate components, especially, glucoraphanin with strong anti-cancer activity with its proportion increased from 1.06% in seeds to 1.62% in sprouts. In addition, the contents of selenium, vitamin E, and glucosinolate in rapeseed sprouts were highly correlated with those in seeds. Furthermore, these three dominant nutrients varied greatly within B. napus varieties, indicating the great potential of rapeseed sprouts to be further bio-enhanced. Our findings provide reference for the multi-purpose development and utilization of rapeseed, lay a theoretical foundation for the development of rapeseed sprout into a functional vegetable, and provide a novel breeding direction. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zelin Zhou; Langrish, T.							Color formation and Maillard reactions during the spray drying process of skim milk and model systems.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The thermal degradation of fresh skim milk, reconstituted skim milk and two model systems with different lactose/WPI ratios in a new design of spray dryer has been investigated. The extent of thermal degradation has been measured by the formation of Advanced Maillard reaction products, as assessed by a fluorometric method. Significant changes have been found when the inlet temperature increased from 180 °C to 190 °C, suggesting that temperature may play an important role in the kinetics of milk degradation in spray dryers. The non-uniform distribution of particle residence time in the pilot-scale dryer suggested that the design and operation of the spray dryer used for drying may also affect the extent of thermally induced reactions during the spray-drying process. Results. From the spray drying of model systems with different lactose/WPI ratios suggested that WPI concentration may be the rate-limiting factor. Colourimetric analysis of the samples suggested a strong correlation between the formation of advanced Maillard reaction products and the color intensities of the spray-dried products. Practical Applications. A correlation exists between the color intensity of the spray-dried products and formation of advanced Maillard reaction products, which can be potentially further developed as a rapid, cost-effective quality evaluation method for spray-dried products. The discussion of the effect of spray drying conditions on the wall-deposition and re-entrainment process and thus the particle residence time distribution may also assist in improving the spray-drying process for thermally sensitive products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13936					FSTA:2022-04-Pe1877

Food Chemistry					This work presents a pipeline for optimizing semi-hydroponic growth conditions and analyzes the impact on the growth and metabolism in three Mentha species (M. arvensis, M.*piperita, or M. spicata) and three Ocimum basilicum genotypes (Chladek cervena, Litra, or Manes). The plant growth and the content-of nitrogen-containing compounds, phenolics, and terpenoids were determined under different nitrate concentrations and salt stress. Different responses were observed among genotypes for both species. Chladek cervena had the best growth under low nitrate, with lower histamine and higher flavonoid levels. Mentha*piperita was the best mint species performing under low nitrate and salt stress. Altogether, we demonstrate that a combination of phenomics and metabolomics is ideal to identify the optimal growth conditions for these plants and the chemical markers associated with these conditions. Besides, we showed that both primary and secondary metabolites can be good markers for classifying both species. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Zelong Liu; Zhenyu Cao; Jing Wang; Baoguo Sun							Chlorine dioxide fumigation: an effective technology with industrial application potential for lowering aflatoxin content in peanuts and peanut products.		Food Control					This study aimed to investigate the influence of gaseous or aqueous chlorine dioxide (ClO2, 0.025%-90% relative to dry matter) on the detoxification and physicochemical properties of aflatoxin (AF)-contaminated peanuts and their derivative products (13-204 mug AFB1/kg sample). Chlorine dioxide fumigation lowered AF levels in peanuts by >72% even to an undetectable level. The detoxification effects remained relatively stable in subsequent storage. AFB1 or total AFs in oil and meal obtained after pressing was effectively decreased by fumigating whole peanut kernels. Moreover, the iodine value, acid value, and fatty acid composition of the crude oil from fumigated peanuts did not change significantly except that a higher level of hydroperoxides was observed. In addition, fumigation induced increased moisture content in peanuts and oil yield, and after aqueous ClO2 treatment at lower fumigant dose, a post-heating treatment caused an increase of AFB1 level. The findings suggest that ClO2 fumigation is a potential detoxification method for oilseed storage or oil processing industry.

J		Zelong Liu; Zhenyu Cao; Mengmeng Zhao; Huijuan Zhang; Jing Wang; Baoguo Sun							Synergistic influence of protein particles and low-molecular-weight emulsifiers on the stability of a milk fat-based whippable oil-in-water emulsion.		Food Hydrocolloids					Oil-in-water emulsions consisting of milk fat and water were prepared with low-molecular-weight emulsifiers (LMWEs) and zein colloidal particles (ZCPs). Analysis of the creaming stability and particle size distribution showed that ZCPs caused notable droplet flocculation but no coalescence, and stabilized the emulsion against oiling-off under centrifugation. ZCPs minimized the volume loss from overrun of the whipped cream during whipping, and improved the short-term shape retention of LMWE-stabilized whipped cream. The yield stress and viscosity results further corroborated the role of ZCPs-induced flocs in the reinforced foam structure. However, in the presence of xanthan gum, the ZCP-induced droplet interaction was diminished, while creaming of the centrifuged ZCP-containing emulsion was prevented and the foam stability of the corresponding whipped sample was slightly increased. Furthermore, an interaction mode between the oil droplets with possible dual composite interfacial layers assembled by LMWEs and ZCPs in the absence or presence of xanthan was proposed.

In a previous study, we established three coculture systems of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HD1.7 with Bacillus spp. Optimization of the inoculation conditions effectively increased the Paracin 1.7 titer. This study focused on the effects of the carbon source type (TCS) and carbon source concentration (CSC) on fermentation characteristics and bacteriocin titers. The results showed that the optimal TCS for bacteriocin production by different strain combinations is strain-specific. Adjusting the CS resulted in a higher Paracin 1.7 titer with less CS consumption. The B. subtilis group saved substrate consumption while yielding more Paracin 1.7 when 1T Glc was used as the CS. The optimal CS for the B. licheniformis group was 2T Fru. The B. pumilus group had the highest titer at 1T Fru. Gene expression analysis revealed that the appropriate TCS upregulated the relative expression levels of transmembrane protein genes (ptsG, fruA) and population sensing-related genes (prcK, prcR, and luxS), facilitating nutrient transport and information exchange. Structural equation modeling confirmed that controlling the CS can influence microbial growth and thus CS consumption, ultimately obtaining a satisfactory bacteriocin titer.

Food & Function					The seedlings of purple leafed rice (SPLR) are characterized by high contents of anthocyanins and various polyphenols, whose total anthocyanin content can reach 15.16mg g-1, indicating that SPLR may have many bioactivities. Therefore, in order to evaluate the anti-obesity potential value of SPLR, the nutrient components were first identified, and the anti-obesity effect of SPLR was evaluated with a high-fat diet (HFD) induced obese mouse model for 12 weeks. The results demonstrated that SPLR supplementation could alleviate HFD-induced obesity and suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine production and macrophage infiltration in epididymal white adipose tissue of HFD-induced obese mice. The findings indicated that supplementation with SPLR may contribute to preventing obesity and related complications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	23	12426	12435	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02374a					FSTA:2023-03-Me2200

The impact of pasture and non-pasture diets on the sensory and volatile properties of whole milk powder.		Journal of Dairy Research					This study evaluated the impact of three distinct diets; perennial ryegrass (GRS), perennial ryegrass/white clover (CLV) and total mixed ration (TMR), on the sensory properties and volatile profile of whole milk powder (WMP). The samples were evaluated using a hedonic sensory acceptance test (n = 99 consumers) and by optimised descriptive profiling (ODP) using trained assessors (n = 33). Volatile profiling was achieved by gas chromatography mass spectrometry using three different extraction techniques; headspace solid phase micro-extraction, thermal desorption and high capacity sorptive extraction. Significant differences were evident in both sensory perception and the volatile profiles of the WMP based on the diet, with WMP from GRS and CLV more similar than WMP from TMR. Consumers scored WMP from CLV diets highest for overall acceptability, flavour and quality, and WMP from TMR diets highest for cooked flavour and aftertaste. ODP analysis found that WMP from TMR diets had greater caramelised flavour, sweet aroma and sweet taste, and that WMP from GRS diets had greater cooked aroma and cooked flavour, with WMP derived from CLV diets having greater scores for liking of colour and creamy aroma. Sixty four VOCs were identified, twenty six were found to vary significantly based on diet and seventeen of these were derived from fatty acids; lactones, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and esters. The abundance of delta-decalactone and delta-dodecalactone was very high in WMP derived from CLV and GRS diets as was gamma-dodecalactone derived from a TMR diet. These lactones appeared to influence sweet, creamy, and caramelised attributes in the resultant WMP samples. The differences in these VOC derived from lipids due to diet are probably further exacerbated by the thermal treatments used in WMP manufacture. Copyright ©The Author(s), 2022.

Food Control					Salmonella enterica serovar Indiana has become a widely prevalent non-typhoidal serovar in China in recent years. To improve the understanding of antimicrobial resistance and genetic bias in this emerging pathogen, a total of 214 S. Indiana isolates from foods, patients, and the environments in China from 2007 to 2016 were characterized for antimicrobial susceptibility, antimicrobial resistance-determining factors, and molecular typing. It was found that 208 (97.2%) exhibited resistance to ciprofloxacin, and 102 (47.7%) isolates to ceftriaxone. Ciprofloxacin resistance increased from 82.4% in 2007-2008 to 100.0% in 2015-2016. Ceftriaxone resistance increased from 29.4% in 2007-2008 to 47.1% in 2015-2016. In particular, the proportion of multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Indiana isolates increased from 64.7% in 2007-2008 to 91.4% in 2015-2016. Mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region (QRDR) (gyrA and parC), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes [aac (6)-Ib-cr, oqxAB, qnrA, qnrS, qnrB and qepA], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes (blaOXA, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaCMY and blaVEB), and class I integrons were identified in these S. Indiana isolates, along with transposon units of DeltaIS Ecp1-blaCTX-M-65-IS 903B, IS Ecp1-IS Vsa5-blaCTX-M-14-IS 903B, and IS Ecp1-blaCTX-M-55/15-Delta orf477. To our knowledge, the ESBL gene blaVEB was identified in Salmonella for the first time. Diverse plasmid types (IncHI2, IncN, IncA/C, IncFIB, IncI1 and IncFII) were identified in these isolates, among which IncHI2-type plasmid (49.1%) was the most common type in S. Indiana. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed a single ST17 in S. Indiana. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results showed that there was a genotypic diversity, and some clones might have existed in S. Indiana between patients and foods for several years. These findings suggested that the frequent emergence of S. Indiana isolates with resistance to ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone would pose a huge threat to food safety and public health.

J		Zenghui Dai; Linna Han; Zhe Li; Mengqing Gu; Zhigang Xiao; Fei Lu							Combination of chitosan, tea polyphenols, and nisin on the bacterial inhibition and quality maintenance of plant-based meat.		Foods					Plant-based meat products have gained attention in the food industry and with consumers. Plant-based meat products primarily comprise plant proteins and are rich in nutrients. However, the products are highly susceptible to bacterial contamination during storage. Biological preservatives are easily degradable alternatives to chemical preservatives and can preserve different kinds of food. In order to investigate the preservation properties of chitosan (CS), tea polyphenols (TPs), and nisin treatments on plant-based meats, the sensory evaluation, color difference, pH, TBARS, and the total plate count of E. coli, S. aureus, and Salmonella, indicators of the biological preservative-treated plant-based meat, were determined in this study. The experiment involved blank control- and biological preservative-treated samples. We found that the total microbial count exceeded the national standard provisions in the control samples stored for 14 days. The colors, tissue structures, and flavors of plant-based meat have gradually deteriorated, with the sensory score dropping from 90 to 52. The sample had a loose tissue structure and an obvious sour taste. However, the shelf life of the plant-based meat samples treated with different combinations of the biological preservatives increased compared to the shelf life of the control samples. After 56 d of storage, 1% chitosan, 2.5% tea polyphenols, and 0.04% nisin sensory reduction to 56, the total number of colonies and S. aureus were 4.91 and 2.95 lg CFU/g, approaching the national standard threshold; E. coli was 2 lg CFU/g, reaching the national standard threshold. Thus, the samples treated with 1% chitosan, 2.5% tea polyphenols, and 0.04% nisin had the longest shelf life (56 days) among all experimental groups. Hence, this study reveals that a combination of biological preservatives may be a non-toxic alternative for the efficient preservation of plant-based meat products. © 2022 by the authors.

Gathering scientific evidence for a new bioactive natural ingredient: the combination between chemical profiles and biological activities of Flueggea virosa extracts.		Food Bioscience					Flueggea virosa (Roxb. ex Willd.) Royle is a plant with several traditional uses in tropical countries. To study the potential usefulness, extracts from stem barks and leaves of F. virosa were obtained with different solvents. The phytochemical composition was assessed using LC-MS and NMR. Triterpenes, as oleanolic (0.05-88.09mg/g extract), and ursolic (0.03-94.36mg/g extract) acids were determined. In addition, ellagic and gallic acid derivatives were present in large concentrations in some of the extracts. Antioxidant (radical scavenging, reduction ability, and metal chelating) and enzyme inhibitory (cholinesterase, tyrosinase, amylase, and glucosidase) effects were assessed by in vitro chemical assays. The methanol extracts and infusions from both parts show higher antioxidant ability when compared with ethyl acetate extracts, and the antioxidant capacity was correlated with the total phenolic contents of the tested extracts. The extracts demonstrate enzyme inhibitory abilities on AChE and BChE, and multivariate approaches allowed for correlating the activities with the presence of triterpenoids (R > 0.8). Furthermore, molecular docking was used to get insights into the interactions between the triterpenoids and the tested enzymes. Together, these results indicate that F. virosa represents a significant source of naturally-occurring bioactive compounds that can be exploited as a new ingredient for the development of novel functional products with promising biological properties.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, a separation/pre-concentration procedure, ultrasound assisted-cloud point extraction with modified 2-aminobenzimidazole (2-ABzI), was developed for the extraction of trace Hg2+ and CH3Hg+ and from vinegar samples-modified copolymer coupled with Hg-binding chelator, 2-ABzI. The imidic copolymer was characterized, and used for detection of the enriched Hg species by spectrophotometer at 332 nm. The method is based on their pH-induced charge transfer sensitive complexation with copolymer matrix via 2-AmBzI moiety at pH 6.0 and 4.5, and their extraction into the mixed micellar phase of the mixed non-ionic/ionic surfactants as extractant/sensitivity enhancer. The variables influencing the extraction efficiency were optimized. From pre-concentration of 25-mL sample, with a changing calibration sensitivity and pre-concentration factor of 62.5, a good rectilinear relationship between absorbance and concentrations of Hg species in ranges of 1-15, 15-150 g L-1 was obtained. The detection limits are 0.30 and 0.31 g L-1, respectively. Its precision/accuracy were in range of 3.1-7.6 % and 90.5-96 % after spiking (n:5, for measurements of 5, 25 and 100 g L-1 in same day and three consecutive days). The matrix effect was also studied (n:3, 100 g L-1). The method is simple, cost-effective, fast, accurate, safe, highly stable and selective, which has successfully been applied to the speciation of mercury in vinegar.

J		Zengjiang Zhang; Bo Zheng; Yukuo Tang; Ling Chen							Starch concentration is an important factor for controlling its digestibility during hot-extrusion 3D printing.		Food Chemistry					Controlling the digestibility of starch by Hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) is a new way to achieve personalized customization of starch-based foods. In this study, structural changes and in vitro digestibility of rice, wheat and potato starch gel materials at different concentrations during hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) were studied, and their relationship was clarified. The results showed that increasing concentration of starch gel material could effectively resist the disruption of the ordered structure by hydrothermal and shear and then promoted the rearrangements of starch molecular chain. Interestingly, the newly formed ordered structure led to a significant increase in slowly digestible starch (SDS)+ resistant starch (RS) content of rice, wheat and potato starch-based printing samples at 25 % concentration, reaching 29.59%, 28.43% and 48.82%, respectively. Overall, starch concentration was found an important factor in regulating the ordered structure of printed samples and controlling its anti-digestibility during HE-3DP.

J		Zengqing Li; Jun Xi; Haiming Chen; Weijun Chen; Wenxue Chen; Qiuping Zhong; Ming Zhang							Effect of glycosylation with apple pectin, citrus pectin, mango pectin and sugar beet pectin on the physicochemical, interfacial and emulsifying properties of coconut protein isolate.		Food Research International					The present study aimed to investigate the effect of glycosylation with four different sources of pectin on the structural, interfacial and emulsifying properties of coconut protein isolate (CPI). The conjugates achieved the degree of graft of 59.11%, 52.80%, 41.39% and 39.26% for apple pectin, citrus pectin, mango pectin and sugar beet pectin, respectively. The covalent bonding of the conjugates was further confirmed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and FT-IR spectra. In addition, CD spectra exhibited that the conjugates had less alpha-helix and beta-sheet, and more random coil, resulting in more flexible and loose protein structure. Attributed to glycosylation and the strong steric hindrance effects of pectin, fluorescence intensity of the conjugates decreased significantly. Moreover, the solubility, soluble free sulfhydryl content, surface hydrophobicity, emulsifying activity and emulsifying stability of the conjugates improved significantly after glycosylation. The results of adsorption kinetics showed that glycosylation could increase interfacial pressure, adsorption and rearrangement rates of CPI at the oil-water interface. In summary, the glycosylation between CPI and the four different sources of pectin can significantly improve their emulsifying properties, in particular, citrus pectin and sugar beet pectin have more significant effects.

Investigating the influence of freezing rate and frozen storage conditions on a model sponge cake using synchrotron X-rays micro-computed tomography.		Food Research International					Synchrotron X-rays micro-computed tomography was applied to visualize and quantify 3D ice crystal changes into a model sponge cake after freezing and subsequent frozen storage. Model sponge cake samples were submitted to two different freezing rates (fast: 17.2°C min-1 and slow: 0.3°C min-1), then stored at constant and fluctuating temperatures over a two weeks period. 3D images were acquired at frozen state thanks to a thermostated cell (CellStat) and processed using a grey level based segmentation method. Image analysis revealed that the ice volume fraction is conserved during storage but ice crystal size and location change whatever the freezing rate and the storage conditions. Maximum local thicknesses increase both inside (from 20 m to 50 m) and outside (from 47 m to 70 m) the matrix during the fourteen days storage period. Both specific surface areas between starch and ice (SSAice/starch) and between air and ice (SSAair/ice) also evolve with storage duration: SSAice/starch decreases up to-30 % while SSAair/ice increases up to + 13 % depending on the freezing rates and the storage conditions. These results highlighted that, during storage, ice crystals evolve according to two different mechanisms depending on the freezing rate: fast freezing leads to a local redistribution of water both within the starch matrix and within the pores, while slow freezing results in both local redistribution within the starch matrix and water migration towards the pores. In addition, stable storage temperatures favor local water redistribution whereas water migration from the starch matrix towards the pores was greater in the case of fluctuating storage temperatures. This study shows that freezing and frozen storage conditions have a synergistic effect on the microstructure evolution of sponge cake due to recrystallization phenomena.

Food Microbiology					Aspergillus oryzae and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii are the perquisites microorganisms in food fermentation due to the broad application prospects of their secondary metabolites. The co-culture strategy simulates the naturally occurring ecology by developing artificial microbial communities. This strategy has also been widely adopted to investigate the novel secondary metabolites. In the present study, the effects of co-culture on extracellular and intracellular secondary metabolites of fungi in liquid culture were investigated through UPLC-QTOF-MS. Notably, A. oryzae could significantly inhibit the growth of Z. rouxii when A. oryzae and Z. rouxii were co-cultured. The results further indicated that the co-culture of fungi could affect the secondary metabolites and produce various metabolic pathways. Overall, this study will provide insights into fungal interactions and cell metabolism mechanisms, contributing to supplementing and enriching the fermentation potential of fungi.

Food Research International					Melanoidins, making general contribution to the food characteristics, are extensively generated in the production of Chinese traditional vinegar; however, their effect on flavor modification remains unknown. This study investigated the changes in the melanoidins of Zhenjiang aromatic vinegar (ZAV) during decoction, and the interactions of crude melanoidins (CM) and pure melanoidins (PM) from decocted and undecocted ZAV with mixed aroma compounds were compared. With the exception of C-N, O-H and C-H, chemical bonds and groups varied among the four types of melanoidins. However, CM and PM, obtained from decocted or undecocted vinegar, displayed generally similar structures, which resulted in their consistent retention of volatiles owning to the overall structure characteristics. Compared to aqueous solution, CM and PM from undecocted vinegar exhibited release, non-influence, or adsorption of flavors. However, melanoidins from decocted vinegar appeared the adsorption for all flavors but 2,3, 5,6-Tetramethylpyrazine with weakened release. Free low molecular weight (LMw) compounds would affect the volatiles retention. Total solids (TS) from undecocted vinegar adsorbed volatiles except diethyl succinate; however, TS from decocted vinegar released all flavors significantly. Therefore, the decocted melanoidins were beneficial for the persistence of aroma. This study provided a base for elucidating the formation of melanoidins in decoction procedure and their roles in flavor modification.

Herein, metabolic profiling was used to investigate the differential metabolites and metabolic pathways of A. oryzae and Z. rouxii co-culture in solid medium. The results demonstrated that the fungal breakage rate increased significantly, and the enzyme activity decreased in the co-culture. Furthermore, A. oryzae mycelium grew above the Z. rouxii. By detecting the metabolites of the fungus cell, an increase in the co-culture was detected in the contents of l-Arginine and l-Glutamate. On the other hand, the contents of l-Leucine and l-Isoleucine decreased and affected various metabolic pathways (Arginine biosynthesis, Isoleucine degradation and Valine biosynthesis). In summary, the results of this study support essential information regarding the interaction and cell metabolisms between food-brewing fungi.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soy sauce contains several nitrogen-containing compounds, most of which are proteins and their decomposition products during the fermentation process. These compounds include potentially harmful ammonium salts. In this study, the effects of changing the koji making and fermentation conditions of soy sauce on the ammonium salt and amino acid nitrogen content in soy sauce are researched. The results indicate that mixed microbial koji making can significantly influence the ammonium salt content in soy sauce, with the increase in the amount of microbial inoculated, the ammonium salt content exhibited an overall upward trend, and increase the total amount of free amino acids. Besides, the ammonium salt content and brine concentration was a significant negative correlation between the two. Moreover, as the temperature of koji making increases, the ammonium salt content first decreases and then increases, and the content of ammonium salt gradually decreased with the increasing fermentation temperature. This study demonstrates that changes in soy sauce brewing conditions will influence the formation of ammonium salts and amino acid nitrogen in soy sauce, providing a foundation for further optimization of the soy sauce brewing process.

Food Research International					Photodynamic technology (PDT) is an emerging non-thermal processing technique, however, due to a lack of edible photosensitizers, its application to the food industry is limited. To better understand sodium copper chlorophyll (SCC) feasibility as a photosensitizer, we analyzed the effects of PDT-SCC on Escherichia coli O157:H7 inactivation using different lighting times (15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min), lighting power (30, 60, 90, 120, and 150 W), and SCC concentrations (2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 mM). We showed that bactericidal effects depended on all three parameters, but the most suitable sterilization condition for E. coli occurred at 10 mM SCC, for 60 min at 120 W. We also investigated cell morphology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, the activity of three oxidative response enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX)), and ompA, ompF, uvrA, and recA expression. When compared with the control group, PDT-SCC destroyed bacterial morphology, increased ROS production, decreased antioxidant enzyme activity (SOD, CAT, and GPX), down-regulated membrane protein gene expression, including ompA and ompF, and up-regulated the DNA damage-repair related genes, uvrA and recA. Thus, bacterial rupture caused by oxidative damage could be the main mechanism underpinning PDT-SCC action.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Due to its low cost and high bioavailability, eggshell powder can be used as an additional calcium source in the diet. The purpose of the research is, to provide regain of the eggshell waste with eggshell powder added cookies that are made with a reliable method to remove microbiological contamination and examining the nutritional value and sensory properties of said cookies. The research; includes the sterilization of eggshell, adding the obtained eggshell powder from eggshell into cookies different proportions (3%, 6% and 9%), one of which is control (0%), determining the nutritional value of the cookies, and taste test of the cookies. As a result of the research, microbial growth was prevented on the eggshell surface. When eggshell powder was added to cookies with the proportions 0%, 3%, 6% and 9%, it was shown that the amount of calcium in 100g were 17.3, 655.3, 1022.8 and 1607.7mg respectively and the difference between the groups were statistically significant (p > 0.05). To determine the sensory properties, 30 female individuals were subjected to taste test. It has been shown that adding different proportions of eggshell powder causes small changes in the texture and sensory properties of the cookies (p>0.05). Considering the texture, sensory properties and calcium content of the cookies, it was determined that the best proportion of using eggshell powder was to add 6% to the cookie, and it would be beneficial to add eggshell powder prepared with nano technology to the diet of risky groups. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

J		Zernov, A.; Baruch, L.; Machluf, M.							Chitosan-collagen hydrogel microparticles as edible cell microcarriers for cultured meat.		Food Hydrocolloids					Offering conventional meat-like nutritional values and eating experience without harming animals or the environment, cultured meat from livestock animal cells is considered one of the leading solutions to the global food crisis. Cell microcarriers (MCs) have been widely used for the scalable expansion of anchorage-dependent cells for biotechnology applications as well as cultured meat. In the current work, however, we suggest a different concept in which edible MCs can be incorporated into the final product, thus avoiding costly harvesting steps, and contributing to its nutritional values, textures, and appearance. Through addressing the different technological and biological aspects, we present the development of edible hydrogel MCs from chitosan and collagen, edible materials with a wide range of applications in tissue engineering. The obtained composite MCs have a uniform spherical shape of 571mum diameter, a smooth surface, and suitable mechanical properties. These MCs support the attachment and rapid proliferation of mouse skeletal C2C12 myoblasts, rabbit smooth muscle cells, sheep fibroblasts, and bovine umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells, achieving complete coverage of the carrier surface within only a few days in culture. These findings indicate the high potential of the edible microcarriers as a platform for the development of prospective cultured meat products.

Here, chlorogenic acid (CGA) isomers, neochlorogenic acid (NCGA) and cryptochlorogenic acid (CCGA) were used to explore the binding selectivity and mechanism of lipase. An inhibition assay indicated that both CGA isomers had dose-dependent inhibitory effects on lipase; however, the inhibitory effect of NCGA was better (IC50: 0.647 mg/mL) than that of CCGA (IC50: 0.677 mg/mL). NCGA and CCGA formed complexes with lipase at a molar ratio of 1:1, and the electrostatic interaction force plays a major role in the lipase-CCGA system. Molecular dynamics studies demonstrated that NCGA had a greater impact on the structure of lipase. The multi-spectroscopic and modeling results explained the effects of micro-structural changes on the binding site, the interaction force and the inhibition rate of the isomers when they combined with lipase.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Resistant dextrin has broad application prospects as a functional dietary fibre. However, the structural mechanism underlying indigestibility has not yet been reported. The structures and properties of three types of resistant dextrins before and after simulated digestion were characterised. The results showed that the new glycosidic linkages and alpha-1,6 linkages dense distribution region were the main causes of resistance to digestive enzymes. Moreover, after the ordered crystal structure was damaged, new glycosidic linkages and 1,6-anhydro-beta-d-glucopyranose were concentrated on the short side chain, which was not conducive to the formation of double-helix structure, and the degree of branching (DB) increased. Thus, DB increased and negatively correlated with the degree of polymerisation and the average chain length. After adding transglycosidase, the dietary fibre content was higher than 70% and DB increased to 48.87%, indicating the strongest resistance to digestive enzymes. This study provides important information to produce resistant dextrin of higher indigestibility. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	11	7233	7244	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16070					FSTA:2023-02-Aj2947

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Plant protein-based meats have attracted great attention and their market is expanding rapidly. So far, most the plant protein-based meats in the market are single phase, thus their textures are somewhat different from real meats that contains multiphases including muscle (fibre) and fat (soft). In this work, soybean protein-based meats with two-phases (fibre and fat texture) were firstly developed. A unique fabrication processing including freeze-dry and second coagulation was designed and developed. The fibre fragment was prepared firstly by freeze drying bean curd (tofu); then it was immersed into fully absorbed soybean suspension containing a coagulant at lower temperature. Secondly, the fragment containing the soybean suspension was heated to 80°C for second coagulation and then pressed to remove moisture. The mechanical properties of the final products depend on both the protein fragment and soybean hydrogel that were added. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	10	6646	6653	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16010					FSTA:2023-01-Sa0289
J		Zerva, A.; Chorozian, K.; Mohammadi, M.; Topakas, E.							Transxylosylation of stevioside by a novel GH39 beta-xylosidase, and simultaneous valorization of agroindustrial byproducts.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni is becoming increasingly popular as a sweetener, due to its high steviol glycoside content. However, the bitter aftertaste of those compounds is an issue for consumers, which can be alleviated with the addition of glycosyl substituents to the molecule. beta-Xylosidases are known to transxylosylate various acceptors, mostly alcohols and sugars. In this work, a putative novel beta-xylosidase gene from Ruminiclostridium cellulolyticum was heterologously expressed in E. coli, purified and characterized. The recombinant enzyme RcXyl39A, belonging to CAZy family GH39, showed satisfactory thermostability and tolerance towards product inhibition, while it was active in a wide pH and temperature range. Surprisingly, RcXyl39A was shown to possess a relaxed substrate specificity, since it was able to cleave various synthetic substrates, but also polymeric xylans. RcXyl39A was applied to the transxylosylation of stevioside, using enzymatically hydrolyzed xylan as a mixture of donor sugars. After optimization of several process parameters, the final yield obtained for stevioside conversion reached 27.4 0.6 %. The results of the present study indicate that RcXyl39A could be applied to the saccharification of lignocellulosic biomass, but also to the synthesis of novel compounds with desirable properties.

J		Zetian Li; Gottschall, T.; Hahner, A.; Hummel, T.							Retronasal olfaction is relatively less affected in older individuals with subjectively normal olfactory function.		Food Quality and Preference					Background. Orthonasal and retronasal olfaction are intimately connected. Still, they exhibit differences. The present study aimed to compare orthonasal and retronasal olfaction at both suprathreshold and threshold levels in a healthy population considering age. Material and methods A total of 171 participants with subjective normal olfactory function were divided into 2 groups (Young = 98 participants, mean age = 25.8 5.3 vs. Old = 73 participants, mean age = 68.3 10.6) according to their age. Groups were compared in terms of orthonasal odor threshold and identification (Sniffin' sticks test), retronasal odor threshold (Odor delivery container) and identification (Taste powder). Results. Both orthonasal and retronasal olfaction decreased with age, while retronasal odor identification tended to decline to a lesser degree than orthonasal olfaction. In addition, retronasal odor identification ability of those unaware of their olfactory loss (hyposmia and anosmia) was less affected than their orthonasal olfaction. Age correlated negatively with orthonasal and retronasal olfaction. Orthonasal and retronasal olfaction related to each other. Conclusion. In older individuals retronasal odor identification appears to be less affected than orthonasal odor identification. This may be partly due to differential changes at the level of the olfactory mucosa. The maintained retronasal olfactory function probably helps to maintain the pleasures of eating, contributing to the unawareness of the gradual age-related olfactory loss.

International Journal of Food Properties					The effect of Beeswax (BW) coating and Neem leaf extract (NLE) dipping on the shelf life of tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) was investigated over a storage period of 36 days. The experiment was done by a factorial combination of four levels of NLE dipping (0, 15%, 20% and 25%) and BW coating (0, 3%, 6% and 9%) in randomized complete block design with three replications. It was observed that BW9*NLE25 significantly (P <.001) extended the shelf life of tomato fruits by eight days and effectively reduced weight loss by 55-68%, the changes in TA by 20-66.7%, PH by 6.3-14.1%, and TSS by 2.8-6.9%. Toward the end of the storage period (on the 28th day), BW9*NLE25 found to have 39.4% higher marketable fruits while reducing the percent decay by 96.1% compared to untreated tomato fruits. The study result showed that BW9*NLE25 could potentially be utilized to extend the shelf life and maintain the quality of tomato fruits by farmers, retailers, and wholesalers. © 2022 Biruk Zewdie, Tigist Tadesse Shonte and Kebede Woldetsadik.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					lambda-Carrageenase with high activity is an effective and environmentally friendly tool enzyme for the preparation of lambda-carrageenan oligosaccharides with various biological activities. Herein, a novel GH150 (glycoside hydrolases family 150) lambda-carrageenase OUC-CglA from Maribacter vaceletii was heterologously expressed, purified, and characterized. The recombinant OUC-CglA performs strict selectivity toward lambda-carrageenan with a specific activity of 418.7 U/mg under its optimal reaction conditions of 20°C and pH 7.0. Additionally, OUC-CglA is a typical cold-adapted lambda-carrageenase because it unfolds 90% and 63% of its maximum activity at 15 and 10°C, respectively. The hydrolysis process suggests that OUC-CglA is an endotype lambda-carrageenase with the final products consisting of lambda-neocarrabiose, lambda-neocarratetraose, lambda-neocarrahexaose, and other long-chain lambda-neocarrageenan oligosaccharides. As a result, high activity, cold-adaptation, and principal products of OUC-CglA make it a potential biocatalyst for the effective preparation of lambda-carrageenan oligosaccharides.										2022	70	38	12135	12142	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c05544					FSTA:2023-02-Tb0489

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cereal-legume intercropping systems are an environmentally friendly practice in sustainable agriculture. However, research on the interspecific interaction of nitrogen (N) between rice and aquatic legumes has rarely been undertaken. To address this issue, a pot experiment was conducted to investigate N utilization and the N interaction between rice and water mimosa (Neptunia oleracea Lour.) in an intercropping system. The root barrier patterns consisted of solid barrier (SB), mesh barrier (MB), and no barrier (NB) treatments. The N fertilizer application rates were low, medium, and high N rates. Results. The results showed that the NB treatment better facilitated rice growth compared with the MB and SB treatments. And the nitrate N content and urease activity of rice rhizospheric soil in the NB treatment were the highest of the three separated patterns. The ammonium N content in water mimosa rhizospheric soil and N2 fixation of water mimosa ranked as NB>MB>SB. Conclusions. The amount of N fixation by water mimosa was 4.38-13.64mg/pot, and the N transfer from water mimosa to rice was 3.97-9.54mg/pot. This can promote the growth of rice and reduce the application of N fertilizer. We suggest that the rice-water mimosa intercropping system is a sustainable ecological farming approach and can be applied in the field to facilitate rice production. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.			xiang, hui min/0000-0003-2617-911X							2022	102	1	156	166	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11342					FSTA:2022-03-Me1509

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cereal cultivation with legumes plays an important role in improving biodiversity and productivity. However, there are limited references concerning rice/legume mix-cropping in paddy fields. An aquatic leguminous plant, water mimosa (Neptunia oleracea Lour.), was introduced and a related field experiment of two seasons (early and late seasons in 2019) was carried out to explore the effects of rice/water mimosa mix-cropping on rice growth, yield, grain quality and soil nutrients in the present study. Three treatments-rice monocropping, rice/water mimosa intercropping and mix-cropping-were employed in this study. Results. Results. Showed that rice grew better with greater height, tiller number, chlorophyll content, actual photosynthetic efficiency [Y (II)], maximum photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm) and photochemical quenching coefficient (qP) in the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments. In addition, the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments increased nutrient uptake of nitrogen (N) by11.89-24.42%, phosphorous (P) by 17.75-36.61% and potassium (K) by 19.22-47.44%, and rice yield by 19.9% and 21.8%. Conversely, the non-photochemical quenching coefficient (NPQ), chalkiness degree and chalky rate of rice were lower in the intercropping and mix-cropping treatments relative to those in the monocropping treatments. Notably, soil alkali-hydrolysable N (AN), available P (AP) and K (AK) contents were the highest in the mix-cropping treatments among the three cropping systems. Conclusion. We suggest that rice/water mimosa mix-cropping is an environmentally friendly agroecological system with a higher output and can be extended for green rice production and largely applied in the paddy field. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	10	3972	3982	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11744					FSTA:2022-10-Me5921

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Microbial extracellular polysaccharides possess various beneficial characteristics and are potential prebiotic candidates. The extracellular polysaccharide BPS-1 was isolated from Bacillus thuringiensis (its production being optimized by response surface methodology) and subjected to high-cell-density fermentation. BPS-1 is a heteropolysaccharide (molecular weight 35.6 kDa) composed of rhamnose, arabinose, glucosamine, galactose, glucose, and mannose in respective molar ratios 3.7:1.7:4.5:1:3.1:1.1. Its functional groups and structural features were characterized by FT-IR and NMR. The cytotoxicity of BPS-1 was evaluated against HcoEpiC and LoVo cell lines. BPS-1 was also evaluated for its potential effects on human gut microbiota in an in vitro fermentation model. During 48 h of anaerobic fermentation by healthy human fecal bacteria, BPS-1 significantly enhanced the production of short-chain fatty acids and increased the relative abundance of beneficial bacterial genera. This is the first report of the prebiotic potential of BPS-1 produced by Bacillus thuringiensis and provides a basis for its application in the food industry.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effects of red lentil protein with ultrasound-assisted enzymatic treatment on the quality of brown rice noodles were investigated. The thermostability and anti-retrogradation ability of brown rice flour decreased significantly (P<0.05), while the elastic and viscous modulus increased after adding untreated red lentil protein. Meanwhile, the cooking loss rate of brown rice noodles increased from 4.41% to 5.68%. When the red lentil protein was treated with ultrasound and enzyme, the protein-starch interaction was enhanced, and the negative effects of protein on brown rice flour and noodles were weakened. Moreover, the rice noodles with ultrasound-assisted enzyme-treated red lentil protein showed a lower starch digestibility than brown rice noodles, and its protein digestibility was significantly higher than that of rice noodles with ultrasound or enzyme-treated protein. Therefore, the addition of ultrasound-assisted enzyme-treated red lentil protein could effectively decrease predicted glycaemic index value, improve nutritional value and produce high-quality brown rice noodles. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	2	1150	1160	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15483					FSTA:2022-05-Mq2553

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of particle size (60-80, 80-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-300, and >300 mesh) on the properties of glutinous rice flour and sweet dumpling qualities were investigated under the same starch damage. As the particle size decreased, the freeze-thaw stability and loss tangent of rice flour increased, while the elastic and viscous modulus decreased. When the particle size of rice flour was smaller than 150 mesh, the prepared sweet dumplings exhibited dense structure, strong water retention capacity, and low cooking loss rate. However, when the particle size was smaller than 300 mesh, the prepared sweet dumplings showed undesirable quality which was mainly characterized by severe water loss, soft texture, and poor chewiness. Comprehensive consideration, the most suitable particle size of rice flour for sweet dumpling production was 150-200 mesh. The results could provide a reference for the quality evaluation of rice flour in the sweet dumpling industry. Practical applications. In the sweet dumpling industry, the rice flour was usually evaluated by making sweet dumplings rather than objective data, which enhanced the difficulty of production and caused the uneven quality of sweet dumplings. To simplify the evaluation of rice flour, this study controlled the damaged starch content and explored the effects of particle size on the rice flour properties and sweet dumpling qualities. The results showed that the appropriate particle size of rice flour for sweet dumpling production is 150-200 mesh. This study provided theoretical guidance for evaluating the quality of rice flour and had important implications in the development of the sweet dumpling industry. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16388					FSTA:2022-07-Mq4001

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study characterized Yersinia enterocolitica and other Yersinia spp. Isolated from retail and processed meats sampled in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China (2018-2019). The detection rate of Yersinia-positive samples was 14.30% (86/600). Yersinia was commonly prevalent in beefs (32.00%), frozen meats (25.00%), packaged meats (21.65%), and meats from supermarkets (17.23%). Y. enterocolitica was identified as the most prevalent species (50.00%, 62/124), followed by Y. frederiksenii (24.19%), Y. intermedia (16.94%), and Y. kristensenii (8.87%). Most Y. enterocolitica isolates were of bio-serotype 1A/nt (67.74%). Sixty-three isolates (50.81%) carried ystB and two isolates (1.61%) carried rfbC. Yersinia isolates were commonly resistant to ampicillin (91.94%), cefazolin (71.77%), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (56.45%), cefoxitin (28.23%), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (1.61%). Sixty-six isolates (53.23%) were resistant to three or more antibiotics. Pulse field gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that the genetic homology of Yersinia isolates between pork, beef, and chicken was low, as was that of biotype 1A isolates. The results indicate that Y. enterocolitica and other Yersinia spp. (especially bio-serotype 1A/nt, ampicillin-resistant, and ystB-carrying strains) are prevalent in retail and processed meats in the study area, which provides valuable baseline data for food safety and public health safeguarding.

J		Zeyad Albahr; Al-Ghamdi, S.; Juming Tang; Shyam S. Sablani							Pressure-assisted thermal sterilization and storage stability of avocado puree in high barrier polymeric packaging.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The main objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of developing shelf stable avocado puree processed with pressure-assisted thermal sterilization (PATS). A pressure of 600 MPa and initial vessel temperature of 90°C was used over 5min processing time. Two high barrier polymeric packages were used: Film A-PE/PA6//EVOH and Film B-AlOx-coated PET//AlOx-coated PET//AlOx-coated PET//ONy//CPP. Ascorbic acid with concentration of 0.4g/kg of avocado was added to puree to enhance its color stability (pH 6.6). Results showed that the weight loss was lower in package B (0.5%) than in package A (4-5%) over 104 days of storage at 23°C. Instrumental color (greenness) of the puree in both packaging changed significantly (p>0.05) during storage despite the addition of ascorbic acid; however, total color changes of puree in film B were lower than film A. There was no significant (p>0.05) degradation of chlorophyll concentrations of PATS-processed avocado during storage. The dissolve oxygen concentration in avocado puree during storage was stable and the maximum normalized dissolve oxygen was less than 1%. Lipid oxidation of the fortified and plain avocado puree packaged in films A and B was stable with no significant (p>0.05) changes during storage. Total plate count of avocado puree after PATS and during the 3months of storage was below the detection limit. The results suggest that shelf stable avocado puree with limited shelf life could be developed using the PATS process. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	11	2616	2628	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-022-02904-2					FSTA:2023-01-Jg1061

Food Control					Chicken breast, a food rich in protein, was deep-fried in soybean oil (SBO) at 140, 175 and 190°C for 20 continuous batches, and the profiles of acid value (AV), peroxide value (PV), 2-tert-Butyl-1,4-dihydrobenzoquinone (TBHQ), and 2-tert-Butyl-1,4-benzoquinone (TBBQ) in SBO and fried chicken breast were determined. The results suggested that frying at 140°C produced increased conversion of TBHQ to TBBQ and oxidation of the frying oil than at 175°C, which was close to that found at 190°C. The highest TBBQ peak concentration of 2.89 0.12 and 13.88 0.27 mg/kg for fried chicken breast and frying oil corresponded to the 7th and 6th frying batch at 140°C, respectively. The experimental results on determination of the AV, PV, moisture and the content of oxygen in frying oil suggested that more moisture and oxygen were retained in oil when frying at 140°C than that at 175°C, which may explain the over-conversion of TBHQ to TBBQ when frying at low temperature. The results on aeration frying and water injection frying experiments indicated that moisture and oxygen had a great impact on the oxidation of TBHQ in frying oil.

Food Science & Nutrition					There has been interest in the use of plant extract as a natural preservative agent for improving the oxidative stability of vegetable oils. However, plant extracts have low stability against heat and environmental stress. In this study, the antioxidant potential of nano-and microencapsulated Rosmarinus officinalis L. extract (RE) obtained using the ultrasonication method was measured. The total phenolic and flavonoid content of the extract was 174.4 25.9mg gallic acid/g extract and 78.30 3.2mg rutin/g extract, respectively. Antioxidant activity of 50, 100, 200, and 400 ppm of RE was measured by DPPH free radical scavenging methods, ferric reduction assay, and beta-carotene/linoleic acid assay, and then compared to the 100 ppm of TBHQ as a common synthetic antioxidant. The results showed that the antioxidant activity increased with increasing the concentration of the extract in all evaluating methods. The antioxidant activity of 200 ppm of the free and encapsulated extract in cress (Lepidium sativum) and basil (Ocimum basilicum) seed gums at different ratios (1:0, 1:1, and 0:1) was compared to sunflower oil without antioxidants, and oil-containing TBHQ which was stored at 60°C for 24 days. The oxidation indexes of oil samples include peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid value, and p-anisidine value measured at 4-day intervals. A lower oil oxidation was observed in oil-containing nanoencapsulated extract followed by microencapsulated extract, free extract, and TBHQ. Since producing nanoencapsulated RE requires a higher time and speed of homogenization and due to no statistically significant difference between the antioxidant properties of nanocapsules and microcapsules in oil, the use of microcapsules of RE in basil seed gum to increase the shelf life of sunflower oil is recommended. © 2022 The Authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Recently, human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) have attracted increasing attention and display great commercial importance, especially for the infant formula industry. Lacto-N-tetraose (LNT) is an important neutral HMO commercially added in infant formula and a core structure for synthesizing complex HMOs. Previously, a novel LNT-generating beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase from Pseudogulbenkiania ferrooxidans was identified and used for construction of an LNT-producing engineered Escherichia coli. In this work, LNT biosynthesis was further enhanced by pathway optimization and uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP) regeneration. The main strategies included genomic integration of UDP-glucose 4-epimerase-encoding gene, fine-tuning of the LNT pathway-related genes, blocking of competitive pathways related to UDP-galactose, and overexpression of UTP supply related genes. The maximal LNT titer reached 6.16 and 57.5g/L by shake-flask and fed-batch fermentation, respectively.										2022	70	25	7727	7735	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02426					FSTA:2022-11-Bk1876

Therefore, a species-level method is necessary to clarify the diversity in Pseudomonasspp. In this study, a housekeeping gene (mreB) was screened using genomic analysis, which has the ability to distinguish Pseudomonas at species level. Based on this gene, a Pseudomonas-specific primer pair targeting hypervariable region was designed. The primers could specifically distinguish Pseudomonas from other genus but also identify between 142 species in this genus. Using the Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing platform, we proposed a method to rapidly identify Pseudomonas in complex samples and assessed the specificity, accuracy and sensitivity (LOD) of the method. The results showed that this novel approach was reliable and could directly detect as low as 2.648 logCFU/mL of Pseudomonas species. We surveyed the dynamic variation of Pseudomonas at different low temperatures and storage times, different processing points on farms. In conclusion, this method provides a high-throughput sequencing approach to detect more Pseudomonas in susceptible foods material such as milk and meat, which will contribute to analyzing the effect of environmental factor to Pseudomonas community at species level.

J		Zeyu Wang; Jinbao Huang; Dawei Yun; Huimin Yong; Jun Liu							Antioxidant packaging films developed based on chitosan grafted with different catechins: characterization and application in retarding corn oil oxidation.		Food Hydrocolloids					Four catechins including (-)-epicatechin (EC), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG), (-)-epigallocatechin (EGC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) were conjugated onto chitosan (CS) molecules via ascorbate radical mediated reaction, producing EC-g-CS, ECG-g-CS, EGC-g-CS and EGCG-g-CS. The four catechin-g-CSs were individually blended with CS to develop food packaging films. The structure, physicochemical properties and antioxidant activity of four catechin-g-CSs as well as their corresponding packaging films were compared. Results showed the total phenol content differed in four catechin-g-CSs, where ECG-g-CS and EGCG-g-CS had higher total phenol contents than EC-g-CS and EGC-g-CS. Four catechin-g-CSs showed the characteristic UV-vis, infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance signals of catechins, revealing the successful conjugation of CS with catechins. Antioxidant activity of CS was elevated by catechins to different degrees, with EGCG-g-CS having the highest antioxidant activity. The developed CS/catechin-g-CSs films showed larger thickness, water solubility, tensile strength, elongation at break, thermal stability and antioxidant activity but lower light transmittance, water contact angle, water vapor and oxygen permeability in comparison with CS film. Meanwhile, CS/catechin-g-CSs films had good anti-permeability against corn oil and effectively retarded the increase of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and peroxide value levels during oil storage. Findings showed CS/catechin-g-CSs films were ideal antioxidant packaging materials for edible oils.

Ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing of prepared ground pork: effects on thawing time, product quality, water distribution and microstructure.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of air thawing (AT), water immersion thawing (WIT), and ultrasound-assisted immersion thawing (UIT) with different power density (90, 120 and 150 W/L) on the thawing time, product quality and water distribution as well as microstructure of prepared ground pork (PGP) were investigated. The UIT treatments significantly shortened thawing time by 40.74-59.26% compared with the AT method (P< 0.05). The UIT-120 W/L treatments had better color, water holding capacity, and texture, and the best microstructure. The 150 W/L UIT treatments induced severely damaged muscle structure and significantly decreased the quality (P< 0.05). The UIT-120 W/L treatment could improve the thawing efficiency and quality of PGP samples.

Z.; Xiuhua Liu							Oil-in-water emulsions prepared using high-pressure homogenisation with Dioscorea opposita mucilage and food-grade polysaccharides: guar gum, xanthan gum, and pectin.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, oil-in-water emulsions made of medium-chain triglycerides (MCT), mucilage from Dioscorea opposita (DOM), and food-grade polysaccharides (guar gum [GG], xanthan gum [XG] and pectin [Pec]) were prepared using high-pressure homogenisation. The droplet size distributions, microstructure, turbidity, interfacial tension, creaming index, and stability of emulsions were investigated and compared with those of DOM, GG, XG and Pec. The results showed that 0.4 wt% food-grade polysaccharides (GG, XG, and Pec) with 2 wt% DOM contributed more to the stability of the emulsion during storage. In particular, low concentrations of pectin and DOM emulsions presented smaller droplet size distribution, in the range of 86.34-111.30 nm. Hence, DOM has synergistic effects with food-grade polysaccharides, which could improve the stability of emulsions, suggesting that mucilage from Dioscorea opposita has good potential for use as a natural emulsifier.

J		Zhan Luo; Zhanzhong Wang							The role of starch granule-associated proteins in enhancing the strength of indica rice starch gels.		Food Hydrocolloids					The gel properties of indica rice starch strongly influence the quality of foods in which it is used. This study investigated the effects of chymotrypsin treatment on the rheological and pasting properties of starch prepared by different treatment methods. The results demonstrated that all the starches contained starch granule-associated proteins (SGAPs). Specifically, chymotrypsin-treated fermented extracted starch (E-FS) and chymotrypsin-treated alkali extracted starch (E-AS) exhibited a storage modulus (G′) about 4 times higher than that of fermented extracted starch (FS) and alkali-extracted starch (AS). The flow consistency coefficients (K), loss moduli (G) and setback values tended to increase, while the characteristic rheological indices (n) and loss tangent (tan delta) tended to decrease after chymotrypsin treatment. This suggested that the starch gel was significantly enhanced by the proteinase modification. The protein composition of AS and E-AS only contained the 66 kDa of granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS I) subunit. Therefore, the significant increase in gel strength was attributed to the exclusive modification effects of GBSS I. Microstructural analysis also confirmed that the three-dimensional gel network of indica rice starch was formed by a backbone of SGAP polymers filled with starch granules. The mechanism underlying GBSS I-enhanced gel was also elucidated based on the sequence and structure of GBSS I. The gel network formed by SGAP polymers of FS and AS was mainly caused by disulfide bonds between GBSS Is, while that of E-FS and E-AS was mainly caused by hydrophobic interactions.

J		Zhan Ye; Yong-Jiang Xu; Yuanfa Liu							Different typical dietary lipid consumption affects the bile acid metabolism and the gut microbiota structure: an animal trial using Sprague-Dawley rats.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The palm oil (PO), leaf lard oil (LO), rapeseed oil (RO), sunflower oil (SO) and linseed oil (LN) are five of the most typical dietary lipids in most Asian countries. However, their influences on gut health, and the connections between the fatty acid composition, the gut microbiota, and the bile acid metabolism are not fully understood. Results. In the present study, results showed that compared with polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA)-rich SO and LN, the saturated fatty acid (SFA)-rich and monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-rich PO, LO and RO were more likely to decrease the re-absorption of bile acid in the colon, which was probably caused by their different role in modulating the gut microbiota structure. LO consumption significantly up-regulated the Cyp27a1, FXR and TGR5 gene expression level (P<0.05). The correlation results suggested that the C18:0 was significantly positive correlated with these three genes, indicating that intake of SFA-rich dietary lipids, especially for the C18:0, could specifically increase the bile acid production by stimulating the bile acid alternative synthesis pathway. Although the bile acid receptor expression in the colon was increased, the re-absorption of bile acid did not show a significant increase (P>0.05) as compared with other dietary lipids. Moreover, the C18:2-rich SO maintained the bile acid metabolic balance probably by decreasing the Romboutsia, while increasing the Bifidobacterium abundance in the colon. Conclusions. The different dietary lipids showed different effects on the bile acid metabolism, which was probably connected with the alterations in the gut microbiota structure. The present study could provide basic understandings about the influences of the different dietary lipids consumption on gut homeostasis and bile acid metabolism. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	8	3179	3192	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11661					FSTA:2022-09-Ne2085

Stability profiling and degradation products of dihydromyricetin in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium.		Food Chemistry					Dihydromyricetin has shown many bioactivities in cell level. However, dihydromyricetin was found to be highly instable in cell culture medium DMEM. Here, the underlying degradation mechanism was investigated via UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Dihydromyricetin was mainly converted into its dimers and oxidized products. At lower temperature, dihydromyricetin in DMEM showed higher stability. Vitamin C increased the stability of dihydromyricetin in DMEM probably due to its high antioxidant potential. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Food Research Journal					Potato starch was modified by oxidation with different concentrations of active chlorine (0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0%); and the physicochemical properties of the oxidised potato starch samples and the use of these starches in set yogurt were investigated as a function of their degree of oxidation. The carboxyl content, carbonyl content, and solubility of the oxidised starches increased with increasing sodium hypochlorite concentrations, while the swelling power decreased. Scanning electron microscopy showed that oxidation caused cracks or pores on the surfaces of the starch granules, and these morphological changes were enhanced by increased oxidant concentrations. Analysis with a Rapid Visco Analyser showed that high degrees of oxidation could improve the starch thermodynamic stability and resistance to retrogradation. Set yogurts made with oxidised potato starches had higher water-holding capacities, higher apparent viscosities, and better sensory qualities than those prepared with native starch.										2022	29	3	582	592	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.3.11					FSTA:2022-11-Pl5193

Food Chemistry					This work reports a sensitive and accurate multimode detection method to detect Salmonella typhimurium using inherent color, photothermal and catalytic properties of Prussian blue@gold nanoparticles (PB@Au). The inherent color of PB@Au can realize direct visual detection while the temperature increase (DeltaT) of it can realize sensitive and quantitative photothermal detection. Moreover, catalytic coloration detection is applied to further amplify detection signal. The risk limit, prevention and control of Salmonella typhimurium can be more intuitively displayed through catalytic color overlap degree between PB@Au and catalytic product. The sensitivity of method is improved through photothermal and catalytic coloration detection (101 CFU.mL-1) compared with direct visual detection (102 CFU.mL-1). The multimode detection improves the accuracy of method, and exhibits good repeatability, acceptable selectivity and stability. This method is also successfully applied in real samples, displaying its good practical applicability.

International Food Research Journal					Free and glycosidically bound volatiles are two essential aroma compounds contributing to the flavour of nectarine fruits. To explore the relationship between free and bound volatiles in nectarine fruits during postharvest storage, they were first harvested and then subjected to the temperatures of 1, 5, and 8°C for 35 d, and the changes in volatile compounds, beta-glucosidase (beta-Glu) activity, and the expression of UGT (UDP-glucosyltransferase) involved in the accumulation of bound linalool were determined. Results showed that nectarine fruits stored at 5°C had the lowest contents of free volatile compounds due to damage from chilling injury, and the contents of esters and lactones decreased at 1 and 5°C. The contents of bound volatiles increased during the early storage period, and decreased afterwards due to an increase in beta-Glu activity. Corresponding to the higher contents of bound volatiles at 1°C, the beta-Glu activity in nectarine fruits stored at 1°C was significantly lower than that in nectarine fruits stored at the other two temperatures.										2022	29	4	843	856	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.4.11					FSTA:2023-01-Jg0647

International Journal of Food Properties					The mechanical characteristics of apples are crucial to the mechanization of apple production. In this study, the mechanical characteristics of the Fuji apple with the largest crop yield were studied by testing the tensile strength, compression strength, shear strength, bending strength, hardness, friction coefficient, and microstructure. The obtained minimum values of the elastic modulus, yield strength, shear strength, bending strength, and compressive strength were 5.0 0.52, 2.2 0.15, 0.45 0.02, 0.062, and 2.4 0.21 MPa, respectively, all located at the maximum radial radius of the pulp. The hardness decreased gradually with storage time: the hardness of the pulp after 28 days was 0.16 0.02 MPa. The static friction coefficients against TPU (Thermoplastic Urethane) rubber and aluminum alloy materials were 0.88 0.03 and 0.14 0.003, respectively. The microstructure of the peel and pulp changed significantly after damage. The regular shape was destroyed, and the cells deformed and ruptured. The changes in the microstructure were consistent with the changes in the macromechanical properties, so the reliability of the test data could be verified. © 2022 Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	25	1	1773	1791	1094-2912				10.1080/10942912.2022.2107006					FSTA:2023-03-Je4941

International Food Research Journal					In the present work, Listeria monocytogenes was used as the target strain to investigate the sterilising potential and mechanism of high power pulse microwave (HPPM). Results showed that the inactivation was positively correlated with the pulse frequencies and operating times. The count of Listeria monocytogenes was decreased by 5.09 log CFU/mL under 200 Hz for 9 min, which was used as the optimised condition to further explore the sterilisation mechanism. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images showed that the L. monocytogenescells of untreated group presented intact surfaces, clear boundary, and its intracellular contents distributed uniformly in the cytoplasm. Following treatment, the cell wall surfaces began to deform in small areas, and cell membranes were severely ruptured, thus resulting in the appearance of electron transmission areas. Extracellular protein and nucleic acid contents, represented by OD260 nm and OD280 nm, increased with the increase in operating time significantly. After treatment, SDS-PAGE profiles of whole-cell proteins displayed that the protein bands became lighter or even disappeared. Na+ K+ -ATPase activities and intracellular ATP content decreased by 72.97 and 79.09%, respectively. This was consistent with the cell viability of L. monocytogenes observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Overall, the sterilisation mechanism of HPPM onL. monocytogenes may be caused by membrane damage, intracellular component leakage, and energy metabolism hindrance.										2022	29	5	1168	1178	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.5.18					FSTA:2023-03-Cd1089

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Oudemansiella radicata is a precious mushroom widely cultivated in China with mature cultivation techniques. The extraction efficiency and biological activity of polysaccharides are crucial for the utilization of O. radicata. In this study, the effects of dehydration (hot air drying and freeze-drying) and extraction methods (heat-reflux extraction, ultrasound-assisted extraction and maceration extraction) on the physicochemical properties and antioxidant activities of Oudermansiella radicata polysaccharides (ORPs) were investigated. Six polysaccharides were obtained, and experimental results indicated that physicochemical and antioxidant properties of ORPs were different from each other after the treatment of various dehydration and extraction techniques. Based on correlation analysis, the antioxidant activities of the ORPs could be attributed to the uronic acid content, molecular weight, and glucose and mannose contents. The freeze-drying and ultrasound-assisted methods are promising and alternative techniques for obtaining ORPs considering their high yield and notable antioxidant activity.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The main objective of this study was to optimize the fermentation conditions of goji and to analyze the sugar, organic acid, amino acid, and flavor compounds before and after the fermentation of goji. Based on the single-factor experiment, orthogonal array design and the range analysis, the optimized conditions for fermented goji were 30% raw material concentration, 28h fermentation time and 0.05% inoculum size, respectively. Under optimal conditions, the biomass of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NCU137 and sensory score of fermented goji reached to 8.84 0.05 log CFU/g and 81.3 1.5, respectively. After fermentation, the content of malate, succinic acid, and lactate increased, while the content of pyruvate, glucose, fructose, and the overall free amino acid decreased. After fermentation, volatile components except for the phenols and acids are declining. This study would provide theoretical basis and experimental data for the industrialization of Lycium barbarum fermentation. Novelty impact statement. After Lactiplantibacillus plantarum NCU137 fermentation, the contents of organic acids and total acidity acid in fermented goji significantly increased, which could inhibit microbiological spoilage and growth. Moreover, we get a delicious fermented goji juice through the optimization of fermentation conditions. Therefore, the data obtained in this study provides a better understanding of the effects of raw material content, fermentation time, and inoculum size on the quality of fermented goji, which would be very beneficial for the production of high-quality fermented goji for subsequent consumption. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16828					FSTA:2023-03-Jf4012

Food Chemistry					The aging procedure/storage is essential to enhance the organoleptic quality of strong flavor baijiu (SFB). How the storage affects flavor changes in SFB, that is, the aging mechanisms remains unclear. Herein, the physical and chemical effects on the main flavor compounds of SFB during storage were investigated using the density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. DFT calculation results showed that the activation energy of ester alkyl-oxygen protonation was lower than that of acid hydroxyl-oxygen protonation, which explained the reason why the concentrations of acids increased and those of esters decreased during SFB storage. MD simulation results showed that electrostatic interaction was a major contributor to SFB and that the ethanol-water system containing acids had a stronger electrostatic energy and more hydrogen bonds than the ethanol-water system containing esters. These findings revealed that acids are prone to generating and strengthening associative structures in SFB during storage.

Food Bioscience					Phospholipids have been recognized as significant functional lipids related to nutrition, while they were complex and multiple, and their sources were various. Bioactive functions of phospholipids in skeletal muscle were given serious attention; however, studies on dietary phospholipid profiles with functions on skeletal muscle were rarely reported. Here, we analyzed phospholipid profiles of four kinds of dietary phospholipids (including yolk phospholipid, soybean phospholipid, perilla seed phospholipid and krill oil phospholipid) and compared their composition differences using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS. Lipidomics emphasized significant differences in compositions. Krill oil phospholipid rich in omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 LCPUFAs) showed the most excellent effect in skeletal muscle protection. Compared with triglyceride-type lipid (fish oil), phospholipids had higher bioavailability. Besides, as for a higher degree of unsaturation of phospholipid, they did not always perform better effects, which might be related to being more susceptible to suffering from oxidative stress. Overall, four representative phospholipids were analyzed and compared for their bioactive function in skeletal muscle, providing a reference for better understanding relationships between structures and functional applications of phospholipids.

Food Hydrocolloids					The interactions between different phospholipids (yolk phospholipid, soybean phospholipid, and perilla seed phospholipid) and whey protein isolate (WPI) were studied. Physical characteristics and bioaccessibility of different emulsions were compared. According to the results of multiple spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and molecular docking, hydrophobic interactions played an important role in the interaction of phospholipid and WPI, enhanced as more unsaturation. Dynamic light scattering showed that combination of phospholipids and proteins could decrease particle sizes (from 232.33 4.79 nm to 188.59 2.61 nm) and improve emulsion stability significantly (from-34.26 1.31mV to-49.13 1.91mV), presenting dose-dependency. Microstructure results indicated that phospholipids would contribute to dispersity and homogeneity of emulsions. Furthermore, the phospholipid-WPI emulsion can be an efficient tool for functional lipid delivery and improving the functional lipid ratios in the zebrafish model. Compared to WPI emulsions, the phospholipid-WPI emulsion group exhibited higher ratios of functional lipids in zebrafish fatty acid compositions (up to 29.41% 0.87%). In vitro digestion supported that perilla seed phospholipid-WPI emulsions would contribute to a higher bioaccessibility of EPA (from 36.59% 0.88%-53.08% 0.96%), DHA (from 36.42% 1.03%-54.10% 1.07%) and astaxanthin (from 31.54% 2.52%-53.31% 4.05%). Overall, our research can be useful to an efficient delivery system for functional lipids with phospholipid-protein structures.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The changes in lipid compositions of krill oil emulsions during storage were investigated, as well as the role of ultrasound treatment. Whey protein isolate (WPI) was used as wall materials to krill oil, which was treated with ultrasound. The effects of WPI concentration (from 0.2% to 10%), ultrasound power (from 10% to 80%) and treatment (at the same energy density with different power) were evaluated. Storage stability of different emulsions was characterised appearance, particle sizes, zeta potential, polydispersity index and microstructures. The lipid compositions and interactions were analysed to debate the changes of emulsions. The results indicated that ultrasound increased the stability of emulsions, enhanced the hydrophobic interactions between WPI and lipids and kept lipid composition distributions in each layer of emulsions. Furthermore, a possible mechanism of lipid migration in krill oil emulsions was put forward. The study will assist in the application and mechanism of krill oil emulsions treated with ultrasound. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	11	7066	7075	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16044					FSTA:2023-02-Nh0478

Food Hydrocolloids					Impacts of ball milling (BM) (4, 6, 8, 10 h) combined with high-pressure homogenization (HPH) (60 and 100 MPa, 4 cycles) on structure, physicochemical and rheological properties of citrus fiber were investigated. Compared with single BM treatment, particle size of combined treatment citrus fiber significantly reduced. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) demonstrated that BM combined with HPH unfolded flaky structure of citrus fiber and caused more pores occurred. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis (FTIR) indicated that combined treatment increased its hydroxyl. At BM 4 h combined with HPH 100 MPa, water holding capacity (WHC), oil holding capacity (OHC), water swelling capacity (WSC), DPPH, ABTS+-radical scavenging capacity and apparent viscosity of citrus fiber increased by 144.74%, 884.52%, 109.56%, 43.90%, 56.80% and 180.49%, respectively, whereas median particle size (D50) decreased by 65.24%, compared with single BM treatment. Therefore, BM combined with HPH was an effective physical treatment to modify citrus fiber, remarkably changing its spatial structure and improving its physicochemical properties and apparent viscosity, thus providing a theoretical basis for food industry to obtain excellent citrus fibers.

International Dairy Journal					The effect of pH-shifting treatment combined with ultrasound on physicochemical and functional properties of whey protein isolate (WPI) was investigated. After pH 2- or pH 11-shifting (1, 2 and 3 h) and ultrasound treatment (600 W, 30 min), particle size distribution of WPI became narrower and its fluorescence intensity decreased significantly. After WPI was treated with pH 11-shifting for 3 h and ultrasound, it showed the maximum surface hydrophobicity and lowest turbidity (P< 0.05). Meanwhile, pH 2-shifting treatment (3 h) combined with ultrasound could improve emulsion stability of WPI. However, consecutive pH 11-shifting (1-3 h) and ultrasound significantly reduced the emulsifying properties of WPI.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Grapes are cultivated worldwide and are favored by consumers for their delicious taste and nutritional value. Grey mould, caused by Botrytis cinerea, leads to considerable loss of postharvest grape fruit each year. Sulfur dioxide fumigation is widely used to inhibit grey mould of grape around the world, but there is still a lack of research on its antimicrobial mechanism, especially at molecular level. In present study, we explored the molecular mechanisms of sulfur dioxide against B. cinerea in vitro and in vivo, respectively, using the sulfur dioxide donor sodium pyrosulfite. The results indicated that sodium pyrosulfite treatment could inhibit the expression of genes in antioxidant system and sulfur metabolism pathway of B. cinerea. The down-regulated genes in sulfur metabolism were mainly involved in the process of assimilatory sulfate reduction, limiting the synthesis of sulfur-containing organic compounds. Furthermore, the expressions of several critical antioxidant genes were suppressed under the sodium pyrosulfite stress. The decrease of antioxidant capacity led to ROS accumulation in B. cinerea cell, resulting in the decrease of the survival rate. These results not only richen our understanding of the antimicrobial mechanisms of sulfur dioxide against B. cinerea at the molecular level, but also are beneficial for us to improve sulfur dioxide product in the future.

J		Zhanrui Huang; Jing Sun; Liangzhong Zhao; Wanying He; Teyuan Liu; Binbin Liu							Analysis of the gel properties, microstructural characteristics, and intermolecular forces of soybean protein isolate gel induced by transglutaminase.		Food Science & Nutrition					Soybean protein isolate (SPI) is a high-quality plant protein that is primarily used to process various soybean products coagulated by transglutaminase (TGase). In this study, the degree of hydrolysis (DH), sulfhydryl content (SH), surface hydrophobicity (H), secondary structural constitution, and microstructure of TGase-treated soybean protein (SPI, 7S, and 11S) were determined, as well as the effects of NaCl, urea, and SDS on the properties and intermolecular forces of SPI gel were analyzed. The results show that the H and SH content of SPI, 7S, and 11S decreased significantly with TGase treatment time (p<.05), while the DH gradually increased and reached its highest value (3.72%, 7.41%, and 1.27%, respectively) at 30min. As the concentration of these two secondary structures exhibited an inverse relationship, the degradation of beta-turns resulted in the increase in beta-sheets. The microstructures of SPI and 11S gels were similar, being denser and more ordered than 7S gel. The low concentration of NaCl solution (0.2mol/L) enhanced gel properties and intermolecular forces, promoting the formation of SPI gel, whereas a high concentration (0.4-0.8mol/L) had a significant inhibitory effect. Urea and SDS solutions substantially inhibited the formation of SPI gel, leading to significant decreases in the water holding capacity and hardness as well as a considerable increase in the coagulation time (p<.05). The results revealed that hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions were the main intermolecular forces responsible for the gel formation. This study provides adequate technical support and a theoretical basis for soybean protein gel products. © 2022 The Authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The quality change and deterioration mechanism of leisure dried tofu (LD-tofu) were investigated during storage at 4 °C, 25 °C, and 37 °C for 150 d. The results indicated the protein content, fat content, carbohydrate content, and pH of LD-tofu significantly decreased, while the total viable counts and moisture content increased with a bigger storage time. Moreover, the hardness and springiness of LD-tofu stored at 4 °C and 37 °C for 150 d were 2.43 N and 0.932, as well as 1.44 N and 0.842, respectively. Insights from low-field nuclear magnetic resonance measurements revealed that the bound water in the LD-tofu could be transformed into free water, whereas the free water mobility increased significantly at 25 °C and 37 °C. Additionally, the peroxide value and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances level of LD-tofu stored at 25 °C and 37 °C increased, indicating that the high-temperature storage promoted lipid oxidation. Overall, concrete pieces of evidence were provided for the deterioration in the quality of LD-tofu under high-temperature storage due to changes to the protein gel network structure caused by protein oxidation, induced by lipid oxidation. This work paves the way for the development of reasonable storage programs for LD-tofu.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The diverse and complex processing technologies used to produce tofu leads to the production of tofu with varying yield, quality, and flavour characteristics. In this study, tofu was produced using the gel-forming principle of soybean protein coagulation of fermented soybean whey (FSW), the filtering-to-boiling method (FBM), boiling-to-filtering method (BFM), and repeated boiling-to-filtering method (RBFM). An evaluation of sensory attributes, physicochemical properties, textural characteristics, microstructure, isoflavones, and flavour components of tofu was conducted. The RBFM group exhibited the highest yield (255.34%), water holding capacity (73.42%), and protein content (19.12%). The BFM and RBFM tofu outperformed the FBM tofu in terms of textural characteristics, microstructure, and sensory traits. The tofu yield positively correlated with protein content, WHC, and hardness (r=0.902, 0.879, and 0.878, respectively). Compared to FBM, the content of aglycone isoflavones (daidzein, glycitin, genistein) and beany flavour components (1-hexanol, (E)-2-hexenol) in BFM and RBFM tofu were significantly higher (P< 0.05), while beta-glucosides isoflavones (daidzin, glycitin, genistein) and n-hexanal were significantly lower (P< 0.05). Overall, tofu made by the RBFM method yielded the highest quality products. The goal of this study was to provide a theoretical basis and offer technical support for the production of commercial-grade tofu.

J		Zhanzhi Liu; Jun Liu; Liqiong Ren; Jing Wu; Sheng Chen							Preparation of high-quality resistant dextrin through pyrodextrin by a multienzyme complex.		Food Bioscience					As a soluble food raw material with a low calorie content, resistant dextrin (RD) has broad application prospects in the food industry. Branching enzymes (BEs), as a key enzyme for RD preparation, can break the alpha-1,4 glycosidic bonds of donor chains and reconstruct the cleaved chains to acceptor chains through the alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds. BEs with high transglucosidic activity toward amylopectin and short-chain substrates are urgently needed to increase the quality of RD. Herein, BE derived from Thermuobifida fusca (TfBE) was mined and characterized. The optimal temperature and pH of the TfBE were 40 °C and 6.5, respectively. A total of 1500 U/g substrateTfBE reacted with 20% (w/v) pyrodextrin for 12 h, the ratio of alpha-1,4 to alpha-1,6 glycosidic bonds was changed from 3.52:1 to 2.33:1, and the content of enzyme-resistant components notably increased from 44.0% to 53.8%. Furthermore, to make full use of receptor chains and small molecular sugars in the reaction system, a multienzyme complex of TfBE with T. fusca alpha-cyclodextrin glucosyltransferase (TfCGTase), TfBE with TfCGTase and Aspergillus nidulans alpha-glucosidase (AnGS) was used to further increase the enzyme resistance of RD from 44.0% to 65.3% and 70.6%, respectively. The developed multienzyme complex method could effectively contribute to improving the production quality and efficiency of RD preparation.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					As a natural sweetener with low calories and various physiological activities, D-allulose has drawn worldwide attention. Currently, D-allulose 3-epimerase (DAEase) is mainly used to catalyze the epimerization of d-fructose to D-allulose. Therefore, it is quite necessary to enhance the food-grade expression of DAEase to meet the surging market demand for D-allulose. In this study, initially, the promising variant H207L/D281G/C289R of Clostridium cellulolyticum H10 DAEase (CcDAEase) was generated by protein engineering, the specific activity and the T1/2 of which were 2.24-fold and 13.45-fold those of the CcDAEase wild type at 60°C, respectively. After that, P amyE was determined as the optimal promoter for the recombinant expression of CcDAEase in Bacillus subtilis, and catabolite-responsive element (CRE) box engineering was further performed to eliminate the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) effect. Lastly, high-density fermentation was carried out and the final activity peaked at 4971.5 U mL-1, which is the highest expression level and could effectively promote the industrial production of DAEase. This research provides a theoretical basis and technical support for the molecular modification of DAEase and its efficient fermentation preparation.										2022	70	38	12128	12134	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04800					FSTA:2023-02-Tb0488
J		Zhao, D.; Rounds, E.; Zhu, K.; Incledon, M.							Responses of sugarcane yield components to harvest dates for cultivars with different flowering characters.		International Sugar Journal					Better understanding of sugarcane yield components for different cultivars with diverse flowering characters as affected by harvest date can improve variety development programs and production profitability. A field study was conducted at the USDA-ARS Sugarcane Field Station in 2018-2021 to determine effects of harvest date on yield components for eight cultivars with different flowering behaviors. These cultivars could be grouped early flowering (CP96-1252, HoCP96-540, CP11-1314), late flowering (CP89-2143, CP05-1526, CP11-2248), and no flowering (CP00-1101, CP01-1372). The experiment was a complete random block design with three replications. Millable stalks were counted in August and 10-stalk samples were collected in each plot monthly from mid-October through February in plant cane and two ratoon crops. These stalk samples were weighed and milled to determine cane fiber, juice Brix, and POL for estimating yield components and their responses to harvest date. Cultivar, crop cycle, and harvest date significantly affected most yield components of stalk population, stalk weight, commercial recoverable sucrose (CRS), and cane yield (TCH). Among eight cultivars, CP01-1372 and CP11-1314 had highest, while CP96-1252, CP89-2143, and CP001101 had lowest sucrose yield. Both TCH and CRS followed the polynomial trends with harvest date. Early flowering cultivars had higher TCH and lower CRS as compared with no-flowering cultivars. The differences among the three flowering groups in TSH were smaller than that in TCH. Results from this study can be used to improve knowledge of maturity curves and to optimize harvest date for juice quality and TSH.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Riclin is a typical succinoglycan produced by an agrobacterium isolate. Our previous investigation has revealed that oral riclin restores the islet function in type 1 diabetic mice. However, whether dietary riclin improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is unknown. Here, we found that dietary riclin (20 and 40 mg/kg) for 4 weeks significantly decreased fasting blood glucose (55 and 67%), improved insulin sensitivity, and decreased insulin resistance in high-fat-diet/streptozocin (HFD/STZ)-induced T2D. Riclin reduced the proportion of T helper 1 cell subsets in diabetic mice, alleviated pancreatic inflammation, and protected islet function. Moreover, dietary riclin enriched the diversity of gut microflora and restored the relative abundance of several bacterial genera in diabetes, including the strains of Clostridium, Parasutterella, Klebsiella, and Bacteroides. In db/db diabetic mice, riclin also improves glycemia control as observed in HFD/STZ-induced T2D mice. These data suggest that riclin has potential to be a functional food to treat T2D.										2022	70	6	1819	1829	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06881					FSTA:2022-11-Ge5307

Site-directed mutation of beta-galactosidase from Streptococcus thermophilus for galactooligosaccharide-enriched yogurt making.		Journal of Dairy Science					beta-Galactosidase is one of the most important enzymes used in dairy processing. It converts lactose into glucose and galactose, and also catalyzes galactose to form galactooligosaccharides (GOS), so-called prebiotics. However, most of the beta-galactosidases from the starter cultures have low transgalactosylation activities, the process that results in galactose accumulation in yogurt. Here, a site-directed mutation strategy was attempted, to genetically modify beta-galactosidase from Streptococcus thermophilus. Out of 28 Strep. thermophilus strains, a beta-galactosidase gene named bgaQ, encoded for high beta-galactosidase hydrolysis activity (BgaQ), was cloned from the strain Strep. thermophilus SDMCC050237. It was 3,081 bp in size, with 1,027 deduced amino acid residuals, which belonged to the GH2 family. After replacing the Tyr801 and Pro802 around the active sites of BgaQ with His801 and Gly802, the GOS synthesis of the generated mutant protein BgaQ-8012 increased from 20.5% to 26.7% at 5% lactose, and no hydrolysis activity altered obviously. Subsequently, the purified BgaQ or BgaQ-8012 was added to sterilized milk inoculated with 2 starters from Strep. thermophilus SDMCC050237 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus ATCC11842. The GOS yields with added BgaQ or BgaQ-8012 increased to 5.8 and 8.3 g/L, respectively, compared with a yield of 3.7 g/L without enzymes added. Meanwhile, the addition of the BgaQ or BgaQ-8012 reduced the lactose content by 49.3% and 54.4% in the fermented yogurt and shortened the curd time. Therefore, this study provided a site-directed mutation strategy for improvement of the transgalactosylation activity of beta-galactosidase from Strep. thermophilus for GOS-enriched yogurt making.

Journal of Cereal Science					The unconventional processing of grain ingredients in the craft brewing industry changes the production of brewers' spent grain (BSG) byproducts. This study aimed to investigate the nutritional composition of representative BSG samples obtained from craft breweries in the region of North Dakota and Minnesota in the United States. Whole grain/malt kernels and large fragments were observed in all craft BSG samples which consisted of 38.2% fiber, 33.1% starch, 18.7% protein, 6.3% lipid, and 3.2% ash (dry basis) on average. The limited sparging in the craft industrial processing retained significant amounts of fermentable sugars and free amino acids in the craft BSGs. Fermentable sugars, including maltose, maltotriose, glucose, and fructose, were detected at the total level of 8.25.8% in BSG dry basis. Free amino acids in the craft BSGs were at the total level of 2571.7940.6 mg/kg, with 40% being essential amino acids. Phenolic acids, mainly including ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, sinapic acid, and vanillic acid were at the total level of 2309.7344.0 mg/kg, which primarily existed in the insoluble bound form. The total content of nutritional minerals in the craft BSGs was 1.00.2%. The results highlighted that large amounts of starch, fermentable sugars, and free amino acids still remained in the BSGs from craft brewing operations, which should be further exploited.

J.; Cao Chongjiang; Yuan Biao							Investigation of the interactions between food plant carbohydrates and titanium dioxide nanoparticles.		Food Research International					Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is commonly used as food whitening in candies, chocolates, and cakes with high carbohydrate contents. The potential interaction between the food carbohydrate and food grade TiO2 nanoparticle was little known. Therefore, we explored the interaction between TiO2 nanoparticles and seven common carbohydrates, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides. The result showed that all the carbohydrates tested interacted with the surfaces of the TiO2 nanoparticles and formed biocoronas. TEM and SEM images provided information about the morphology formation of biocoronas. The surface potential and size of the TiO2 nanoparticles altered after interacting with the carbohydrates. FTIR spectroscopy and QCM-D findings showed insights into the molecular origin and nature interaction between TiO2 and carbohydrates. The results illustrated that TiO2 nanoparticles can interact with carbohydrates, enter the body as a food additive, and interact with food matrix for a series of reactions. Compared with monosaccharides or disaccharides, food polysaccharides have stronger adsorption on the surface of nanoparticles. This is a preliminary judgment for the subsequent in vitro simulated digestion. Our result could be useful for understanding and controlling the behavior of nanoparticles in food and the human gut.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Perinatal high-fat diet (HFD) increases risk of metabolic disorders in offspring. Adipose tissue remodeling is associated with metabolic syndrome. The current study characterizes the profile of maternal HFD-induced changes in adipose tissue remodeling and adipokines expression in mice offspring. Methods and Results. Female C57BL/6 mice are fed with CHOW or HFD for 2 weeks before mating, throughout gestation and lactation. At weaning, pups are randomly fed with CHOW or HFD, resulting in eight groups according to sex and maternal diet: Male CHOW-CHOW (MCC), Male CHOW-HFD (MCH), Male HFD-CHOW (MHC), Male HFD-HFD (MHH), Female CHOW-CHOW (FCC), Female CHOW-HFD (FCH), Female HFD-CHOW (FHC), and Female HFD-HFD (FHH). Increased body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, increased adipose tissue mass and hypertrophy, and decreased circulating asprosin level are only observed in male offspring exposure to maternal HFD. Serum asprosin level negatively correlates with fasting blood glucose, serum cholesterol (CHO), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, while positively correlates with serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) levels in male offspring. A combination of genetic and biochemical analyses of adipokines shows the depot-and sex-specific changes in response to maternal and/or post-weaning HFD. Conclusion. This study's results reveal the differential metabolic changes in response to maternal and/or post-weaning HFD in male and female offspring. The effect of maternal HFD on metabolic phonotype is more obvious in male offspring, supporting the notion that males are more susceptible to HFD-induced metabolic disorders. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	4			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100470					FSTA:2022-06-Aj9963

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					As a healthy and excellent protein source, oyster has often been used for discovering peptides with diverse bioactivities via enzymatic hydrolysis. However, this procedure is time consuming and laborious. Instead, an in silico digestion process of oyster proteins was adopted in this study to simulate their digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, after which bioactivity analysis was conducted on the digest. By in silico digestion of myosin heavy chain (MHC), actin, and paramyosin of the oyster Crassostrea gigas, seventeen peptides with potential research value were identified based on the PeptideRanker score and their physical and chemical properties. ADMET analysis and bioactivity prediction revealed that 12 polypeptides had angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, whereas 9 polypeptides had dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity. Evaluation of the above 12 and 9 polypeptides suggested MMDF (Met-Met-Asp-Phe) and MR (Met-Arg) to have the highest predicted inhibitory activity as an ACE and DPP-IV inhibitor, respectively. Moreover, molecular docking studies showed that MMDF and MR could form stable complexes with ACE and DPP-IV proteins, respectively, with the CDOCKER energy of - 88.39 and - 76.50 kcal/mol, respectively. This study highlights the possible mechanism of the glycemia-lowering and antihypertensive activity of the oyster, and confirms the advantages of such in silico methods. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative disease. Oxidative stress (OS) modulates OA pathogenesis by enhancing chondrocyte apoptosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration via activation of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Prior studies revealed that safranal plays a critical role in multiple diseases treatments, but there are no reports on its effect on OA. Therefore, investigating the effect of safranal on OA is needed. As a compound that can lead excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) was used to induce OS and OS-mediated endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress for imitating OA in vitro. Besides, the bilateral medial meniscus was removed to induce joint instability and excessive friction of the joint surface to establish destabilization of medial meniscus for imitating the initiation and progression of OA in vivo. We, next, conducted Western blot and RT-PCR analyses to identify biomarkers of the underlying signaling pathway. Our results demonstrated that 30 muM safranal strongly upregulated Sirt1 expression, suppressed TBHP-mediated ER stress, and, in turn, prevented chondrocyte apoptosis and ECM degeneration. Furthermore, compared with the other two classic signaling pathways of ER stress, safranal can inhibit the PERK-eIF2alpha-CHOP axis at the lower concentration (5 and 15 muM). In vivo, using Safranin O staining, X-ray, immunofluorescence (IF), and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, we demonstrated that OA progression can be postponed with intraperitoneal injection of 90 and 180 mg/kg safranal in an OA mouse model. Taken together, our analyses revealed that safranal can potentially prevent OA development.										2022	70	31	9748	9759	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01773					FSTA:2022-12-Aj23392

The impact of expectation discrepancy on food consumers' quality perception and purchase intentions: exploring mediating and moderating influences in China.		Food Control					The discrepancy between expected and actual food product features can be an important indicator of food quality and thus may inform consumer decisions. Using mixed method design, this paper explores whether and how expectation discrepancy affects food consumers' quality perception and purchase intentions under food safety risk situation. In the first phase, a qualitative study based on in-depth semi structured interviews (N = 15) was conducted. The interview results revealed that consumers in general responded negatively towards the existence of expectation discrepancies as it led to poor perceived food quality. It was further revealed that the discrepancy in expectation dimensions had a stronger effect on consumers' perceptions as compared to the discrepancy in expectation extent. In the second phase extensive online survey (N = 2172), it was confirmed that expectation discrepancy had significantly affected quality perceptions and purchase intentions. Moreover, perceived quality played a mediating role between expectation discrepancy and purchase intentions. In addition, expectation proportion (measured with the importance of specific food feature) was shown to strengthen (moderate) the impact of expectation discrepancy. Furthermore, the effects of expectation discrepancy were stronger for high-risk food (versus low risk food). The current paper shows that the effects of expectation discrepancy play a highly significant role in forming perceptions about food safety, therefore, precise marketing strategies can be made by clustering consumers according to the expectation proportions.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Toona sinensis (TS) shoot is a seasonal and quick deteriorating vegetable with unique alliaceous flavour. In this study, corn oil was used to concentrate the sulphur-containing compounds responsible for the unique TS flavour with and without aqueous dispersion. The level of sulphur-containing compounds in TS shoots was 0.32mugg-1 and concentrated to 2.34mugg-1 in the corn oil with aqueous dispersion. The sulphur-containing compounds, trans-2-Mercapto-3,4-dimethyl-2,3-dihydrothiophene and (E, Z)-Di-1-propenyldisulphide, were identified in the corn oil, while they were not detected in the oil without aqueous dispersion. Based on sensory and electronic nose analysis, the aroma of corn oil with aqueous medium extraction had stronger alliaceous aroma than TS shoots and the extraction corn oil without aqueous dispersion. With aqueous dispersion assistance, the sulphur-containing aroma compounds in TS shoots were effectively concentrated in corn oil. The flavour-enriched oil could serve as a flavour ingredient to deliver TS shoots aroma for different food applications. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	3	1644	1653	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15526					FSTA:2022-06-Ne1230

Foods					Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy is a nondestructive, rapid, real-time analysis of technical detection methods with an important reference value for producers and consumers. In this study, the feasibility of using FT-NIR spectroscopy for the rapid quantitative analysis and qualitative analysis of "Zaosu" and "Dangshansuli" pears is explored. The quantitative model was established by partial least squares (PLS) regression combined with cross-validation based on the spectral data of 340 pear fresh fruits and synchronized with the reference values determined by conventional assays. Furthermore, NIR spectroscopy combined with cluster analysis was used to identify varieties of "Zaosu" and "Dangshansuli". As a result, the model developed using FT-NIR spectroscopy gave the best results for the prediction models of soluble solid content (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA) of "Dangshansuli" (residual prediction deviation, RPD: 3.272 and 2.239), which were better than those developed for "Zaosu" SSC and TA modeling (RPD: 1.407 and 1.471). The results also showed that the variety identification of "Zaosu" and "Dangshansuli" could be carried out based on FT-NIR spectroscopy, and the discrimination accuracy was 100%. Overall, FT-NIR spectroscopy is a good tool for rapid and nondestructive analysis of the internal quality and variety identification of fresh pears. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Control					The adulteration of edible vegetable oil is simple, but the detection is difficult, so it is a common target for fraudsters. To gain insight into the fraud vulnerability of the edible vegetable oil supply chain and then take more targeted measures to prevent and mitigate food fraud, we assessed the perceived fraud vulnerability of Chinese enterprises using the SSAFE food fraud vulnerability assessment (FFVA) tool and further applied multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U test & Kruskal-Wallis test) to compare the differences in fraud vulnerability between tier groups. Food fraud vulnerability in the FFVA questionnaire consists of three key elements: opportunities, motivations, and control measures. The results show that (1) Fraud factors related to opportunities in the Chinese edible vegetable oil supply chain have an overall medium-high vulnerability, while those related to motivations and control measures have medium and low vulnerability, respectively. Producers have significantly higher perceived fraud vulnerability in terms of opportunities and motivations than retailers. In the comparison between companies and workshops of producers, the perceived fraud vulnerability was significantly higher for workshops in terms of motivations and control measures and higher for companies in terms of opportunities, indicating that workshops are more vulnerable to committing fraud driven by economics and business culture and that they lack adequate measures to control fraud, in addition to the perception by companies that they are more likely to be victims of fraud. The perceived vulnerability to fraud varies by the scale of enterprises. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	138				0956-7135				10.1016/j.foodcont.2022.109005					FSTA:2022-09-Ne1972

Foods					The aim of this work is to glazing a modified bio-polymer shell as substitute of peel to keep the postharvest quality of fresh-cut fruits. In this study, chitosan as backbone of the shell was modified by addition of the functional extracts obtained from Zanthoxylum, in which 12 kinds of main identified bio-active components consisted of over 55% of the total extracts. The introduction of the extracts improved physic and mechanical properties of the shell, and endowed it with significant antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Accordingly, the modified chitosan was used as the substitute of peel to preserve fresh-cut apples. Results exhibited that such treatments obviously delayed the decline process of overall postharvest quality of the preserved apple samples throughout all the storage period, represented by the variations in physical, chemical, and microbial properties of the apple samples were significantly inhibited. The overall observations revealed promising potential of the bio-polymer shell in food application. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhaojuan Shi; Lili Cao; Shengmei Kang; Shaotong Jiang; Min Pang							Influence of wax type on characteristics of oleogels from camellia oil and medium chain triglycerides.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Camellia oil (CO) and medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), characterised by different carbon chain lengths, were gelled using beeswax (BW), candelilla wax (CLW) and carnauba wax (CRW). Critical concentrations, oil-binding capacity (OBC), textural parameters, thermal properties, microscopic properties and infrared spectra were used to evaluate their differences. The carbon chain length of oil sources showed different results for the critical concentration of the three wax-based gel oils at 25°C, and the oleogel of MCT and CLW exhibited a minimum value (1%). The oleogels formed from CO and waxes with wax esters as the main components (BW and CRW) exhibit significantly lower OBC and textural value than the oleogels made from MCT with BW and CRW. Meanwhile, this is corroborated with the thermal behaviour and crystal morphology, and distribution of the oleogels. However, no differences in crystal types and generation of new functional groups were observed by X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer, suggesting that the differences in the properties of wax-based oleogels with different carbon chain lengths are attributed to the interactions between the waxes and the oil sources (physical interaction). © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	4	2003	2014	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15344					FSTA:2022-07-Ae11031
J		Zhaojun Peng; Yuhong Jin							Effect of an endo-1,4-beta-xylanase from wheat malt on water-unextractable arabinoxylan derived from wheat.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Non-starch polysaccharides in wheat are dominated by arabinoxylan (AX). Endo-1,4-beta-xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) is the most important enzyme for degrading AX. This paper investigated the ability of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase extracted from wheat malt to degrade non-water-extractable wheat-derived arabinoxylan (WUAX). Results. The enzyme was observed to break down wheat-derived WUAX effectively, substantially increasing the concentration of water-extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) in the system for up to 6h. A considerable quantity of arabinose xylooligosaccharide (AXOS) was also produced, suggesting that the enzyme could produce oligosaccharides too. The molecular weight of the product WEAX was between 23 and 27kDa and the content of oligosaccharides changed with degradation time. This suggests that endo-1,4-beta-xylanase can not only degrade WUAX into WEAX and xylooligosaccharides but can also degrade the xylooligosaccharides with larger molecular weights into xylobiose and xylotriose. The viscosity of the degradation product increased significantly in the first 2h, then decreased with longer degradation times. The concentration of WEAX in the reaction system increased throughout the reaction but at gradually lower rates, indicating that the endo-1,4-beta-xylanase degraded WEAX better than it degraded WUAX. Rheological tests showed that solutions prepared from the WEAX that was produced had properties of a pseudoplastic fluid. Conclusion. The results showed that the wheat malt endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, which we had previously tested on WEAX, was also effective in degrading wheat-derived WUAX. This study can therefore provide a theoretical basis for the subsequent role of the enzyme in other sources of xylan, and provide guidance for the quality control of beer in the brewing process. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	5	1912	1918	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11528					FSTA:2022-06-Hc5596

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aims to reduce beany flavors and gain new aromatic flavors of okara by using edible fungi. Four edible fungi (Wolfiporia cocos CGMCC 5.55, Wolfiporia cocos CGMCC 5.528, Wolfiporia Cocos CGMCC 5.78 and Tremella fuciformis CGMCC 5.466) were chosen to ferment okara. The volatile compounds in original and fermented okara were investigated by head space-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/olfactometry. Before fermentation, 13 off-flavor compounds were detected in the okara. Hexanal and cis-6-nonenal were the main off-flavor substances with a relative content of 54.31% and 1.64%, respectively. After fermentation, the content of off-flavor compounds decreased, and new aromatic compounds were generated. The relative content of hexanal decreased to 0.37%, and cis-6-nonenal was not detected. After fermentation with Wolfiporia cocos CGMCC 5.528, phenethyl alcohol and linalool were generated (182.07 mug/L and 83.23 mug/L, respectively). All fermented products had very little characteristics of beany flavor. In conclusion, the use of edible fungi, especially Wolfiporia cocos CGMCC 5.528, can provide an effective and sustainable way to reduce the beany flavor and improve the flavor quality of okara.

J		Zhaojun Zheng; Jiaxin Li; Yin Chen; Hong Sun; Yuanfa Liu							Preparation and characterization of lipophilic antioxidative peptides derived from mung bean protein.		Food Chemistry					This study aimed to prepare and characterize antioxidative hydrolysate and its lipophilic peptides derived from mung bean protein. Our results indicated that the hydrolysate prepared with 120min hydrolysis (MPH) possessed superb DPPH, ABTS radical scavenging activity and metal ion-chelating activity with IC50 values of 11.19 0.02, 18.06 0.18 and 3.78 0.59 g/mL, respectively. MPH could also effectively retard lipid oxidation for oil-in-water emulsion (up to 50%) and linoleic acid (up to 94%), as well as for bulk oil. Interestingly, the lipophilic peptide fraction (MPHP) extracted from MPH could suppress the formation of primary (up to 50%) and secondary oxidation products (up to 90%) in bulk oil. Ten lipophilic peptides identified from MPHP using LC-MS/MS possessed high amounts of hydrophobic amino acids and histidine, which might favor peptides interacting and/or forming hydrogen bonds with lipid radicals. These findings provide a new perspective for lipophilic peptides in fortifying lipids as natural antioxidants.

J		Zhaolei Ma; Lijia Li; Changling Wu; Yuyang Huang; Fei Teng; Yang Li							Effects of combined enzymatic and ultrasonic treatments on the structure and gel properties of soybean protein isolate.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effects of combined treatment of enzyme and ultrasound on the structure of soybean protein isolate (SPI) and the properties of SPI gel cross-linked with glutamine transaminase (TG). The papain-hydrolyzed SPI with hydrolysis degrees of about 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1.0% was treated with ultrasound (300 W, 20 min) to obtain different modified proteins. The sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of SPI after combined treatment showed lower molecular weight, indicating dissociation of some subunits into smaller units. In addition, the protein structure extended, promoting the exposure of free sulfhydryl and hydrophobic groups. Compared with untreated SPI, the SPI gel prepared by the combined treatment formed a uniform and dense gel network, and its gel strength and water-holding capacity (WHC) significantly improved. The gel strength and WHC were higher in the SPI gel treated with a combination of ultrasound and enzyme than that treated with ultrasound or enzyme alone, exhibiting the synergistic effect of enzymatic and ultrasonic treatment. In conclusion, the combined treatment of enzyme and ultrasound might be an effective way of improving the structure and gel properties of SPI.

Food Chemistry					Bacterial contamination is a significant concern in food safety. Traditional methods, though being a gold standard for bacterial detection, are time-consuming. In this work, we managed to establish a simple and versatile magnetic-assisted microfluidic method for rapid bacterial detection of fish muscle products, by manipulating anti-human IgG functionalized magnetic beads in a zig-zag shaped microfluidic channel, increasing the probability for bacteria capture. The captured bacteria were characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). This method is capable of isolating Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae from 5muL of sablefish sarcoplasmic protein sample, and detecting Escherichia coli in the range of 6.0 to 6.0 * 104 CFU/mL with a detection limit of 6 CFU/mL. Bacterial growth on salmon sashimi during its period of storage was successfully monitored. The current protocol holds great potential for pathogen detection and microbial control in the food industry.

J		Zhaolin Song; Miaomiao Li; Jinhua Du; Kaili Zhang							Effects of non-starch polysaccharides from pure wheat malt beer on beer quality, in vitro antioxidant, prebiotics, hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic properties.		Food Bioscience					Pure wheat malt beer (PWMB) with potentially functional properties may attract consumer interest. To explore the functional properties of non-starch polysaccharides (NSPs) in PWMB, NSPs were extracted from PWMB and separated into PWMB non-starch polysaccharides-1 (PNSP-1) and PWMB non-starch polysaccharides-2 (PNSP-2) by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column. PNSP-1 exhibited more effects on increasing the viscosity of beers, which had higher purity of 92.58% containing 88.53% arabinoxylan with arabinose/xylose (A/X) 0.60 and 2.78% beta-glucan but no glucomannan and mannan; while PNSP-2 showed greater effects on promoting beer haze and foam retention, which had more diverse NSPs including 46.03% arabinoxylan with A/X 1.13, 41.47% arabinogalactan, 10.26% glucomannan, and 2.70% mannan but no beta-glucan. Diversity of sugar composition resulted in a better antioxidant capacity of PNSP-2. NSPs proliferated Lactobacillus casei LC6117 and LC0331, but did not promote L. plantarum LP-28 and L. fermentium LF-2H. PNSP-2 was also utilized by L. rhamnosus SRG. PNSP-2 had better effects on prebiotics activities. PNSP, PNSP-1 and PNSP-2 all exhibited mild inhibitory effects on alpha-glucosidase and lipase but not on alpha-amylase, and showed a binding capacity to fat and cholesterol. This work is of great reference significance for improving the viscosity, haze, foam retention and health value of wheat beer.

J		Zhaolong Liu; Tianyang Xu; Jinhui Zhou; Lanzhen Chen							Application of stable isotopic and elemental composition combined with random forest algorithm for the botanical classification of Chinese honey.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					To ensure that honey belongs to a very appreciated botanical class, the classical methodology is melissopalynology analysis to identify and count pollen grains. However, this method is time-consuming and laborious. In this work, four stable isotopes (delta13Ch, delta13Cp, delta18O and delta2H) and twelve elemental contents (Na, Mg, Ca, K, Fe, Cr, Mn, Co, Cu, Sr, Se, Mo) were used to build the dataset, and the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) were investigated to classify six varieties of Chinese honey (linden, sunflower, vetch, rape, acacia, and jujube). The results showed the RF algorithm exhibits the highest training accuracy (99.4%) and testing accuracy (96.5%) of the four algorithms. Hence, the RF algorithm was selected to rank the 16 attributes according to their contribution, and delta2H, Sr, delta18O, Mn, Ca, and K were considered the most important factors for identifying six varieties of honey. Furthermore, the results of the RF algorithm were verified by the parallel coordinates plot. This suggests that the RF algorithm provides an effective and accurate approach for classifying Chinese honey according to stable isotopic and elemental composition, which theoretically can be used to classify more types of honey.

Food Chemistry					Pomelo volatile organic compounds (PVOCs) are used as food additives to provide unique flavors, thus, and the possible effects of VOC binding to albumin should be considered. Headspace solid-phase microextraction with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to fingerprints adsorption of PVOCs on human serum albumin (HSA). Spectral data and molecular modeling were used to establish a binding model between PVOCs and HSA. Twenty-one common components were identified, and dipentene, linalylacetate, and nootkatone were identified as characteristic components. Thermodynamic calculations showed that dipentene and linalylacetate bound to HSA via van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions, whereas nootkatone bound to HSA via van der Waals forces alone. Molecular modeling showed that the volatile components were all bound to the hydrophobic pocket of HSA site I. Our results provide a useful basis for quality evaluation of pomelo and explain the mechanism of interaction between PVOCs and HSA.

Food Research International					This work investigated the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) - generating systems on the softening of the pale, soft and exudative-like (PSE-like) rabbit meat during aging. PSE-like meat was induced by incubation of post-mortem rabbit Longissimus thoracis et lumborum at 37 °C for 3 h. During aging, PSE-like meat samples had higher values in peroxides value, thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, metmyoglobin percentage, ferrylmyoglobin content, non-heme iron content, hydroxyl radical content and ROS concentration compared with the normal ones, suggesting that PSE-like incubation could activate lipid-oxidizing system, myoglobin-mediated oxidation system, together with metal-catalyzed oxidation system. Additionally, higher protein carbonyl content was observed in PSE-like meat, along with a significant loss in sulfhydryl group. The results of SDS-PAGE suggested that more serious protein degradation occurred in PSE-like meat. It is plausible that the activated ROS-generating system played an underlying role in the softening texture during the aging period of PSE-like meat.

Food & Function					The fruits of Garcinia bracteata can be eaten raw or processed into spices, which are considered to possess nutritional and medicinal value. Neobractatin (NBT) is a natural compound isolated from Garcinia bracteate. This study showed that NBT showed antitumor effect by upregulation of CELF6. CELF6, an RNA-binding protein of the CELF family, is involved in cancer cell proliferation. However, the role of CELF6 in human cervical cancer remains unknown. Here, we showed that CELF6 overexpression significantly suppressed HeLa cell proliferation. Mechanistically, the RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (RIP-seq) results suggested that CELF6 physically targeted the cyclin D1 transcript, affecting protein stability. Overexpression of CELF6 increased the degradation of cyclin D1. Consistent results were obtained for the effect of NBT, which increased the expression of CELF6 at both the mRNA and protein levels. An in vivo study further confirmed the regulatory effect of NBT on CELF6 and cyclin D1 levels in a HeLa xenograft model. Similar effects of NBT on CELF6 were also shown in K562 cells in vitro and in vivo. In conclusion, our findings identified CELF6 as a tumor suppressor and a novel therapeutic target in cervical cancer. The upregulation of CELF6 expression by NBT and its antiproliferative effect on HeLa cells indicated that NBT from G. bracteata might be a small-molecule compound targeting CELF6. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	4	1741	1750	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03542h					FSTA:2022-06-Te2064

Food & Function					The purpose of this paper was to extract and characterize type II collagen of sturgeon cartilage (SC-CII), and to explore the effects of taking SC-CII orally on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in rats. SC-CII showed a triple-helix structure (RPN = 0.12), with d1 of 11.82 A and d2 of 4.08 A, which was analyzed by FT-IR, CD, XRD, and MS. It was constructed of the repeating tripeptide unit Gly-X-Y, where X and Y are generally Pro or Hyp, proved by amino acid composition and peptide mass fingerprinting. Furthermore, the effects of SC-CII on RA were evaluated. Ankle thickness was significantly decreased in SC-CII groups, with changes in lymphocyte proliferation also observed. Compared with the model control group, there was an evident decrease in TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, COX-2, MCP-1, and TLR-4mRNA levels, but no remarkable differences in APF, MMP-3, and MyD88mRNA levels in the SC-CII groups. In addition, TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, RF, Anti-CII Ab were significantly reduced in the SC-CII groups, proved by ELISA. Therefore, SC-CII showed alleviating effects on RA through the TLR4/MyD88-NFkappaB pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	11	6152	6165	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03929f					FSTA:2022-10-Rc4053

European Food Research and Technology					Vineyard row orientation is a major factor that determines the canopy microclimate. Different vineyard row orientations have been adopted to maximize terroir potential. Little is known about the impact of row orientation on the microclimatic, physicochemical, and aroma attributes of grapes in high-altitude arid valleys. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of vineyard row orientation (north-south and east-west) in the high-altitude arid valley regions on microclimate and grape chemical components in high-altitude arid valley regions. To this end, two vineyards were selected, and both vineyards adopted a north-south and east-west row orientation. The results showed that in the two vineyards, the row orientation changed the canopy microclimate, including soil temperature, canopy temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation, as well as the phenolic compounds, individual anthocyanins, and volatile compounds of grapes. In terms of the microclimate, the north-south row orientation promoted balanced photosynthetic performance and temperature between the two sides. Grapes from the north-south oriented rows presented higher reducing sugar and lower titratable acidity during berry ripening. Grapes from east-west oriented rows demonstrated a better association with volatile variables. The north-south orientation was proven to be favorable for balancing the gap between technological, phenolic, and aromatic maturity. This information will be useful for vineyard establishment and integrated management, and it will provide more strategies for exploring distinctive tastes and structures in wines from arid valley regions. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	5	1365	1378	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-03961-9					FSTA:2022-07-Hj6649
J		Zhaoxiang Wang; Ni Yang; Jiarui Zhang; Chunlong Yuan							Skin cell wall ripeness alters wine tannin profiles via modulating interaction with seed tannin during alcoholic fermentation.		Food Research International					The proportion of seed tannins in wine is higher than that of skin tannins during normal winemaking practices. The interaction between grape skin cell wall and seed tannin could alter seed tannin extraction and wine tannin profiles during winemaking. However, the influence of grape skin cell wall ripeness in the interaction is still unclear. The purpose of this work was to study the influence of grape skins cell wall ripeness on seed tannins extraction and the final wine tannin profiles during alcoholic fermentation. The percentage of seed tannins extraction increases according to the skin cell wall maturity, and the higher the mDP of tannins, the larger the difference of tannins extraction. During alcoholic fermentation, seed tannins are adsorbed to the skin cell wall and desorb gradually into wine. For the final wine, cell wall maturity was positively correlated with tannins concentration and negatively correlated with G%. The results indicate that grape skin cell walls of different ripeness modulate seed tannins profiles in wine by controlling seed tannins release and adsorption-desorption of tannins during alcoholic fermentation.

J		Zhaoxiang Wang; Jiahui Yang; Yamei Ren; Chunlong Yuan; Zhilei Wang							The effects of the grape varieties and the wine aging periods on the tannin profiles and the astringency perceptions of wines.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Tannins are the molecules that are responsible for the astringency perceptions of wines. However, the mechanisms by which tannins influence the astringency perceptions of wines remain unclear. In the current study, the grape varieties had greater effects on the tannin profiles than did the aging periods. The percentage of galloylated flavanols (%G) was positively correlated with drying astringency and negatively correlated with velvety astringency. The mean degree of polymerization (mDP) of tannins had a positive correlation with drying astringency. In comparison to monomeric flavan-3-ols, the flavan-3-ol subunits of tannins are the most important determinants of astringency perceptions. Furthermore, findings justified the inconsistencies on the correlation between the tannins profiles and the astringency reported of previous studies. The current findings enhance the understanding of the relationship between the tannin profiles and the astringency perceptions of wines.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Because of the continuous increase in global cheese consumption, there is a continual need to find new coagulants for producing cheeses with different characteristics to suit various consumers. A new coagulant was extracted from Tenebrio molitor larvae. We then investigated the influence of pH on the coagulation properties of Tenebrio molitor coagulant. The results indicate that the rennet flocculation time and whey OD value of Tenebrio molitor coagulant increased with the increase in coagulation pH (P<0.05). The water holding capacity, turbidity, particle size and storage modulus increased and then decreased (P<0.05) and reached the maximum at pH 5.6. There was a decrease and then increase for casein glycopeptide in the hydrolysis solution (P<0.05), and its content reached 0.64mg/mL at pH 6.2; the minimum hydrolysis of Tenebrio molitor coagulant was found at pH 5.6. SDS-PAGE, secondary structure and confocal laser scanning microscope indicated that the curd structure was stable at pH 5.6, and the coagulation performance was better. Moreover, there were the smallest differences for the texture structure of Tenebrio molitor coagulant curd with commercial rennet curd at pH 5.6.

J		Zhaoyang Song; Yinjuan Cao; Yan Zhang; Zhongming Zhang; Xixiong Shi; Weibing Zhang; Pengcheng Wen							Effects of storage methods on the microbial community and quality of Sichuan smoked bacon.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study examined the storage of smoked bacon. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing technology (SMRT) were used to quantitate volatile constituents and microbial communities. The results indicated that the quality of bacon and its volatile constituents at room temperature are higher than those stored at 4°C (P< 0.05). The bacterial abundance of smoked bacon in the H group that were hung from a beam at room temperature was higher than those of the L group, which were packaged under vacuum conditions and stored at 4°C. The fungal diversity was lower in the H group than in the L group. Staphylococcus equorum was the most prominent bacterial species in the two groups, while both the fungal species Candida zeylanoides and Debaryomyces prosopidis were in all groups of smoked bacon. Pearson correlation coefficients indicated that Staphylococcus equorum positively correlated with heptanal in both groups. Lactobacillus sakei was positively (P< 0.01) related to heptanal in refrigeration, and Debaryomyces prosopidis positively correlated with hexanal in both groups. This study should help to improve the quality of meat by mediating microbial communities in Sichuan smoked bacon.

J		Zhaoyuan He; Yawen Guo; Lan Chen; Kaizhou Xie; Yang Lu; Jinyuan Chen; Genxi Zhang; Tao Zhang; Guojun Dai							Development of a UPLC-FLD method for quantitative analysis of three tetracyclines and two fluoroquinolones in chicken muscle.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A sensitive, rapid and efficient ultra-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (UPLC-FLD) method was established for detecting tetracycline (TC), oxytetracycline (OTC), doxycycline (DOX), enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) residues in chicken muscle. Moreover, the fluorescence detector output signals were processed by dual-channel detection. The samples were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1 M citric acid containing 100mM magnesium chloride (1:1, V/V, adjusted the pH to 5.0 with ammonia) using liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) and purified by Oasis PRiME hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridges (60mg/3mL). The target compounds were separated on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (100mm * 2.1mm, 1.7mum) chromatographic column using a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile and 0.1 M malonic acid solution containing 50mM magnesium chloride hexahydrate, and the pH was adjusted to 5.5 by adding ammonia. The limits of detection (LODs) and limits of quantification (LOQs) of the five target compounds in chicken muscle were 0.1-13.1mug/kg and 0.4-39.4mug/kg, respectively. The recoveries of the five target compounds in chicken muscles were above 87.33 % when the spiked concentrations were at the LOQ, 0.5maximum residue limit (MRL), 1.0 MRL and 2.0 MRL. The intraday relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 4.91 %, and the interday RSDs were less than 5.13 %. Ultimately, this novel detection method was successfully applied to the quantitative analysis of TC, OTC, DOX, ENR and CIP in 20 commercial chicken samples from local supermarkets.

J		Zharare, G. E.; Akweni, A. L.; Mostert, M.; Opoku, A. R.							The potential of Strychnos madagascariensis (Poir.) as a source of vegetable oil.		Food Bioscience					A study was undertaken to quantify screw press-extractable oil in the seed coat of Strychnos madagascariensis (Poir.) fruits harvested from trees in the northern coastal plain of KwaZulu-Natal province of South Africa and to determine the physiochemical properties and fatty acid composition of the oil. The seed coat constituted 19.36% of the dry fruit biomass and contained w/w 42% oil. Thus, the oil yield of the dried fruit was approx. 8.13%. Monounsaturated oleic acid accounted for between ca. 70-73% of the total fatty acids in the Strychnos oil. Palmitic acid was present in amounts ranging between 15.05 and 16.27%. Also present, but in smaller amounts were cis linoleic acid (5.76-6.03%), stearic acid (1.64-4.65%), n3 linolenic acid (1.26-1.90%), and palmitoleic acid (1.10-1.65%). The oil contained trace amounts of arachidic acid (0.45-0.54%) and eicosenoic acid (approx. 0.325%). Vitamin E was present in appreciable amounts, mostly in the form of alpha-tocopherol (approx. 5.8-14.4 mg/100 g oil) and beta-tocotrienol (approx. 8.1-15.6 mg/100 g oil) homologues. The downside was that the oil had high acid values (161-181.32 mg KOH/g) and free fatty acid content (66-81 g oleic acid/100 g oil). There were 141 volatile compounds detected in the Strychnos oil, the most dominant of which were butyl-butyrate (20%), butyl hexanoate (8.2%) and glycerol (6.1-6.7%). Overall, the results indicate that Strychnos madagascariensis has potential as a source of vegetable oil. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Zhe Jia; Ru Song; Yan Xu; Xinyan Liu; Xiaoxia Zhang							Astaxanthin absorption modulated antioxidant enzyme activity and targeted specific metabolic pathways in rats.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Saponification contributed to an increase in the in vitro antioxidant activity of astaxanthin (Asta) extracts derived from Penaeus sinensis (Solenocera crassicornis) by-products. However, the influence of non-saponification (N-Asta) and saponification Asta (S-Asta) absorption on antioxidant activity in vivo was limited. The antioxidant properties of N-Asta and S-Asta were therefore compared in Sprague Dawley male rats after 6h and 12 of absorption using biochemistry assays combined with an untargeted metabonomics strategy. Results. Non-saponified Asta and S-Asta showed similar digestive properties in a stimulated gastrointestinal tract. Increased glutathione content and decreased malondialdehyde content were measured in the liver tissues of N-Asta and S-Asta treated rats after 12h of absorption. Absorption of N-Asta increased liver total superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase activity. Treatment with S-Asta up-regulated NAD (P) H: quinine oxidoreductase-1, and heme oxygenase-1 expression was associated with the nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2/antioxidant responsive element pathway at the end of 12h absorption. With partial least square-discriminant analysis and metabolite heatmap profiles, the S-Asta group was clearly separated from the N-Asta group. The S-Asta treatment also demonstrated stronger influences on plasma metabolites than the N-Asta treatment. Both N-Asta and S-Asta absorption showed critical roles in the regulation of specific metabolites, and 15 potential biomarkers were identified in eight key pathways to separate these experimental groups after 12h of absorption. However, an increased serotonin level was only detected in the S-Asta group after 12h absorption. Conclusion. Absorption of N-Asta and S-Asta induced different antioxidant effects in normal rats, which were associated with metabolite changes. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	15	7003	7016	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12062					FSTA:2023-02-Re0950
J		Zhe Li; Yi Sun; Haobo Jin; Qi Wang; Yongguo Jin; Xi Huang; Long Sheng							Improvement and mechanism of emulsifying properties of liquid egg yolk by ozonation technology.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study introduced a novel non-thermal approach to improve the emulsifying properties of liquid egg yolk by ozonation technology. The best emulsifying performance was obtained following 20 min of ozone treatment. The emulsification activity, emulsion stability, creaming index and emulsion capacity were significantly (P< 0.05) increased by 42.2%, 175.0%, 35.0% and 42.4%, respectively. The structural changes of egg yolk proteins were monitored by UV spectroscopy, endogenous fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and zeta potential to investigate the formation mechanisms of improved emulsifying properties. Results showed that the moderate ozonation treatment (≤20 min) exposed more interior hydrophobic groups of egg yolk proteins and increased protein flexibility. Micro-rheology results indicated that ozonation could significantly improve the viscoelasticity of egg yolk emulsions. Accordingly, the egg yolk emulsion droplets observed by microscopy appeared to be smaller and more uniformly distributed after moderate ozone treatment, which had a positive effect on the emulsifying properties.

J		Zhe Liu; Dehui Lin; Nan Li; Xingbin Yang							Characterization of konjac glucomannan-based active films loaded with thyme essential oil: effects of loading approaches.		Food Hydrocolloids					The aim of this study was to compare the characterization of konjac glucomannan (KGM)-based active films loaded with thyme essential oil (TEO) via different approaches. KGM-based active films were loaded with TEO via four approaches (Approach: TEO only, approach II: TEO and Tween 80, approach III: TEO and bacterial cellulose nanofibers/soy protein isolate (BCNs/SPI) composite colloidal particles, approach IV: TEO-loaded Pickering emulsions stabilized by BCNs/SPI composite colloidal particles), and the characterization of the corresponding four types (type, II, III, and IV) of active films were investigated. The results showed that the microstructures of type II and type IV films were smoother and more compact than those of type and III films. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of type III and type IV films was higher as compared with that of type and type II films. Moreover, the physical properties of KGM-based active films loading TEO via approaches II, III, and IV were improved. Especially, type IV film presented the most excellent properties among the four types of active films. Additionally, type IV film displayed the highest total phenol content and antioxidant capacities, as well as the best TEO-release property. Therefore, this study suggested that the TEO-loading approach via Pickering emulsions was the most effective way to improve the properties of the KGM-based active films.

Foods					Grain drying is a complex heat and mass transfer process, which has the characteristics of a significant delay, multidisturbance, nonlinearity, strong coupling, and parameter uncertainty. Artificial intelligence (AI) control technology is suitable for solving such complex control problems. In this paper, the mechanism and data dual-drive with equivalent accumulated temperature (EAT) mutual-window AI-control method for continuous grain drying were proposed, and a control system was established. The experimental verification was carried out on the test platform of continuous grain drying. The results show that the method has the ability of implicit prediction, high accuracy, strong stability and self-adaptive ability, and the maximum control deviation of moisture at the outlet of the dryer is -0.58-0.3%. © 2022 by the authors.

Food & Function					The effect of Platycodon grandiflorum (PG) on colitis and its underlying mechanism were rarely studied. In this study, Lactobacillus rhamnosus 217-1 was used to ferment PG roots, and the concentrations of platycodin-D, flavonoids, and polyphenols and the DPPH free radical scavenging rate were significantly increased. Treatment with a PG root fermentation broth (PGRFB) could reduce dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) induced ulcerative colitis (UC) in mice. Meanwhile, the PGRFB significantly reduced the content of inflammatory factors in mouse serum and the expression of inflammatory factor mRNA in the intestinal tract, regulated the polarization of M1/M2macrophages, and increased the expression of tight junction protein mRNA in intestinal epithelial cells. In summary, it was proved that the PGRFB could inhibit the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) signaling pathway and the expression of Nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasomes by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and lowering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	7	3946	3956	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03969e					FSTA:2022-07-Aj12694

J		Zhe Zhang; Shuai Guo; Ting Wu; Yang Yang; Xuejian Yu; Su Yao							Inoculum size of co-fermentative culture affects the sensory quality and volatile metabolome of fermented milk over storage.		Journal of Dairy Science					Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PC-01 is a probiotic candidate isolated from naturally fermented yak milk in Lhasa, Tibet, and it has been shown to possess excellent milk fermentation properties. This study used Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PC-01 as a co-fermentation strain to investigate the effect of inoculum size with a commercial starter in milk fermentation on the product flavor and profile of volatile metabolites over 28 d of cold storage. Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PC-01 was allowed to ferment in pasteurized milk with or without the commercial starter (YF-L904) at 42°C until the pH decreased to 4.5. The finished fermented milks were stored at 10°C for 28 d. Milk samples were taken at hour 0 (before fermentation) and then at d 1, 14, and 28 of cold storage. Different inoculum sizes of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PC-01 had no significant effect on pH or titratable acidity during storage of fermented milk. Viable counts of strain PC-01 continued to increase during cold storage of the fermented milk. Generally, as storage of fermented milk proceeded, the overall sensory quality score decreased in all groups. However, the overall sensory scores of PC-01-M were generally higher than those of other groups, suggesting that a medium dose of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei PC-01 had the most obvious effect of slowing the decline in sensory quality of fermented milk during storage. Changes in sensory scores and consumer preferences were accompanied by increases in both the quantity and variety of key volatile metabolites in fermented milk during fermentation, post-ripening (d 1), and storage. Major differentially abundant metabolites, including acetaldehyde, methyl ketones, medium-chain and short-chain fatty acids, 2,3-butanedione, and acetoin, were enriched in fermented milks rated highly in the sensory evaluation. Our data confirmed that the inoculum size of co-fermentative culture affected the sensory quality and volatile metabolome of fermented milk over storage, and an optimal range of co-fermentative culture was titrated in this work.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Selenium (Se)-enriched glycoproteins have been a research highlight for the role of both Se and glycoproteins in immunoregulation. Arsenic (As) is a toxicant that is potentially toxic to the immune function and consequently to human health. Several reports suggested that Se could reduce the toxicity of heavy metals. Moreover, more and more nutrients in food had been applied to relieve As-induced toxicity. Hence glycoproteins were isolated and purified from Se-enriched Grifola frondosa, and their preliminary characteristics as well as amelioration effect and mechanism on As3+-induced immune toxicity were evaluated. Results. Four factions, namely Se-GPr11 (electrophoresis analysis exhibited one band: 14.32kDa), Se-GPr22 (two bands: 20.57 and 31.12kDa), Se-GPr33 (three bands: 15.08,20.57 and 32.78kDa) and Se-GPr44 (three bands: 16.73, 32.78 and 42.46kDa), were obtained from Se-enriched G. frondosa via DEAE-52 and Sephacryl S-400 column. In addition, Se-GPr11 and Se-GPr44 are ideal proteins that contain high amounts of almost all essential amino acids. Thereafter, the RAW264.7 macrophage model was adopted to estimate the effect of Se-GPr11 and Se-GPr44 on As3+-induced immune toxicity. The results showed that the pre-intervention method was the best consequent and the potential mechanisms were, first, by improving the oxidative stress state (enhancing the activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, decreasing the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde); secondly, through nuclear factor-kappaB and mitogen-activated protein kinase-mediated upregulation cytokines (interleukin-2 and interferon-gamma) secretion induced by As3+. Conclusion. The results suggested Se-enriched G. frondosa may be a feasible supplement to improve health level of the As3+ pollution population. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	6	2526	2537	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11594					FSTA:2022-07-Jq8587

M.; Peng Zhou							Sea cucumber enzymatic hydrolysates relieve osteoporosis through OPG/RANK/RANKL system in ovariectomized rats.		Food Bioscience					Osteoporosis harms human health and has a variety of causes, among which the imbalance of bone metabolism caused by menopause is an important one. Studies have shown that sea cucumbers have a variety of physiological activities such as anti-inflammation. Sea cucumber enzymatic hydrolysates (SCEH) were prepared and characterized for peptides and polysaccharides, and then the effects on relieving osteoporosis were explored by feeding ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats for 90 days. Bone density and microstructure were measured using micro-CT and pathological sectioning. Serum markers for bone metabolism, and inflammation were measured using ELISA kits. Gene transcription and expression of the OPG/RANKL system in bone were measured using qRT-PCR and western blots. Results showed that SCEH could improve the bone density, strength, microstructure and mass, and inhibit the generation of osteoclasts. The abnormally elevated markers for bone resorption, formation and inflammation were reduced with the intake of SCEH. The mRNA and protein expressions of RANKL were also decreased by feeding SCEH, thereby up-regulating the ratio of OPG to RANKL. These results suggested that SCEH could inhibit the bone resorption by inhibiting the NF-kappaB pathway related to osteoclast generation via the down-regulation of both the RANKL level and inflammatory response, and also improve the balance of bone metabolism, thus obtaining the effects of increasing bone density and relieving osteoporosis. SCEH with a medium-dose (1000 mg/kg body weight) had the best remission effect and could be used as a potential starting material to develop healthy foods that can assist in treating osteoporosis.

Foods					This study aimed to characterize the structure of Chinese yam (Dioscoreae Rhizoma) polysaccharide (CYP) and to investigate its protective effect against H2O2-induced oxidative damage in IEC-6 cells. The chemical composition and structural characteristics of the samples were analyzed by chemical and instrumental methods, including high-performance gel permeation chromatography, high-performance anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC), Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR), ultraviolet (UV), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Antioxidant activity was evaluated by establishing a cellular model of oxidative damage. The molecular weight of CYP was 20.89 kDa. Analysis of the monosaccharide composition revealed that CYP was primarily comprised of galactose (Gal), glucose (Glu), and galacturonic acid (GalA), and the ratio between them was 28.57:11.28:37.59. Pretreatment with CYP was able to improve cell viability, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and reduce intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) content after H2O2 injury. CYP also attenuated oxidative damage in cells through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. This study showed that CYP was an acidic heteropolysaccharide with a good protective effect against oxidative damage, and it thus has good prospects in food and biopharmaceutical industries. © 2022 by the authors.

Ismail; Yaqin Hu; Mingming Guo							Ultrasonication induced nano-emulsification of thyme essential oil: optimization and antibacterial mechanism against Escherichia coli.		Food Control					This study optimized the ultrasound emulsification process using response surface methodology (RSM) to obtain thyme essential oil nanoemulsions (TEON) with excellent dispersion characteristics and antibacterial activity. Based on the single-factor experiments, the effects of ultrasonic power (350-550 W), time (5-15 min) and emulsifier [Tween 80 (T80), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)] concentrations were determined on response variables, including droplet size, PDI, zeta-potential, MIC, and MBC. Further analysis of stability and antibacterial mechanism were also conducted based on the optimal results. TEON-T80, obtained at 527.45 W, 9.97 min, and 5.94 mg/mL with good stability, killed E. coli through extracellular release, whereas TEON-CPC obtained at 350 W, 14.44 min, and 0.15 mg/mL exhibited excellent antibacterial activity through electrostatic interaction. TEON-SDS obtained at 350 W, 15 min, and 1 mg/mL was poor in stability and antibacterial activity. All nanoemulsions destroyed cell morphology and caused severe cytoplasm leakage. Through a preliminary antibacterial mechanism study, we hypothesized a controlled in vitro release for TEON-T80, electrostatic interaction for TEON-CPC, and self-assembly together with cell penetration for TEON-SDS. Considering all the results, TEON-CPC was determined as the best nanoemulsion for optimal antibacterial activity. Also, optimizing the ultrasonication process is useful for preparing TEON with enhanced dispersion characteristics and antibacterial activity.

J		Zheljazkov, V. D.; Noller, J. S.; Maggi, F.; Dale, R.							Terpenes and cannabinoids yields and profile from direct-seeded and transplanted CBD-Cannabis sativa.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Following recent legalization, the production of hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) for high-value plant compounds became a major crop in many countries across the world. In this study, we profiled popular plant compounds being extracted for emerging markets, terpenes and cannabinoids, developed in two different planting systems of a single, high-cannabidiol (CBD), low-Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta9-THC), dioecious hemp cultivar "Culver" in central Oregon, U.S.A. One system is the current conventional system of an open, all-female, clonal transplant (OFCT) production system. This is compared to a dioecious, densely seeded (DDS) production system. Overall, the essential oil (EO, chiefly terpenes) and cannabinoid profiles of plants harvested from the two systems were comparable. In comparison to the DDS plots, the EO obtained from colas of the OFCT plots had higher concentrations of alpha-pinene, myrcene, limonene, beta-bisabolene, gamma-cadinene, caryophyllene oxide, guaiol, 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol, beta-eudesmol, bulnesol, epi-alpha-bisabolol, alpha-humulene, and CBD, although lower concentrations of 1,8-cineole, (E)-caryophyllene, gamma-elemene, alpha-selinene, selina-4 (15), 7 (11)-diene, selina-3,7 (11)-diene, and germacrene B. Of the various plant parts (female leaves and chaff, male flowers) tested in the DDS plots, the highest EO yield was obtained from the chaff. The main EO constituents of female leaves were (E)-caryophyllene (14-21%), caryophyllene oxide (13-16%), alpha-humulene (5-6%), humulene epoxide II (3.5-3.8%), epi-alpha-bisabolol (2.7-5.5%), CBD, and alpha-eudesmol (1.1-2.6%). The principal EO constituents of female chaff from the DDS system were (E)-caryophyllene (~21%), alpha-humulene (6.6%), beta-selinene (4.5%), alpha-selinene (3.6%), selina-3,7 (11)-diene (9.8%), selina-4 (15), 7 (11)-diene (6.3%), caryophyllene oxide (5.2%), and cannabichromene (3.1%). The major EO constituents of the male flowers were CBD (19.3%), caryophyllene oxide (11%), alpha-humulene (4.1%), epi-alpha-bisabolol (3.9%), selina-3,7 (11)-diene (3.4%), and beta-selinene (3.4%). Cannabinoids were not detected in the EO distilled for 30 min, but they were present in the EO from 240 min of distillation. The EO content of female leaves and male flowers was relatively low, whereas the EO content of the female chaff from the DDS system was significantly greater. Breaking with conventional knowledge, the EO of male flowers may accumulate up to 19% CBD. Distillation of plants from both production systems converted CBD-A to CBD, CBDV-A to CBDV, CBG-A to CBG, and THC-A to THC as a result of the thermal decarboxylation of acidic cannabinoids but otherwise did not affect the total cannabinoid content. Most of the cannabinoids remained in the distilled biomass after the extraction of terpenes (EO). Therefore, the distilled, terpene-free biomass represents a high-value product that could be further extracted for cannabinoids or used as a component in various products.										2022	70	34	10417	10428	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06912					FSTA:2023-01-Aj1431

Melissa officinalis L. as a sprout suppressor in Solanum tuberosum L. and an alternative to synthetic pesticides.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The goal of this research was to screen plant essential oils (EOs) as sprout inhibitors or suppressors in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). Three controlled environment experiments were conducted to screen 18 EOs and several pure compounds as sprout inhibitors. The EOs were applied using the wicked method on potato cv. Gala in 19 L plastic containers. The results indicated that Melissa officinalis L. EO inhibited sprouting, while Coriandrum sativum L. seed oil and the EO blend of Lavandula angustifolia Mill. and Salvia sclarea L. suppressed sprouting. The EOs of interest were analyzed using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and/or a flame ionization detector (GC-FID); the detailed chemical profiles are provided. The M. officinalis EO was fractionated into seven fractions, and these were tested on minitubers. We identified two fractions (F and A) that suppressed potato sprouting better than the whole oil. The GC-MS-FID analyses of M. officinalis EO fraction A identified myrcene, Z-ocimene, E-ocimene, trans-caryophyllene, and alpha-humulene as the main constituents, while the main constituents of fraction F were alpha-terpineol, beta-citronellol, and geraniol. The pure isolated compounds, together with the major compound in M. officinalis EO (citral), were tested for sprout suppression on three potato cultivars (Ranger Russet, Terra Rosa, and Dakota TrailBlazer), which revealed that beta-citronellol reduced the sprout length and the number of sprouts in all three cultivars, while citral and (+)-alpha-terpineol reduced the sprout length and the number of sprouts in Ranger Russet relative to the two controls in all three cultivars. Myrcene had a stimulating effect on the number of sprouts in Cv. Terra Rosa. However, none of the pure compounds suppressed sprouting completely or were comparable to the EO of M. officinalis.

Food Chemistry					Plasmalogens are functional and oxidation-sensitive phospholipids abundant in fish. Chilling and freezing are common storage methods for maintaining the quality of fish, but their effect on plasmalogen preservation has not been studied. Therefore, plasmalogen loss in ready-to-eat tuna meat during storage under different conditions was investigated. LC/MS was used to analyze the time- and temperature-dependent changes of plasmalogens, which was the most evident for the species with an ethanolamine headgroup and polyunsaturated fatty acyl chains. Moreover, a series of oxidized plasmalogen molecules were identified, and their storage-induced accumulation was observed. Plasmalogen loss was strongly correlated with total lipid oxidation and phospholipid degradation. Repeated freeze-thaw cycles were found to accelerate the loss of plasmalogens, whereas the different thawing methods did not. The present study provides a deeper understanding of changes in lipid nutrients from fish meat during storage and demonstrates the importance of using advanced strategies to maintain food quality.

J		Zhen Dai; Jinguang Liu; Xuan Yao; Anqi Wang; Yuqian Liu; Strappe, P.; Weining Huang; Zhongkai Zhou							Association of gut microbiota characteristics and metabolites reveals the regulation mechanisms under cadmium consumption circumstance.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cadmium is a non-biodegradable heavy metal with a long biological half-life. Although its negative impact on human health has been previously reported, the association of cadmium consumption overdose with changes in the gut microbiota and its corresponding metabolites has not been fully elucidated so far. Results. Cadmium consumption overdose led to a reduced body weight gain accompanied by an enhanced level of the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and histamine in the serum of the rats in comparison with normal rats. Furthermore, hepatotoxicity was also observed to be induced by cadmium, which was consistent with abnormal hepatic activities of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase and oxidative stress. In contrast, Lactobacillus rhamnosus-fermented Ganoderma lucidum (FGL) slice supplementation improved the aforementioned physiological properties. More importantly, microbiome and metabolites analysis indicated cadmium exposure significantly reduced the generation of short-chain fatty acids in the gut, particularly butyrate. However, rats in the FGL group had the highest level of butyrate in the feces, characterized with significantly enriched probiotics (Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium) and butyrate-producing bacteria (Roseburia). Conclusion. The targeted regulation of the gut microbial community and its metabolites might be the essential association for attenuating body dysfunction induced by cadmium. The supplementation of FGL, as evidenced in this study, might highlight a novel approach to this field.										2022	102	14	6737	6748	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12041					FSTA:2023-01-Cf0409

Food Chemistry					Application of the traditional immunochromatographic assay (ICGA) has been limited by its poor sensitivity. The objective of this study was to increase the sensitivity of the traditional ICGA. A dual-mode ICGA (D-M ICGA) was developed by combining a nanozyme-assisted signal-amplification strategy with a magnetic-nanoparticle-based flow-speed-control strategy. Salmonella typhimurium can be detected simultaneously based on color and magnetic signals in the detection area of the D-M ICGA strip. The calculated limits of detection of 50 cfu.mL-1 and 75 cfu.mL-1 in the color and magnetic modes, respectively, were approximately 1000 times lower than those of the traditional ICGA. The selectivity and practical applicability of the D-M ICGA were also confirmed in this study. The results prove that the D-M ICGA is an assay that could be used for Salmonella typhimurium detection and can be easily adapted to detect other pathogenic bacteria.

Food & Function					Glucan is the most widely distributed glycan. Many probiotics such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) encoded corresponding hydrolytic enzymes, which could use these glucans as energy substances. Brown alga is rich in glucan and has high edible and medicinal value, but research on its regulation to probiotics is not detailed enough. In this study, we determined a novel neutral alpha type gluco-oligosaccharide from the brown alga Laminaria japonica with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 2-8 and a structure that mainly consists of alpha-(14)-linked glycosidic bonds called Laminaria japonica gluco-oligosaccharide (LJGO). Fermentation in vitro and gene-phenotype correlation analyses revealed that LJGO selectively stimulated the growth of the LAB strain encoding a specific ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transport system in a GH13gene cluster, with apparent differences among 14 tested species. Comparative genomics further revealed that this transport system is species-specific, implying a potential contribution to species evolution. Transcriptomic analysis based on LAB strains cultured on LJGO and1H-NMR findings of LJGO residues after strain utilization showed that the GH13gene cluster contains functional LAB genes involved in LJGO utilization. Further verification by gene knockout studies is needed to expand our findings. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	21	11153	11168	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01981g					FSTA:2023-02-Rg0923
J		Zhen Li; Zhaozong Meng; Soutis, C.; Ping Wang; Gibson, A.							Detection and analysis of metallic contaminants in dry foods using a microwave resonator sensor.		Food Control					Current systems for metal detection in dry food processing are limited by relatively large foreign objects and high-cost implementation. These issues are resolved here using a non-contact, cylindrical microwave cavity resonator sensor where food passes through the cavity and metallic objects are detected by a shift in the resonant frequency. Classic perturbation theory is applied to the basic set-up and numerical simulations are used to verify the design of the sensor. A cavity sensor was fabricated with a quartz tube symmetrically located for dry food flow and metal detection. Good performance is demonstrated for a range of foods such as spaghetti, noodles, rice, wheat flour and soy milk powder. It is shown that the resonance frequency shift becomes larger when the foreign body gets closer to the cavity centre. The frequency variation is directly related to the volume of the object, and it is estimated that the minimum diameter of a detectable ball can be lower than 2 mm. For completeness it is also observed that the set-up can be used to detect dielectric objects. A graphical user interface is developed for practical applications. The method proposed is low-cost, convenient, scalable and complementary to other metallic contaminant detection approaches.

J		Zhen Li; Ling Wu; Zongyun Yang; Yulong Zhang; Peng Wang; Xinglian Xu							Improved identification and classification accuracy of wooden breast by jointly using near-infrared spectroscopy and compression speed.		Food Research International					A uniform standard for classifying wooden breast (WB) is still being explored. The palpation method is the most common grading method in WB, but it requires a large number of people, who need professional sensory training. This study aims to verify the feasibility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and compression speed for the classification of WB. The quality characteristics of different categories of WB and normal breast (NB) show that the hardness of raw WB is significantly higher than that of NB, but no difference was observed in the shear force between NB and WB. The water holding capacity (WHC) of NB is better, and the weight, height, redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) of WB are higher than those of NB. Afterward, the NIR and compression speed were used to identify and classify WB by using Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA). The results show that the NIR can effectively distinguish between NB and WB, the total classification accuracy of modeling and prediction are 85.71% and 81.58%, respectively. Then, for WB, the compression speed was further used to achieve precise classification and the total classification accuracy of modeling and prediction from PLSDA are 80.65% and 82.14%, respectively. To a certain extent, the compression speed inspired by ergonomics can quantify and simulate the palpation method. The results clarify that WB and NB can be identified by combining the compression speed and NIR, and it can be used as an assessment tool for food classification.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Bracken (Pteridium aquilinum var. latiusculum) is susceptible to senescence and quality deterioration after harvest, which seriously affects its commodity value and shelf-life. In this study, the individual and combined effects of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and tea polyphenols coating (TPC) on the postharvest senescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism of bracken during storage at 41 °C for 15 d were investigated. The results showed that 1-MCP or TPC treatment significantly delayed the reduction of overall quality and nutritional value, suppressed the ethylene production, respiration rate, relative conductivity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and the accumulation of ROS, increased the ability of antioxidant system in comparison with the control during storage (P< 0.05). Notably, the effect of combined treatment of 1-MCP and TPC was more prominent than that of 1-MCP or TPC treatment alone. Furthermore, the Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that postharvest bracken senescence was accompanied by an elevation in ethylene production, respiration rate, relative conductivity, MDA content, ROS levels and decreasing in overall quality, thus further confirming the close relationship between ROS metabolism and bracken senescence. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that combined "1-MCP+ TPC" treatment can effectively delay postharvest senescence and maintain the commodity quality of bracken by increasing the ability of antioxidant system and mitigating ROS accumulation during the storage.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, garlic bulbs after harvesting blanched garlic leaves at four different growth periods were used as the main experimental objects, and black garlic was prepared by solid-state fermentation at variable temperatures. The volatile organic compounds and flavor fingerprints of black garlic were analyzed by headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS), and the differences of volatile organic compounds in black garlic were compared by principal component analysis (PCA). The physical and chemical indexes of black garlic changed slightly. As the Maillard reaction went on more thoroughly, the content of 5-HMF in black garlic increased. GC-IMS provided information on the characteristics and intensity of 55 volatile organic compounds (monomers and dimers). The results showed that the relative content of organosulfur compounds in black garlic decreased gradually with the extension of the garlic bulb growth period, which was due to the inherent instability of the organosulfur compounds and more complex compounds being formed as precursors in further reactions. The results by PCA showed that BG0 samples can be well distinguished from BG20 samples. Novelty impact statement.

J		Zhen Ma; Jing Cheng; Shunshan Jiao; Pu Jing							Interaction of mulberry anthocyanins with soybean protein isolate: effect on the stability of anthocyanins and protein in vitro digestion characteristics.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The interactions of anthocyanins and proteins might mutually influence each other on the physicochemical and functional properties. In this study, the interaction mechanism of soybean protein isolate (SPI) with mulberry anthocyanins (MA), and its effect on the thermal stability of anthocyanins and protein subunits' digestibility were investigated through multiple spectroscopies and in vitro gastrointestinal models. Results showed that cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G), the main anthocyanin monomer in MA, could bind to SPI through hydrophobic interactions, resulting in static fluorescence quenching of SPI. The secondary structure of SPI changed by binding to C3G, with an increase of beta-sheet and a decrease of alpha-helix and random coil. The formation of the SPI-MA complexes improved the thermal stability of MA at 353K, while, no significant protection occurred during heating at 368K. Complexation with MA promoted the digestibility of SPI by pepsin, especially the alpha′ and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin and the basic subunit of glycinin, and slightly delayed the digestibility of SPI under intestinal fluid. These results provide an in-depth understanding of the influence of the protein-anthocyanin interactions on the stability of anthocyanins and protein digestibility. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	4	2267	2276	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15576					FSTA:2022-07-Jf8519

Food Research International					The maturity of tea leaves has a great influence on the flavor quality and commercial price of tea. In this work, a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis was applied to investigate the differences in protein expression and metabolites among tea leaves with different maturity. Integrated analysis showed that there were significant differences in 112 nonvolatile components related to the pathways of photosynthesis, glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and the biosynthesis of amino acids, phenylpropanoids and flavonoids. The bud had higher expression levels of most enzymes related to the biosynthesis of amino acids, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoids, leading to higher levels of amino acids, most flavanols, and procyanidins compared with the leaves. The 1st leaf showed a higher expression level of flavonol synthase, which produces higher levels of flavonol-3-glycosides. This study offers deep insight into the maturity of tea at both the protein and metabolite levels and provides a guideline for tea manufacturing.

Food Chemistry					Niulanshan Baijiu (NLS) is a light-flavor Baijiu (LFB) with a long history. The aroma-active compounds in six NLSs with different storage years were analyzed using gas chromatography-olfactometry-mass spectrometry (GC-O-MS), coupled with Osme and aroma extraction dilution analysis (AEDA). A total of 59 odorants were identified, 5 odorants of them were, for the first time, identified as aroma-active compounds of LFB. After quantifying and calculating their odorant activity values (OAVs), 34 compounds had OAVs > 1, and the recombination and omission experiments further confirmed that ethyl acetate, ethyl acrylate, ethyl 2-methylbutyrate, gamma-nonalactone, ethyl isovalerate, ethyl butyrate, isoamyl acetate, ethyl caprylate, ethyl valerate, 3-methylbutanal, beta-damascenone, and geosmin have important contributions to the aroma of NLS. One-way ANOVA analysis further found that the contents of key odorants in NLS stored for four to five years were relatively stable.

J		Zhen Wang; Yue Ma; Zhuosi Li; Yuan Wang; Yangtai Liu; Qingli Dong							Characterization of Listeria monocytogenes biofilm formation kinetics and biofilm transfer to cantaloupe surfaces.		Food Research International					Listeria monocytogenes biofilm is a consistent source of cross-contamination, both in housing storage and food processing environments. This study monitored the dynamic process of L. monocytogenes ST9 and ST87 biofilms, as well as their cross-contamination behaviors at various stages of formation. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) captured the honeycomb-like structures and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) during the biofilm formation. Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) images illustrated that the ST87 strain formed a closed knitted chains network later than the ST9 strain. Moreover, structural parameters including bio-volume, mean thickness, porosity, and roughness could quantified the spatio-temporal differences of the biofilms. The transfer rates of biofilm cells to cantaloupes with the single contact had no significant difference at the initial adhesion, maturation, and dispersion stage (p> 0.05). Notably, the biofilm cells remained on the glass coupons when transferred to ten cantaloupe slices, indicating that biofilm cells transferred through cohesive failure. Meanwhile, the Logistic model could describe the transfer law of biofilm cells at different formation stages, as evaluated by Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and R2adj. Additionally, the transfer rates were positively correlated with the hydrophobicity of L. monocytogenes ST87 biofilm cells measured by xylene. However, when the hydrophobicity of n-hexadecane was measured, the correlation was negative. This study illustrated the spatial and temporal differences during L. monocytogenes biofilms formation, and the transfer and residual of biofilm cells after a single and ten successive contacts at the specific stages. Our findings help in the quantitative microbiological risk assessment of fresh produce.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The supplementation of dietary fibre in sourdough is beneficial to increase the nutritional quality of fermented foods. The influence of different wheat bran dietary fibre (WBDF) levels (0%, 3%, 6%, 9%, and 12%) on the biochemical characteristics of sourdough during fermentation was investigated. This study showed that WBDF was slightly resistant to the reduced pH caused by the initial fermentation of sourdough dough. After 6h of fermentation, whether or not it contained WBDF, the dough's amylase activity was relatively stable (P>0.05). However, in the samples containing WBDF, it took longer for the amylase activity to increase from 200 to 300 Ug-1. The content of free amino acids in the dough showed a tendency to first decrease and then increase with the metabolic activity of microorganisms, and WBDF could accelerate this rate. This study also provided evidence that insoluble dietary fibre may stimulate the growth and reproduction of lactic acid bacteria. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	4	1995	2002	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15327					FSTA:2022-07-Mn3746
J		Zhen Wang; Jun Sun; Yadan Du; Wenquan Niu							Conservation tillage improves the yield of summer maize by regulating soil water, photosynthesis and inferior kernel grain filling on the semiarid Loess Plateau, China.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Poor inferior kernel grain filling is a challenge that limits summer maize yield. The effect and mechanism of conservation tillage on improving grain filling of inferior kernel in semi-arid rained areas remain uncertain and there has been little research on tillage management integrated with straw mulching to improve soil water content and photosynthesis in the Loess Plateau region. A 2 year (2019-2020) field experiment was established to study the impact of tillage practices on soil water content and summer maize root system morphology, photosynthetic capacity, inferior kernel grain filling, and grain yield. Treatments included reduced tillage (RT), no tillage (NT), and conventional tillage (CT). Results. Under RT and NT, the final 100-kernel weight and maximum and mean grain filling rates were higher than CT. Reduced tillage and NT increased soil water content at the jointing stage, silking stage and grain filling stage in comparison with CT. They increased root system morphology and dry matter accumulation, net photosynthetic rate, transpiration efficiency, and stomatal conductance in comparison with CT, and they also decreased intercellular CO2 concentration, and they increased chlorophyll content and above-ground dry matter accumulation in comparison with CT. Reduced tillage and NT increased evapotranspiration of maize, and ultimately, increased grain yield by 17% and 14%, respectively, in comparison with CT. Conclusion. Conservation tillage could promote summer maize photosynthetic capacity and grain filling of inferior kernels by regulating soil water content and root system morphology. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	6	2330	2341	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11571					FSTA:2022-07-Mc3782
J		Zhen Wu; Yang Hu; Xiaoli Pan; Yue Tang; Yifeng Dai; Yuangen Wu							A liquid colorimetric chemosensor for ultrasensitive detection of glyphosate residues in vegetables using a metal oxide with intrinsic peroxidase catalytic activity.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The control of pesticide residues in food is of increasing importance nowadays due to the over-use and misapplication of herbicides in agricultural production. However, the current colorimetric method for rapid detection of glyphosate still faces many challenges like the low sensitivity and stability. Herein, a simple and ultrasensitive liquid colorimetric chemosensor for glyphosate detection was successfully constructed. Glyphosate pesticide can interact with metallic oxidelike porous Co3O4 nanodisc, and inhibit its inherent peroxidase-mimicking activity, making the colour of the solution change from blue to light blue or even colourless. The colour variation of the colorimetric chemosensor enables us to easily distinguish in less than 20min even by the naked eye whether glyphosate exceeds the allowable level. The limit of detection (LOD) of the chemosensor for glyphosate was calculated as low as 2.37mug.l-1, and the chemosensor displays excellent selectivity against other competitive pesticides and metal ions. Further studies have also validated the applicability of the colorimetric chemosensor in actual samples like tomato, cucumber and cabbage, indicating that the proposed strategy may have promising application prospects for detecting glyphosate residues in agricultural products. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	4	710	723	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.2020912					FSTA:2022-08-Jh11257
J		Zhen Wu; Ruiping Gao; Hong Li; Xia Liao; Xin Tang; Xiaogang Wang; Zhimin Su							How steaming and drying processes affect the active compounds and antioxidant types of Gastrodia elata Bl. f. glauca S. chow.		Food Research International					As both a traditional medicine and food material, fresh Gastrodia elata requires a curing process for quality improvement. The effects of steaming and various drying methods (sun-, hot-air-, microwave-vacuum-, freeze-and vacuum-drying) on the total phenolic, total flavonoid, ascorbic acid, adenosine, and phenolic compound contents, antioxidant activities (scavenging DPPH., ABTS.+ , OH. and reducing power) and microstructures were investigated in this study. The contents of adenosine and individual phenolic compounds were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. The results showed that steaming had adverse effects on the total phenolic, total flavonoid, adenosine, parishin C, vanillyl alcohol, quercetin and cinnamic acid contents, while subsequent hot-air-and freeze-drying showed compensatory effects. Steaming significantly increased the levels of gastrodin, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, parishins (A, B and E) and catechin (by 3.4-, 1.1-, 1.1-, 3.8-, 6-, 1.4-and 1.5-fold, respectively, p< 0.05) compared to the fresh samples, which were further increased by hot-air-and freeze-drying. Hot-air-and freeze-drying significantly increased the levels of adenosine, gastrodin, p-hydroxybenzylalcohol, p-hydroxybenzaldehyde, parishins (A, B and C), vanillyl alcohol, catechin, caffeic acid, quercetin and cinnamic acid by 1.1-11.6-fold (p< 0.05) compared to steaming treatment. Steaming reduced all the antioxidant activities, which were restored partially by hot-air-and freeze-drying. Principal component and clustering analyses revealed the relationship among the samples, phenolics, and antioxidant activities, which suggested a steaming-then-drying action mechanism in which steaming changes enzymes and starch hydrolysis and drying promote condensation reactions. Collectively, steaming-then-hot-air-or freeze-drying is a promising method for enhancing the quality of Gastrodia elata for food applications.

Food Research International					Natural organic selenium (Se) has multiple physiological health benefits and has become a hotspot of research in recent years. In this study, the Se-enriched antioxidant peptides were purified from Se-enriched oyster hydrolysate. Three novel Se-enriched antioxidant peptides LLVSeMY (685.2953 Da), MMDSeML (687.1875 Da) and VSeMDSeML (703.1599 Da) were identified from fraction F6-4, which all exhibited strong cellular antioxidant activity (CAA) with EC50 values of 0.739, 0.423, and 0.395mug/mL, respectively. These three Se-enriched antioxidant peptides (0.025mg/mL) could significantly enhanced cell viability to 84.60 3.32% ~ 86.18 1.36% compared with the AAPH injury group (75.99 0.79%), and the cytoprotective effects were even better than that of GSH (80.47 2.78%). Moreover, these three Se-enriched peptides also significantly protected HepG2 cells from AAPH-induced oxidative injury by inhibiting ROS production and enhancing the activities of antioxidant enzymes. The molecular docking results showed that these three Se-enriched peptides can form stable hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with key amino acid residues of Keap1 protein, thereby potentially regulating the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway. In conclusion, the three novel Se-enriched oyster antioxidant peptides are expected to be used in medicine or functional food, providing a new theoretical basis for the high-value utilization of natural organic Se.

J		Zhen Xu; Li-Li Hong; Chun-Sheng Liu; Jian-Qiang Kong							Protein engineering of PhUGT, a donor promiscuous glycosyltransferase, for the improved enzymatic synthesis of antioxidant quercetin 3-O-N-acetylgalactosamine.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Quercetin 3-O-N-acetylgalactosamine (Q3GalNAc), a derivative of dietary hyperoside, had never been enzymatically synthesized due to the lack of well-identified N-acetylgalactosamine-transferase (GalNAc-T). Herein, PhUGT, an identified flavonoid 3-O-galactosyltransferase from Petunia hybrida, was demonstrated to display quercetin GalNAc-T activity, transferring a N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) from UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc) to the 3-OH of quercetin to form Q3GalNAc with a low conversion of 11.7% at 40°C for 2 h. Protein engineering was thus performed, and the resultant PhUGT variant F368T got an enhanced conversion of 75.5% toward UDP-GalNAc. The enzymatically synthesized Q3GalNAc exhibited a comparable antioxidant activity with other quercetin 3-O-glycosides. Further studies revealed that PhUGT was a donor promiscuous glycosyltransferase (GT), recognizing seven sugar donors. This finding overturned a previous notion that PhUGT exclusively recognized UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal). The reason why PhUGT was mistaken for a UDP-Gal-specific GT was demonstrated to be a shorter reaction time, in which many quercetin 3-O-glycosides, except hyperoside, could not be effectively synthesized. The fact that the microbial cell factory expressing PhUGT could yield an array of Q3Gs further confirmed the donor promiscuity of PhUGT. This study laid a foundation for the scale production of Q3GalNAc and provided a potent biocatalyst capable of glycodiversifying quercetin as well.										2022	70	13	4076	4085	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01029					FSTA:2022-08-Bc1333

Food Research International					Yellow pigments in the water-extract of safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) belong to quinochalcone flavonoid family and are widely used as food colourants. The aim of the study was to characterize the main quinochalcone compounds in safflower water-extract during blooming period when floret changed colour. Mass-spectrometry results showed that hydroxysafflor yellow A (HSYA) and anhydrosafflor yellow B (AHSYB) were the most abundant. Based on 370 florets samples collected from 144 cultivars, the contents of HSYA and AHSYB were determined, which showed that only AHSYB content had relatively strong positive association with colour indexes. The ratio of HSYA/AHSYB and visual colour exhibited certain patterns: yellow = 2, orange = 3-4, red = more dispersed, mostly falling 5-6. Most of the florets had HSYA increased first and decreased, while AHSYB decreased all the time when floret changed colour as yellow orange red. Regardless of the composition of HSYA/AHSYB in florets, the antioxidant capacities of safflower petal water-extracts were the same.

J		Zhen Yang; Ying Zhou; Jun-Jie Xing; Xiao-Na Guo; Ke-Xue Zhu							Effect of superheated steam treatment and extrusion on lipid stability of black soybean noodles during storage.		Food Control					This study investigated the effect of superheated steam treatment (SST) and extrusion treatment (ET) on the changes of lipids in black soybean noodles (BSN) during storage. Degradation of lipids and formation of volatile compounds were closely related to the endogenous lipid-degrading enzyme activity. Both SST and ET could effectively inactivate lipase, lipoxygenase and peroxidase activity in black soybeans, and thus in the BSN. The content of polyunsaturated fatty acids decreased by 43.6% in non-heat-treated BSN during 7-week storage, whereas the reduction was only 23.0% and 20.7% in SST-190 °C and ET-130 °C groups, respectively. The degradation of tocopherols and tocotrienols, and formation of volatile compounds in the BSN was greatly inhibited during storage by the two heat processes, and ET seems to be more effective. In conclusion, both SST and ET were able to increase the lipid stability of BSN by inhibit the activity of lipid-degrading enzymes. This study could also provide more knowledge that assists to develop high quality of black soybean food products.

Journal of Functional Foods					ZSWF, a traditional Chinese medicine and nutritional supplement for nourishing kidney, presents ameliorating cognitive deficits effect. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Imbalance of neural mitochondrial homeostasis is a pathogenesis of AD. Considering "tonify kidney and nourish encephala" in traditional Chinese medicine theory is consistent with "mitochondria provides energy for neuros to maintain brain activity", we hypothesized whether ZSWF could improve cognitive ability by regulating neuronal mitochondrial homeostasis. In this study, we firstly confirmed that ZSWF could improve the cognitive function of SAMP8 mice, alleviate histopathological lesion and inhibit neuro apoptosis. Then the components of ZSWF in cerebrospinal fluid and hippocampus were identified to fish their potential targets, which further indicated ZSWF might regulate mitochondrial homeostasis. Experimentally, we verified that ZSWF could reverse the neuronal mitochondrial loss of SAMP8 mice by upregulating PINK1, Parkin and PGC-1alpha to simultaneously regulate mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis to maintain mitochondrial homeostasis.

Food Research International					In this study, we systematically assessed how the morphology and texture of edible fruiting bodies of D. indusiata (EFD) varied under three drying techniques: vacuum freeze drying (FD), vacuum drying (VD), and hot air drying (HD). It was discovered that freeze-dried EFD samples (FD-EFD) had an intact microstructure, and thus, a good appearance, textural characteristics, and rehydration properties. Quantitative metabolomic analysis revealed 801metabolites, where 236 211 metabolites were significantly different in abundance in the comparison of hot-air dried EFD samples (HD-EFD) versus FD-EFD and vacuum-dried EFD samples (VD-EFD) versus FD-EFD, respectively. VD and HD significantly affected the abundance of taste-related compounds and resulted in the improvement of EFD's umami. The acidity of EFD is provided by organic acids produced through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. The browning of HD-EFD was caused by Maillard reactions, oxidative degradation of ascorbic acid, and endogenous enzymatic browning process dominated by the phenylalanine metabolic pathway. The metabolomic analysis provides new insights into changes in EFD by different drying processes.

J		Zhen Zhang; Xiaodong Xie; Wan Jun Lee; Guanli Zhao; Changyu Li; Yong Wang							The effects of interesterification on the physicochemical properties of Pangasius bocourti oil and its fractions.		Food Chemistry					Soft and solid fats which were fractionated from Pangasius bocourti oil (PBO), namely, Pangasius bocourti olein (PBOL) and Pangasius bocourti stearin (PBST), respectively, were introduced as new base oils for plastic fats. The physicochemical properties of PBO and its fractions were modified after interesterification. Enzymatic interesterification (EIE) reduced the sn-2 palmitic acid content attributed to the occurrence of acyl migration. The PBO solid fat content (SFC) at 20-40 °C increased after chemical interesterification whereas under similar range of temperature, the SFC of PBST decreased after EIE and a steep melting curve was obtained. The effect of interesterification on the crystal polymorphisms was less prominent whereby the initial and interesterified samples exhibited similar crystal forms. The solid state of PBOL was improved after interesterification but post-hardening was observed. Free fatty acids were produced via partial hydrolysis during EIE which contributed to the reduced oxidative stability in the EIE fats.

Journal of Functional Foods					Elastin peptides display a wide range of biological activities. This study aimed to investigate the ameliorative effect of tuna elastin peptides on adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA). The daily administration of tuna elastin peptides markedly downregulated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulated the immunosuppressive cytokines in the serum, bone, and colon of the AIA model. 16S rRNA sequencing showed that tuna elastin peptide-treated mice exhibited reversed gut microbiota dysbiosis and increased abundance of Lactobacillus and Clostridium. Additionally, metabolomics indicated that short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) production was increased in tuna elastin peptide-treated mice. The ameliorating arthritis effects of tuna elastin peptides were transmitted by transplanting the fecal microbiota from mice treated with high levels of elastin peptides. These results indicate the potential of tuna elastin peptides as beneficial functional food that ameliorates rheumatoid arthritis.

J		Zhen Zhang; Wan Jun Lee; Xiaoxue Sun; Yong Wang							Enzymatic interesterification of palm olein in a continuous packed bed reactor: effect of process parameters on the properties of fats and immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Palm olein (POL) was enzymatically interesterified in a continuous packed bed reactor (PBR). The effects of interesterification parameters (flow rates of 4.5-40g/min and temperatures of 50-90°C) on the properties of interesterified fats and immobilized Thermomyces lanuginosus lipase (Lipozyme TL IM) were investigated. Generally, the percentage of saturated fatty acid at sn-2 remained along with higher flow rates (acyl migration inhibited), while the percentage increased along with higher temperatures and lower flow rates (acyl migration promoted). Solid fat content and crystallization rate of the interesterified fats also showed significant modification with the reaction parameters since these properties are directly influenced by the shift in the triacylglycerol compositions. The occurrence of hydrolysis was also evident during the early stage of interesterification attributed to the lipase's water content, which diminished over time as the water concentration decreased. Under prolonged reaction, the lipase's catalytic activity reduced from 236 U to 65 U, and significant changes in the protein's secondary confirmation were observed. After 100 h of reaction, the alpha-helix structure decreased (from 23.37% to 16.82%) while beta-pleated sheet increased (28.10%-39.59%). The increased fluorescence intensity reflected a significant change in the lipase's tertiary structures.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the effect of 4 different drying methods, i.e. sun-drying (SD), oven-drying (OD), microwave-drying (MD) and vacuum-drying (VD) on the color and microstructure of tiger nuts and quality of its oil. The results showed that SD and VD samples had the desirable color. The morphology of starch granules in cells was changed greatly in OD and MD samples. MD sample had the largest oil yield (22.26%), while VD sample showed the highest extraction rate. The oil extraction kinetic can be well described by an exponential model. In respect of oil quality, SD was ideal for retaining carotenoids, phytosterol and unsaturated fatty acids. The oil from MD sample had the highest oxidation degree, but the longest introduction period (53.27 h), while the one from VD sample had the opposite effect. No significant differences were found in acid value and tocols (tocopherols and tocotrienols) profile between all oil samples. Our results provided a guidance for the selection of drying technique based on specific processing purpose.

J		Zhen-shan Zhang; Xiao-dan Li; Hui-jie Jia; Yu-lan Liu							Moisture sorption isotherms and thermodynamic properties of tiger nuts: an oil-rich tuber.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The moisture adsorption isotherms of tiger nuts were determined by a gravimetric static method at 15, 25, 35°C within the water activity varying from 0.113 to 0.979. Ten mathematical models were selected to fit the adsorption data using non-linear regression technique. Thermodynamic properties such as isosteric heat, sorption entropy and Gibbs free energy were evaluated. The results indicated that equilibrium moisture content of tiger nuts tended to increase with increasing water activity and decreasing temperature. The isotherm curves of tiger nuts exhibited a Type II sigmoidal shape. Peleg model was the most suitable for describing the experimental sorption behavior, followed by the Smith and GAB models. The adsorption surface area and monolayer moisture content of tiger nuts obtained from GAB model were 166.37-149.74m2/g solid and 4.71-4.24 H2O/100g solid, respectively, which decreased with increasing temperature. Moreover, the isosteric heat of adsorption decreased exponentially with the increase of equilibrium moisture content, while the Gibbs free energy was opposite. Adsorption entropy was negative in value and it decreased sharply and then rose slowly as the moisture content increased, having a minimum value (6.43 J/mol K) at a moisture content of 11g/100g d.b.

J		Zhen-Xu Liang; Jin-Zheng Zhang; Chao Xin; Dong Li; Mei-Yu Sun; Lei Shi							Analysis of edible characteristics, antioxidant capacities, and phenolic pigment monomers in Lilium bulbs native to China.		Food Research International					Lilium is cherished for its health-promoting properties in China. The bulbs of Lilium are rich in phenolic compounds, which are associated with antioxidant capacity. However, no systematic evaluation on phenolic compositions and antioxidant capacities for the edible Lilium native to China has been conducted. Herein, bulbs of 56 wild populations and three cultivars were collected. Their edible characteristics, antioxidant capacities, and pigments have been investigated and analyzed. The results showed that phenolic compounds contributed to the major colors (red, yellow and white) in Lilium bulbs. The seven phenolic pigment monomers responsible for the color of bulbs-cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside, isoquercitrin, regaloside B, regaloside C, regaloside H, regaloside A and regaloside D-were identified by the combination of HPLC-MS and NMR analysis. The population Lilium regale E. H. Wilson (Maoxian County, Sichuan Province) had the highest antioxidant capacity. According to the quantification results, Lilium bulbs with darker and redder colors possessed larger biomass, better nutrient compositions, significantly higher bioactive constituents, and higher antioxidant capacities than the three currently consumed cultivars of edible lily bulbs. Overall, these findings suggest that the mountainous area of southwest China could be the fourth source of edible lilies with the bulb-colored Lilium species.

Toxins					Zearalenone (ZEN) is one of the mycotoxins that pose high risks for human and animal health, as well as food safety. However, the regulators involved in ZEN cellular toxicity remain largely unknown. Herein, we showed that cell viability of porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2) tended to decrease with increasing doses of ZEN by the cell counting kit-8 assay. Expression of the ISLR2 (immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat 2) gene in IPEC-J2 cells was significantly downregulated upon ZEN exposure. Furthermore, we found the dose-effect of ZEN on ISLR2 expression. We then overexpressed the ISLR2 gene and observed that overexpression of ISLR2 obviously reduced the effects of ZEN on cell viability, apoptosis rate and oxidative stress level. In addition, ISLR2 overexpression significantly decreased the expression of TNF-alpha and IFN-alpha induced by ZEN. Our findings revealed the effects of ZEN on the ISLR2 gene expression and indicated the ISLR2 gene as a novel regulator of ZEN-induced cytotoxicity, which provides potential molecular targets against ZEN toxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					Accurate 3D printing of thermo-responsive gel inks is a great challenge as the sol-gel transition and rheological properties change during extrusion are not easy to precisely regulate with 3D printing behavior has not been sufficiently studied. The effect of Pleurotus ostreatus protein (POP) correlated with the rheological properties and thermo-responsive behavior of the system on 3D printing performance of the thermo-responsive gel, namely kappa-carrageenan (KG). Afterwards, their interaction mechanism was further clarified and final printed samples were evaluated in terms of antioxidant performance. Results indicated that POP addition increased the gelatinization temperature (Tg), significantly affecting the selection of optimum printing temperature. POP addition also improved viscosity and consistency index (K) of the printing ink, ultimately affecting the extrusion behavior. Temperature recovery property was facilitated by POP incorporation and was critical to the formability during recovery stage in 3D printing. Mechanical strength was improved with POP addition, which played an important role for the printed structures to be self-supportive. A lower concentration of POP (10%~40%) was dispersed in a continuous KG-rich gel network and visible phase separation occurred when POP level was increased to 50%. Molecular interaction analysis showed that electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, ion on the correlation between the rheological properties and thermo-responsive behavior of gum-based 3D printing ink. In addition, POP presented a certain antioxidant activity. This study not only provided useful information on the correlation between the rheological and thermo-responsive behavior of gum-based 3D printing ink, but also provided a way to regulate 3D printing behavior of gum-based gel by protein incorporation. Moreover, it also showed the way to improve the nutritional value of the 3D printed sample.

A novel procedure in combination of genomic sequencing, flow cytometry and routine culturing for confirmation of beer spoilage caused by Pediococcus damnosus in viable but nonculturable state.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Spoilage bacteria had been shown to form viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state maintaining food spoilage capability. In this study, a novel procedure was used to confirm a beer spoilage case caused by a Pediococcus damnosus strain in the VBNC state. Firstly, flow cytometry, routine culturing and PMA-PCR methods were used to identify approximately 103 cells/ml VBNC cells in the spoiled beer sample based on the difference between CFU and viable cell numbers. Secondly, genomic sequencing showed all acquired scaffolds were identical to the genome of P. damnosus with no existence of other species or isolates. In addition, VBNC cells were obtained in both simulation conditions, including beer low temperature storage and subculturing. MRS agar supplemented with catalase was found to resuscitate VBNC cells. Normal, VBNC and resuscitated cells showed similar level of beer spoilage capability. As concluded, a novel procedure, in combination of genomic sequencing, flow cytometry and routine culturing was used to confirm VBNC cells in spoiled beer sample, providing direct evidence on the beer spoilage caused by VBNC P. damnosus cells, and will aid in further study on VBNC state in food industry so that more evidence on food safety problem caused by VBNC microbes will be shown.

J		Zhendan Xue; Tingting Wang; Qing'an Zhang							Effects of ultrasound irradiation on the co-pigmentation of the added caffeic acid and the coloration of the cabernet sauvignon wine during storage.		Foods					In this paper, experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of ultrasound irradiation on the co-pigmentation of caffeic acid added in wine and the coloration of wine during storage. The wine color, chroma, level of the monomeric, combined and polymerized anthocyanins and the concentrations of malvidin-3-O-glucoside and syringic acid in wines were determined by the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, respectively. The results indicate that ultrasound irradiation could definitely affect the color characteristic of wine to a certain extent. Compared with the wine without addition of caffeic acid, the co-pigmentation effects of wine added with caffeic acid could be significantly promoted by ultrasound irradiation, such as the wine color, color density and the polymerized anthocyanins. Furthermore, ultrasound irradiation had a continuous effect on the co-pigmentation of caffeic acid and wine coloration with the extended storage time. In summary, ultrasound could significantly modify the color properties of wine by enhancing the co-pigmentation between caffeic acid and monomeric anthocyanins in the wine, resulting in the improvement of wine quality. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is a non-protein amino acid that possesses various health benefits. In this study, whey protein isolate (WPI)-based films incorporated with GABA at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0% w/v) were characterized for color, water vapor permeability (WVP), microstructure, GABA leachability, and hydration, optical, mechanical and thermal properties. All the tested WPI films exhibited a colorless and transparent appearance. The addition of GABA increased the elongation at break and WVP while decreased tensile strength and light transmittance of the WPI films. The hydration and thermal properties of the WPI films were enhanced when low concentrations of GABA (0.1, 0.5% w/v) were incorporated, but were impaired in the presence of 1.0% (w/v) GABA. This was attributed to the different microstructures of the WPI films at different GABA concentrations. Our findings demonstrated that GABA could be a promising ingredient for improving the physical properties of WPI films.

Food & Function					Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by articular cartilage degeneration, subchondral bone sclerosis, synovial hyperplasia and osteophyte formation as the main pathological manifestations. Age, mechanical stress and inflammation are the main factors that induce joint degeneration in the pathogenesis of OA. Sinensetin (SIN) is a natural flavonoid with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This study aims to investigate the effect of SIN on OA. We have investigated the anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects of SIN on IL-1beta-induced human OA chondrocytes and a rat OA model. In vitro, human chondrocytes were induced by 5 ng mL-1 IL-1beta and treated with different concentrations of SIN. The results suggest that SIN can inhibit IL-1beta-induced overproduction of pro-inflammatory mediators in human OA chondrocytes, including COX2, iNOS, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and also reduce the production of MMP13 and MMP9, thus protecting the degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition, SIN can inhibit the activation of NF-kappaB by regulating the expression of SERPINA3. In an in vivo experiment, rats were randomly divided into 3groups, namely the sham operation group, OA model group and SIN group, and were given normal saline or 20mg kg-1 SIN, respectively. The knee cartilage tissue was removed 6 weeks after surgery for analysis and detection, and our studies have shown that SIN can effectively delay the progression of OA in rats and protect cartilage. In conclusion, our study shows that SIN has good application potential in the treatment of OA. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	19	9973	9987	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01304e					FSTA:2023-02-Aj2047

Food Research International					Yak milk is highly nutritious in terms of abundant protein and fat, whereas little is known regarding the influence and mechanism of heat treatments on its gastric emptying and hydrolysis kinetics during digestion in the human gastrointestinal tract. In this study, a bionic human stomach-intestine system was employed to examine in vitro dynamic gastrointestinal digestion of fresh raw and heated yak milks. During gastric digestion, the formation of protein clots or aggregates was observed for all the milk samples. However, significantly more clots were found from autoclaved milk and raw milk, with a dry weight of 14.1 and 10.9 g from 200 g initial milk sample after 30 min digestion, respectively, compared to pasteurized (6.9 g) and microwaved (9.2 g) milks. For both raw and heated milks, the large-sized coalesced fat globules formed in the stomach were rapidly dissociated to small and uneven droplets upon digestion in the small intestinal conditions due to the highly efficient hydrolysis of milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) proteins and fat globules by pancreatic trypsin and lipase. Due to the formation of more dense-structured clots, a longer gastric emptying half-time was shown for the autoclaved (41.1 min) and raw (38.4 min) milks in comparison to that for the yak milks treated with microwave (34.2 min) and pasteurization (36.2 min). Consistently, the pasteurized milk (92.5 %) exhibited the highest protein digestibility at the end of digestion, followed by microwaved milk (87.8 %) autoclaved milk (86.1 %) > raw milk (80.8 %). The amount of free fatty acids (FFAs) released during digestion in general followed a similar order with that for proteolysis among the milk samples. This study highlights the crucial role of the formation of structured clots in the gastric emptying and hydrolysis of proteins and fat globules. This information will provide a mechanistic understanding of digestion kinetics of yak milk as impacted by heat treatments.

Food Chemistry					Monascus red pigments are widely used in the food industry, mainly as intracellular red pigments. The low yields of extracellular red pigments (ERPs) make them unsuitable for large-scale industrial production. Herein, a novel integrated fermentation system (IFS) consisting of sodium starch octenyl succinate and Triton X-100 was explored for increasing yield, resulting in an ERP yield of 126.7 U/mL, 82.6% higher production than controls (69.4 U/mL). Major ERP components in control fermentations were monascopyridine A and monascopyridine B, but dehydro derivatives, rubropunctamine and monascorubramine, predominated in the test fermentations, presumably due to polyketide oxidation induced by Triton X-100. Improvement of hyphal morphology, membrane permeability, respiratory activity, and gene expression for red pigment biosynthesis is likely to be critical to increase yield and change the compositions. This study provides an effective strategy to accelerate the biosynthesis and secretion of Monascus pigments.

As a result, EULs extracts obtained by DESs had the highest total phenolic content (Choline chloride-Levulinic acid, 73.39mg GAE/g DW) and total flavonoid content (Choline chloride-Triethylene glycol, 147.29mg RE/g DW), much higher than the samples obtained by water and 60% ethanol (w/w). In addition, DESs could effectively extract active compounds from EULs such as chlorogenic acid, rutin, geniposidic acid, and kaempferol. A correlation analysis revealed that lower pH increased the yields of total phenolics, chlorogenic acid, and salicylic acid. The polarity range of 49-50 kcal/mol was universally applicable to active compounds of EULs. Moreover, EULs extracts obtained by DESs exhibited excellent antioxidant activity in vitro. According to the multifactor analysis, the effects of HBD on the active compounds and antioxidant activity of EULs extracts were confirmed, and Choline chloride-Triethylene glycol was the most effective solvent for extracting active compounds from EULs. This study demonstrated the correlation between DESs with different HBD and the active compounds of EULs, providing a valid basis for the design and selection of tailor-made DESs to extract active compounds from EULs.

Journal of Dairy Science					The interactions among the proteins in sheep skim milk (SSM) during heat treatments (67.5-90°C for 0.5-30min) were characterized by the kinetics of the denaturation of the whey proteins and of the association of the denatured whey proteins with casein micelles, and changes in the size and structure of casein micelles. The relationship between the size of the casein micelles and the association of whey proteins with the casein micelles is discussed. The level of denaturation and association with the casein micelles for beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) increased with increasing heating temperature and time; the rates of denaturation and association with the casein micelles were markedly higher for beta-LG than for alpha-LA in the temperature range 80 to 90°C; the Arrhenius critical temperature was 80°C for the denaturation of both beta-LG and alpha-LA. The casein micelle size increased by 7 to 120 nm, depending on the heating temperature and the holding time. For instance, the micelle size (about 293 nm) of SSM heated at 90°C for 30min increased by about 70% compared with that (about 174.6 nm) of unheated SSM. The casein micelle size increased slowly by a maximum of about 65 nm until the level of association of the denatured whey proteins with casein micelles reached 95%, and then increased markedly by a maximum of about 120 nm when the association level was greater than about 95%. The marked increases in casein micelle size in heated SSM were due to aggregation of the casein micelles. Aggregation of the casein micelles and association of whey protein with the micelles occurred simultaneously in SSM during heating.

J		Zheng Wei; Kaizhou Yang; Mimi Guo; Xia Luan; Zhangqun Duan; Xiujuan Li							The effect of thermal pretreatment processing on the distribution of free and bound phenolics in virgin Camellia oleifera seed oil.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of thermal pretreatments on the distribution of free (FP) and bound phenolic (BP) in virgin C. oleifera seed oil, via mixed materials by hot air at 90-150°C for 0-120min before pressing, was investigated, using ultra-performance-liquid-chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass-spectrometry (UPLC Q-TOF MS). In total, 162 components were tentatively identified, consisting of 76 phenolic acids, 33 flavonols, 22 flavones, 12 flavan-3-ols, 11 flavanones, 5 stilbenes and 3 others. The contents of total phenolic profiles ranged from 84.8 to 154.5mg/kg, occupied 43.7-57.8%, 16.5-36.7% and 16.0-26.4% in FP, base-bound (BP-B) and acid-bound phenolic (BP-A), respectively. Gallic acid derivatives of phenolic acids, kaempferol derivatives of flavonols, and dimer of flavan-3-ols were the chief phenolic profiles, but presented dissimilarly in phenolic forms. The PCA suggested in comparison with the control, the distribution of BP-B had a remarkable variation as soon as the heating, and different behaviours occurred at 90°C after 60min and 150°C after 60min in BP-A and FP, respectively. Similarly, prominent differences were discovered for the main contributors among phenolic forms. This novel perspective could be of significance to explore the proper pretreatment processing of virgin C. oleifera seed before oil production.

J		Zheng Xiong; Yaoyao Fu; Jun Yao; Nan Zhang; Rong He; Xingrong Ju; Zhigao Wang							Removal of anti-nutritional factors of rapeseed protein isolate (RPI) and toxicity assessment of RPI.		Food & Function					We prepared a detoxified rapeseed protein isolate (RPI) by phytase/ethanol treatment based on alkaline extraction and acidic precipitation. Contents of protein, fat, ash, moisture, crude fiber, glucosinolates, phytic acid, and phenolics and color were determined. To evaluate the safety of detoxified RPI, five groups of C57 mice (detoxified RPI [10 and 20 g kg-1]; commercial soybean protein isolate (SPI) [10 g kg-1]; non-detoxified RPI [10 g kg-1]; control) were used in the acute-toxicity test. Bodyweight and pathology parameters were recorded at different time points, followed by macroscopic examination, organ-weight measurement and microstructure examination. After pretreatment of rapeseed meals with phytase (enzyme: substrate ratio, 1:5 mg g-1) for 1.5 h and two-time ethanol extraction for precipitated protein, the chemical characteristics in RPI were protein (88.26%), fat (0.57%), ash (2.72%), moisture (1.90%), crude fiber (0.77%), glucosinolates (0 mumol g-1), phytic acid (0.17%), phenolics (0.36%) and whiteness (73.38). Treatment resulted in significant removal of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) and increased whiteness in detoxified RPI compared with non-detoxified RPI, and lower than in cruciferin-rich canola protein isolate (Puratein). Experimental-related effects on bodyweight, clinical observations, or clinicopathology, in mice treated with detoxified RPI were not observed except for a decreased thyroid gland/parathyroid gland index in mice treated with non-detoxified RPI. Furthermore, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) was 10 g kg-1 of detoxified RPI, whereas the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) was the highest fed level of 20 g kg-1 of detoxified RPI. Overall, detoxified RPI prepared by the combined treatment of phytase and ethanol was considered safe under the conditions tested, in which the contents of the main ANFs were reduced significantly. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	2	664	674	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03217h					FSTA:2022-05-Gg2313

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Freshness is an important quality of squid with respect to determining the market price. The methods of evaluation of freshness fail to be widely used as a result of the lack of rapidity and quantitation. In the present study, a rapid and non-destructive quantification of squid freshness by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) spectra combined with chemometric techniques was performed. Results. The relatively linear content change of trimethylamine (TMA-N) and dimethylamine (DMA-N) of squid during storage at 4°C indicated their feasibility as a freshness indicator, as also confirmed by sensory evaluation. The spectral changes were mainly caused by the degradation of proteins and the production of amines by two-dimensional infrared correlation spectroscopy, among which TMA-N, DMA-N and putrescine were the main amines. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) was employed to select the sensitive wavenumbers to freshness for modeling prediction including partial least-squares regression, support vector regression (SVR) and back-propagation artificial neural network. Generally, the SPA-SVR model of the selected characteristic wavenumber showed a higher prediction accuracy for DMA-N (R2P= 0.951; RMSEP= 0.218), whereas both SPA-SVR (R2P= 0.929; RMSEP= 2.602) and Full-SVR (R2P= 0.941; RMSEP= 2.492) models had a higher predictive ability of TMA-N. Conclusion. The results of the present study demonstrate that FTIR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate calibration shows significant potential for the prediction of freshness in squid. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	7	3000	3009	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11640					FSTA:2022-08-Re3180
J		Zheng Zhang; Jia Wei; Man Wang; Jian Zhang; Bin Wu							Induced sulfur metabolism by sulfur dioxide maintains postharvest quality of "Thompson Seedless" grape through increasing sulfite content.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The commercial preservation of table grapes largely depends on the application of sulfur dioxide (SO2). However, little is known about whether SO2 participates in sulfur metabolism to improve the postharvest quality of table grapes. In this study, the contents of sulfur-containing compounds, activities of enzymes, and expression of genes involved in sulfur metabolism in table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Thompson Seedless) were evaluated. Results. The results indicated that SO2 treatment maintained the postharvest quality of table grapes. The sulfite content in rachises and berries, but not the sulfate content, increased in response to SO2 treatment. SO2 caused high activities of sulfite reductase, O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase, and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, thereby increasing the contents of cysteine, hydrogen sulfide, and glutathione in the rachises and berries. The expression of VvSURTL, VvATPS1, VvATPS2, and VvAPR3 decreased in response to SO2 treatment; however, the transcript levels of VvSiR1 and VvOASTL exhibited the opposite tendency. Conclusion. These findings indicated that the sulfite converted from SO2 participated in sulfur metabolism and maintained the postharvest quality of table grapes by modulating the contents of metabolites, activities of enzymes, and expression of genes related to sulfur metabolism. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	3	1174	1184	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11454					FSTA:2022-04-Jg5577
J		Zheng Zhang; Zhonghong Wu; Yuyao Yuan; Jiexian Zhang; Jia Wei; Bin Wu							Sulfur dioxide mitigates oxidative damage by modulating hydrogen peroxide homeostasis in postharvest table grapes.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) burst accelerates the decay and senescence of table grapes. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), a commercial preservative, is known to maintain the postharvest quality of table grapes. However, the mechanism by which SO2 improves postharvest quality is still unclear. In this study, the effects of SO2 on sulfite reduction, the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and the H2O2 receptor during storage were evaluated. The results showed that SO2 not only inhibited decay but also reduced the accumulation of H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA). Compared to the control, SO2 treatment increased the activities of sulfite reductase (SiR), serine acetyltransferase (SAT) and O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase (OASTL), the content of cysteine (Cys) and the expression levels of VvSiR, VvSAT1, VvSAT2 and VvOASTL. Enhancement of critical enzyme activity, gene expression and antioxidant content in the AsA-GSH cycle was observed in SO2-treated grapes. Furthermore, VvGS expression was also determined to be involved in GSH synthesis. SO2 repressed the transcription level of VvHPCA1-4, and VvHPCA3 could be used as a candidate gene to evaluate the degree of oxidative damage in table grapes. These findings suggested that SO2 maintained H2O2 homeostasis to alleviate postharvest oxidative damage by activating sulfite reduction and the AsA-GSH cycle along with inhibiting the expression of VvHPCAs.

J		Zheng-Fei Yan; Shuai Yuan; Qin Qin; Jing Wu							Enhancement of rice protein hydrolysate quality using a novel dual enzyme system.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Currently, the bitterness of rice protein hydrolysates has limited their use as food ingredients or additives. The objectives of the present study were to use dual enzyme hydrolysis to produce rice protein hydrolysates with reduced bitterness and high nutritional value. In this study, Streptomyces canus T20 aminopeptidase (ScAPase) was first expressed in food-grade expression host Bacillus subtilis, obtaining a specific activity of 6217 nkat/mg protein. ScAPase showed high specificity for peptides containing Leu, and Val residues at the N-terminus, indicating that its activity is significantly affected by the nature of the penultimate and antepenultimate residues of substrates. The dual enzyme system involved the synchronous treatment of RPI with trypsin (0.2 g/g RPI) and ScAPase (0.03 g/g RPI) at 50°C for 4 h to produce small peptide-RPI hydrolysates (STRH, 3.37 mg/mL), without any bitterness. Moreover, STRH showed high inhibitory activity of angiotensin-converting enzyme (57.2%) and scavenging activity of radicals, such as ABTS+. (90.1%), O2-. (82.0%), and DPPH (50.8%). Thus, this novel, environmentally friendly dual enzyme system has the great potential to enhance the quality of RPI hydrolysates by enriching small peptides, decreasing bitterness, and producing bioactive peptides.

Food Chemistry					Nowadays, computational approaches have drawn more and more attention when exploring the relationship between sweetness and chemical structure instead of traditional experimental tests. In this work, we proposed a novel multi-layer sweetness evaluation system based on machine learning methods. It can be used to evaluate sweet properties of compounds with different chemical spaces and categories, including natural, artificial, carbohydrate, non-carbohydrate, nutritive and non-nutritive ones, suitable for different application scenarios. Furthermore, it provided quantitative predictions of sweetness. In addition, sweetness-related chemical basis and structure transforming rules were obtained by using molecular cloud and matched molecular pair analysis (MMPA) methods. This work systematically improved the data quality, explored the best machine learning algorithm and molecular characterizing strategy, and finally obtained robust models to establish a multi-layer prediction system. We hope that this study could facilitate food scientists with efficient screening and precise development of high-quality sweeteners.

Food Chemistry					Sanggenone C, oxyresveratrol, catechin and L-epicatechin exist in Morus and Hulless Barley as natural polyphenols with antityrosinase activity. Little research on their synergistic and structure-function relationships of them has been reported in recent years. In this paper, the inhibition mechanisms of these four plant polyphenols were investigated by enzyme kinetics, HPLC, fluorescence spectra, and molecular docking methods. The results showed that oxyresveratrol (IC50 = 1.096 0.048 mug/mL), sanggenone C (IC50 = 13.360 1.029 mug/mL), L-epicatechin (IC50 = 55.730 1.762 mug/mL), and catechin (IC50 = 148.500 3.355 mug/mL) exhibited tyrosinase inhibition activity. When sangenone C (14 mug/mL) was mixed with l-epicatechin (56 mug/mL) at 4:1 (40 muL + 10 muL), the highest tyrosinase inhibition was achieved. Molecular docking showed that the number and position of phenolic hydroxyls of polyphenols were the key for tyrosinase inhibition activity. This study provided new ideas for the application of these four plant polyphenols from Hulless Barley and Morus as tyrosinase inhibitors in food preservation.

Food Chemistry					An accurate hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS) method is presented to characterize starch digestion by alpha-amylase and measure the inhibition properties of flavonoids against alpha-amylase in vitro. Eleven products were found as 1 4 linkage glucose oligosaccharides with different degrees of polymerization (DPs) from 2 to 12. The products with DPs of 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9 had higher yields. The product with DP of 9 had the highest yields, which first increased and then decreased with the reaction time. Pelargonidin has the best inhibition activity on all enzyme products. The 3′-hydroxyl of B-ring enhanced the inhibition activity of flavonol and flavone but weakened that of anthocyanin. The C-ring 3-hydroxyl increased the inhibition effect of flavonol on maltose but decreased that on the products with higher DPs than flavone. The HILIC-MS method can provide more detailed information on enzyme products for the study of flavonoids inhibiting alpha-amylase. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Zhengchao Shen; Xin Ma; Mujahid Ali, M.; Jiang Liang; Zhenxia Du							Analysis of the evolution of potential and free furfural compounds in the production chain of infant formula and risk assessment.		Food Chemistry					Furfural compounds are produced during infant formula production when heat treatment is involved. In this study, a robust method was established for determining potential and free furfural compounds (furfural, 5-methyl-2-furfural, 2-acetylfuran and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural) using a modified QuEChERS technique coupled with GC-MS/MS. Further, 36 samples of two batches, covering the whole infant formula production chain were analyzed by the method to investigate how furfurals evolved during process. Then risk assessment was conducted using the Toxtree and T.E.S.T. Software and evaluated by hazard quotient. Results showed the contents of bound and free 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural demonstrated largest increase during spray-drying (6-11 times) and homogenization stages (12-33 times), respectively. As the sum up of bound and free 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural, potential 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furfural was found can cause safety risks in the production chain due to the high hazard quotient value (3.11), indicating it should be controlled in homogenization and spray-drying stages.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Auricularia auricula is of important nutritional value, although its utilization or consumption are mainly under the original form with no further processing. Indeed, its liquid or other fermented products contribute to improved digestion and absorption of nutrients. Results. The present study used Lactiplantibacillus plantarum to ferment A. auricula juice after an initial processing comprising superfine grinding and high-pressure homogenization. The content of probiotic bacteria in the juice of A. auricula reached 8.48 log colony-forming units mL-1 after 24h of fermentation under 37°C, with the addition of 3% carbon and 0.3% nitrogen source. Meanwhile, the antioxidant activity was increased approximately two-fold, as well as the enriched volatile flavors, both effectively cover up the unwelcoming earthy smell of A. auricula. Furthermore, the storage stability was also strengthened up to 28 days. Conclusion. In summary, the introduced fermentation process not only realized the purpose of improving the nutritional value of A. auricula, but also effectively upgraded the sensory evaluation of A. auricula products. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	12	5172	5180	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11869					FSTA:2022-12-Jq16731
J		Zhengfang Wang; Jager, L. S. de; Begley, T.; Genualdi, S.							Large volume headspace GC/MS analysis for the identification of volatile compounds relating to seafood decomposition.		Food Science & Nutrition					Decomposition in seafood products in the United States is monitored by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) laboratories using sensory testing, which requires highly trained analysts. A large-volume headspace (LVHS) gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) method was developed to generate analytical results that can be directly compared to sensory evaluation. Headspace vapor was withdrawn from a 1-L vial containing 50g seafood sample using a large volume headspace autosampler. Various volatile compounds were collected simultaneously. Analytes were preconcentrated by a capillary column trapping system and then sent through a cryo-focuser mounted onto the GC injector. A selected ion monitoring (SIM) MS acquisition method was used to selectively monitor 38 compounds of interest. Samples of red snapper, croaker, weakfish, mahi-mahi, black tiger shrimp, yellowfin tuna, and sockeye salmon that have been assessed and scored by an FDA National Seafood Sensory Expert (NSSE) were used for method performance evaluation. Characteristic compounds potentially associated with seafood quality deterioration for each seafood species were identified by quantitative analysis using pooled matrix-matched calibrations and two-sample t-test statistical analysis. Classification of fresh and decomposed samples was visualized on the analysis of variance (ANOVA)-principal component analysis (PCA) score plots. The results determined that the LVHS-GC/MS technique appeared promising as a screening tool to identify compounds representative of sensory analysis. © 2022 The Authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) poses a threat to health and compromises the immune system and gut microflora. The present study aimed to explore the effects of rice protein (RP) purified from rice dregs (RD) on acute colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that RP treatment could alleviate the loss of body weight, colon shortening and injury, and the level of disease activity index, repair colonic function (claudin-1, ZO-1 and occludin), regulate inflammatory factors, and restore oxidative balance (malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and total antioxidant capability (T-AOC)) in mice. Also, RP treatment could activate the Kelch-like ECH-associating protein 1 (Keap1)-nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway, mediate the expression of downstream antioxidant protease (NQO-1, HO-1, and Gclc), regulate gut microbiota by enhancing the relative abundance of Akkermansia and increasing the value of F/B, and adjust short-chain fatty acid levels to alleviate DSS-induced colitis in mice. Thus, RP may be an effective therapeutic dietary resource for ulcerative colitis.										2022	70	16	4952	4965	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00585					FSTA:2022-08-Me5012

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Ultrasound-assisted extraction of polysaccharides from squid viscera (SVP) was optimized in this study. The optimal extraction conditions for crude SVP, with a yield of 22.340.26 mg/g, were as follows: ratio of water to raw material, 4.1 mL/g; extraction temperature, 40 °C; and extraction time, 50 min, yielding the predicted result (22.68 mg/g). Subsequently, two fractions, SVP1 and SVP2, were obtained from crude SVP. The chemical characterization and bioactivities of the two SVP fractions were evaluated. The results of three in vitro antioxidant activity assays suggested that SVP2 has higher antioxidant activity than SVP1 in a dose-dependent manner. The effects of SVP2 on H2O2-induced oxidative damage in PC12 cells indicated that SVP2 can protect PC12 cells against oxidative stress via an enzymatic mechanism. In addition, biological assays showed that SVP2 had immunomodulatory activities in RAW264.7 macrophages by stimulating phagocytic activity and the release of cytokines. These results suggest that SVP might be developed as a functional food component. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	6	4615	4629	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01535-7					FSTA:2023-03-Re1131

Food & Function					Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a common nosocomial infection and is an urgent threat to public health. Vancomycin is the preferred antibiotic treatment for CDI but is associated with recurrence. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG is an adjunctive treatment for gastroenteritis and diarrhea and exerts its effects by modulating the immune responses and repairing the intestinal barrier. This study explored the effect of LGG on restoring the intestinal microbiota in mouse models. Primary and recurrent CDI models were constructed, and LGG was administered to C57BL/6mice. Structural changes in the mouse gut microbiota were determined using 16S rRNA gene analysis based on Illumina sequencing. In the CDI model, 6 days after infection, 33.3% mortality, significant weight loss and colonic injury were observed. LGG can ameliorate these events. In the R-CDI mouse model, vancomycin combined with LGG prevented weight loss, improved the histopathological scores, and effectively reduced the mortality. LGG + vancomycin administration promoted the recovery of the intestinal flora by inhibiting Enterococcus and counteracting the side effects of vancomycin treatment. In both the preventive and therapeutic CDI mouse models, the oral LGG strain showed the ability to protect against primary and recurrent infections, indicating that probiotics have potential for treating intestinal diseases. Overall, these observations suggest that LGG can be applied as a preventive treatment for CDI or in combination with antibiotics to reduce recurrence. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	10	5667	5679	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00374k					FSTA:2022-09-Ad16709

The deletion mutant Delta17660 was developed to explore the effects of K2227_17660 in c-di-GMP content regulation, motility, biofilm formation, extracellular protease activity, and spoilage potential by phenotypic and transcriptional comparison with wild-type (WT) strain. Deletion of K2227_17660 significantly increased c-di-GMP content, biofilm biomass, the production of extracellular polysaccharide, trimethylamine (TMA), and putrescine compared with WT strains, and also affected membrane fatty acid composition. Furthermore, RT-qPCR results revealed the expression levels of genes associated with biofilm biomass, spoilage and unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) synthesis changed in a manner consistent with the phenotypes. Our results indicated that K2227_17660 possesses phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that controls the biofilm biomass and spoilage potential of S. putrefaciens. This study provided a basis for a correlation between c-di-GMP and food spoilage in S. putrefaciens, providing new insights into the control of food quality and safety.

J		Zhengkai Yi; Jing Xie							Genomic analysis of two representative strains of Shewanella putrefaciens isolated from bigeye tuna: biofilm and spoilage-associated behavior.		Foods					Shewanella putrefaciens can cause the spoilage of seafood and shorten its shelf life. In this study, both strains of S. putrefaciens (YZ08 and YZ-J) isolated from spoiled bigeye tuna were subjected to in-depth phenotypic and genotypic characterization to better understand their roles in seafood spoilage. The complete genome sequences of strains YZ08 and YZ-J were reported. Unique genes of the two S. putrefaciens strains were identified by pan-genomic analysis. In vitro experiments revealed that YZ08 and YZ-J could adapt to various environmental stresses, including cold-shock temperature, pH, NaCl, and nutrient stresses. YZ08 was better at adapting to NaCl stress, and its genome possessed more NaCl stress-related genes compared with the YZ-J strain. YZ-J was a higher biofilm and exopolysaccharide producer than YZ08 at 4 and 30°C, while YZ08 showed greater motility and enhanced capacity for biogenic amine metabolism, trimethylamine metabolism, and sulfur metabolism compared with YZ-J at both temperatures. That YZ08 produced low biofilm and exopolysaccharide contents and displayed high motility may be associated with the presence of more a greater number of genes encoding chemotaxis-related proteins (cheX) and low expression of the bpfA operon. This study provided novel molecular targets for the development of new antiseptic antisepsis strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhengkai Yi; Jing Xie							Assessment of spoilage potential and amino acids deamination & decarboxylation activities of Shewanella putrefaciens in bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Two Shewanella putrefaciens strains (00A and 00B) were inoculated into sterile bigeye tuna blocks. The biochemical changes (trichloroacetic acid (TCA)-soluble peptides, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), ammonia, trimethylamine (TMA), biogenic amines (BAs), free amino acids (FAA), and total amino acids (TAA)), decarboxylation and deamination activities of S. putrefaciens in bigeye tuna blocks were investigated in this study. All indicators, except for histamine, showed that 00A had a stronger spoilage potential than 00B. The extremely low histamine decarboxylation activities of 00A and 00B may be the main reason for the non-significant difference (p> 0.05) between the two groups in tuna. Meanwhile, arginine deiminase pathway can produce large amounts of putrescine and energy, and arginine deiminase may be the main rate-limiting enzyme of the whole pathway. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed that the difference between TCA-soluble peptide and FAA content in the inoculated groups may be the main reason for the difference in the spoilage potential of the two strains.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Rex rabbits are important fur rabbits. Heat stress severely reduces the fur quality of Rex rabbits. The aim of this study was to experimentally investigate the effect of dietary vitamin A (VA) addition on hair follicle development and related signal pathways in Rex rabbits under heat stress. Results. In the experiment, 90 Rex rabbits were randomly divided into three groups: control group (20-25°C, fed basic diet), heat stress group (30-34°C, fed basic diet), and heat stress+ VA group (20-25°C, fed 12000IU/kg VA in addition to the basic diet). VA could significantly increase the hair follicle density (P<0.01), hair length (P<0.05), and the ratio of secondary to primary hair follicles (P<0.05). In addition, VA could significantly inhibit the expression of BMP2, BMP4, FGF5, TGF-beta1, and miR-214 in heat-stressed Rex rabbits and significantly increase the expression of noggin, IGF1, IGF1R, Wnt10b, CTNNB1, SHH, and miR-203 and the levels of Wnt10b and p-beta-catenin; however, there was no significant effect of VA on the expression of EGF and miR-205. Conclusion. The dietary addition of VA can increase the hair follicle density and fur quality of heat-stressed Rex rabbits. Wnt10/beta-catenin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF5), noggin-BMP, and sonic hedgehog (SHH) signaling were associated with VA regulation under heat stress. It is possible that miR-205 and miR-194 contribute to the regulation of Wnt10/beta-catenin and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	6	2291	2299	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11567					FSTA:2022-07-Sp3354
J		Zhenglei Yang; Yuyang Zhang; Yanwen Wu; Jie Ouyang							The role of drying methods in determining the in vitro digestibility of starch in whole chestnut flour.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Since high temperature facilitates the gelatinization of starch, temperature is generally recognized to play a key factor in the digestibility of starch during the drying process. However, the food matrix is complex and other factors may influence the digestibility of starch in dried whole flour. In this study, the drying temperature varied depending on the drying method used, i.e., freeze drying (-45 °C), natural drying (25 °C), vacuum drying (40 °C), hot-air drying (50 °C) and roasting (200 °C), and a pretreatment with ascorbic acid or salicylic acid was used to produce whole chestnut flour. The estimated glycemic index was higher for hot-air dried and freeze-dried chestnut flour, while that for vacuum-dried, roasted and phenolics-pretreated hot-air dried chestnut flour was lower than that for naturally-dried chestnut flour. During the drying process, the digestibility of starch was correlated with the drying temperature, long- and short-range molecular order, and other compounds in the chestnut.

Food & Function					Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains cause the majority of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and are resistant to various antibiotics. Therefore, it is imperative to explore novel host-target therapies. As a famous food and condiment, garlic (Allium sativum L.) is widely used in medicine, but its exact key targets in UTIs remain elusive. To identify the major active ingredient of garlic and its molecular target against UTIs, a network pharmacology analysis was carried out, and allicin was revealed to be a key active component in garlic acting on UTIs. By molecular docking, allicin showed a good binding affinity to mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein 1 (MALT1). The possible regulatory mechanisms of allicin against UTIs were based on the modules of immune and inflammatory responses mainly through AKT/NF-kappaB signaling. Next, an E. coli-stimulated human uroepithelial cell (HUC) model was established to confirm the anti-infective effect of allicin. The results showed that allicin could significantly inhibit the upregulation of MALT1, the AKT/NF-kappaB pathway, and cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1beta). HUCs pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor or transfected with MALT-siRNA also partly suppressed the activation of the AKT/NF-kappaB pathway and cytokines. Furthermore, by establishing the PCA algorithm to evaluate the therapeutic score, allicin was proved to achieve the optimal therapeutic effects compared with the PI3K inhibitor and siRNA-MALT1. Moreover, in rats with an E. coli-induced UTI model, allicin significantly alleviated the infection and up-regulation of MALT1 expression in the bladders, a marked increase in the bacterial load of urine, and deviations in serum biochemical parameters. In conclusion, allicin exerts anti-infective effects in UTIs mainly via the MALT1/NF-kappaB axis or AKT/NF-kappaB pathway, which provides a theoretical basis for understanding the function of allicin against UTIs and facilitates its clinical application. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	6	3495	3511	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03853b					FSTA:2022-07-Aj11354

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Multi-omics were applied to compare the risks and benefits of ferrous sulfate (FeSO4) and ferrous bisglycinate (FebisGly) in pigs in the current study. The FebisGly group showed reduced triglyceride (TG) and triglyceride/total cholesterol (TG/CHOL) values in the serum and reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased glutathione (GSH) levels in the duodenum. Transcriptome analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes in the duodenum were enriched in oxidative phosphorylation, AMPK, and FOXO signaling pathways between FeSO4 and FebisGly groups. AMPK phosphorylation and FOXO3 protein expressions were significantly increased in the FebisGly group. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed significantly reduced alpha diversity in the FeSO4 group and increased Firmicutes, reduced Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria abundances in the FebisGly group. Targeted metabolome revealed notably increased lithocholic acid (LCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and glycoursodeoxycholic acid (GUDCA) in the FebisGly group. RDA analysis indicated that Fusobacteria was positively correlated with TG and TG/high-density lipoprotein in the FeSO4 group while Christensenellaceae_R-7_group, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-002, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 were positively correlated with UDCA and GLCA in the FebisGly group. According to the current study, FebisGly improves serum lipid metabolism, modulates intestinal antioxidant capacity via the AMPK/FOXO pathway, and reconstitutes gut microbiota and bile acid profiles in pigs.										2022	70	16	4942	4951	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00138					FSTA:2022-08-Aj15326

Food Chemistry					Sugarcane contains various anthocyanins, which are responsible for the colors present in sugarcane. In this study, the color intensification of the major anthocyanin, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, by phenolic acids/aldehydes (ferulic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, syringic aldehyde and vanillic aldehyde) was investigated. The color enhancement of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (hyperchromic effect and bathochromic shift) was affected by the temperature and concentration of phenolic acids/aldehydes present. Reactions were spontaneous and exothermic, as determined using different thermodynamic parameters (DeltaG0, DeltaH0, DeltaS0). Quantum chemical calculations demonstrated their intermolecular interaction differences, and AIM analysis indicated that hydrogen bonds and van der Waals force interactions contributed to color. Pyranoanthocyanins derived from cyanidin-3-O-glucoside and ferulic/p-coumaric acids during storage were recognized as cyanidin-3-O-glucoside-vinylphenol and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside-vinylguaiacol, respectively, by UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. The electron-donating substituents on the aromatic ring of ferulic/p-coumaric acids stabilized the intermediately formed carbenium ion. Decarboxylation and further oxidation of the pyran moieties to the aromatic heterocycles resulted in the final products.

Food & Function					Sea cucumber Stichopus japonicus has been consumed as functional food traditionally in Asia, and its sulfated polysaccharide (SCSPsj) demonstrates health-promoting effects in rodents which are related to the regulation of the gut microbiota. However, little is known about the response of the human gut microbiota to SCSPsj. Therefore, the present study aimed to study the response of the donor microbiota to SCSPsj in vivo through a humanized microbiota mice model, which was constructed by antibiotic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplant. The results revealed that the SCSPsj supplement could positively interact with the specific donor microbiota. It could significantly regulate the gut microbiota community, especially the abundance of Lactobacillus. In addition, SCSPsj could modulate the metabolites in serum and cecal contents of mice, including short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and lactic acid, and the changes of some bioactive metabolites were associated with the gut microbiota enriched by SCSPsj. Furthermore, in vitro experiments demonstrated that the Lactobacillus strains isolated could not be proliferated directly by SCSPsj, but SCSPsj significantly promoted biofilm formation and mucus binding of Lactobacillus spp., which contributed to the enrichment of Lactobacillus in vivo. The present study could provide insight into the application of SCSPsj as microbiota-directed food. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	7	4171	4183	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04443e					FSTA:2022-07-Rg3025

Food Research International					The prevention of obesity is an urgent need for worldwide public health. The scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis) skirt is the by-product of adductor processing. In order to explore the value of the scallop skirt, the present study isolated an acidic polysaccharide from the skirt of P. yessoensis (SPYP) and evaluated its anti-obesity effect. SPYP was characterized as an acidic heteropolysaccharide with a molecular weight of 13.58 kDa. Through stepwise acid hydrolysis followed by HPLC-MSn analysis, two core chains in SPYP was determined as heparin-like 4)beta-GlcA(1 4)alpha-GlcNAc and chondroitin sulfate-like 4)beta-GlcA(1 3)beta-GalNAc . SPYP could effectively reduce body weight, decrease fat accumulation and prevent high blood lipids induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) in mice. Further 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) sequencing analysis revealed that the anti-obesity effect of SPYP was notably associated with its modulation on gut microbiota. The short-chain fatty acids were also restored by SPYP supplementation compared to the HFD group. Moreover, liquid chromatography-high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis demonstrated that metabolite profiles of HFD-fed mice were altered by SPYP supplementation, especially the lipid metabolism in serum and amino acid metabolism in cecal content, which may contribute to the anti-obesity effect of SPYP. The present study offers the basis for processing and application of P. yessoensis skirt.

Food Analytical Methods					A programmed, autonomous, and self-powered DNA motor was developed for one-step amplification detection of ochratoxin A (OTA). The OTA can bind with the aptamer of hairpin and induce the opening of hairpin. Then, the Mg2+-specific DNAzyme can circularly cleave the fluorophore-labeled DNA on the gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), causing autonomous and processive movement of DNA motor. Finally, the cleaved fluorophore-labeled DNA segments can leave from the AuNP surface, causing significant recovery of fluorescent signal. A good linear range was obtained from 0.01 to 5 nM (R2=0.992) with a detection limit of 2 pM. Importantly, this strategy is self-powered and only one-step operation is needed for the whole process. It shows great potential in food security supervision or biological imaging of OTA. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	15	4	847	855	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02169-z					FSTA:2023-01-Cd0151

Degradation of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside induced by antioxidant compounds in model Chinese bayberry wine: kinetic studies and mechanisms.		Food Chemistry					The degradation kinetic of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was determined in combination with different antioxidants, namely ascorbic acid, cysteine, reduced glutathione, and sodium sulfite at different concentrations and temperatures (4, 20, and 37°C) in model Chinese bayberry wine. Ascorbic acid, cysteine, and reduced glutathione accelerated cyanidin-3-O-glucoside degradation; half-life times decreased by ca. 46 ~ 93%, 0.39 ~ 88%, and 1.6 ~ 92% respectively when the concentrations of antioxidants were 0.1 ~ 5 mM. Thiols with more-SH groups lead to faster degradation of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside. Interactions of oxidized cyanidin-3-O-glucoside with antioxidants were evaluated in aqueous solution and methanol to investigate the degradation mechanism of anthocyanin after oxidation. An anthocyanin-cysteine adduct was identified by LC-MS and formation pathways are proposed, along with mechanisms of anthocyanin degradation induced by antioxidants.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					A new efficient magnetic solid-phase extractant based on a surface-modified magnetic mesoporous silica microsphere referred as MMSM-PEI was synthesised and used for the enrichment and isolation of copper ions (Cu2+) in preserved eggs. The physicochemical properties and morphology of MMSM-PEI were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), vibration sample magnetometry (VSM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and thermos-gravimetric analyses (TGA). The concentrations of trace Cu2+ in the preserved egg were determined by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). The effects of important parameters were examined. The most suitable pH values and temperature for adsorbing Cu2+ were 6.5 and 25°C, respectively. According to the determination of Cu2+ in egg white, egg yolk and the outer coating mixture (TOCM) of preserved eggs, the spiked recovery and RSD were 94.1-103.8% and 0.96-4.35%, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 0.14mg/kg and 0.46mg/kg, respectively. The developed method improved the sensitivity and accuracy of FAAS for the determination of Cu2+ and it could be applied to the determination of trace Cu2+ in real samples. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	11	1828	1842	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2022.2119286					FSTA:2023-02-Qa0129

Food Science and Biotechnology					Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is an inducer of inflammation. To elucidate the link of depression of ox-LDL accumulation and anti-inflammatory function of rice protein (RP) whether dependent on methionine availability, growing and adult rats were fed RP and methionine-supplemented RP (RM) under cholesterol-enriched dietary condition. After two weeks feeding, RP and RMs exerted the anti-inflammatory effects through up-regulating IL-10, while RP and RMs significantly reduced ox-LDL levels and effectively suppressed the expressions of inflammatory mediators (COX-2, IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, iNOS). The anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism was to inhibit NF-kappaB activation and to simulate methionine sulfoxide reductase expression. Results showed, under cholesterol-enriched dietary condition, the anti-inflammatory action can be induced by RP and enhanced by methionine in growing and adult rats. The present study reveals a link of the decreased ox-LDL accumulation with the anti-inflammatory function of RP, which is dependent on methionine availability and independent of dietary cholesterol. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2022.										2022	31	6	745	758	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-022-01074-3					FSTA:2022-09-Aj16211
J		Zhengyi Zhang; Mengqi Zeng; Xiao Han; Zhanwu Hou; Zhen Wang; Tian Su; Wei Zhao; Jiankang Liu; Huadong Liu							A nascent protein labeling strategy disclosed mitochondrial proteomic responses in punicalagin intervened insulin resistance of HepG2 cells.		Food & Function					Insulin resistance (IR), as a common pathophysiological basis, is closely related to a variety of metabolic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes. IR is often accompanied by mitochondrial dysfunction which could be induced by a high fat diet. Punicalagin (PU), a natural compound extracted from pomegranate, could ameliorate palmitate-induced IR. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well known. We propose that understanding the proteomic response of mitochondria may help define the mechanisms of PU in the prevention of IR. Most of the mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear genes and transported from cytoplasm. To distinguish newly incorporated proteins responding to stimuli from pre-existing mitochondrial proteome, nascent proteins in HepG2 cells were pulse labeled by an amino acid analog L-azidohomoalanine. Nascent nuclear encoded mitochondrial proteins were enriched by click reaction followed by mass detection. Our data showed that PU increased nuclear encoded protein incorporation to mitochondria in general though the total protein levels remained immobile. To decipher this phenomenon, we tested the protein and mRNA levels of genes related to mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis and found that the mitochondrial turnover was accelerated by PU treatment. By the nascent protein labeling strategy and pathway analysis, we enriched the newly incorporated proteins of mitochondria for responding to PU treatment and found that PU induced nascent protein incorporation into mitochondria and enhanced mitochondrial turnover. These findings demonstrate that PU prevents IR by targeting mitochondria, and thus, is an effective natural nutrient beneficial for mitochondrial turnover. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1180	1191	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02749b					FSTA:2022-06-Aj8829

Food Research International					This study investigated the effect of FBP (fermented blueberry pomace by the mixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Lactobacillus plantarum-1) on hyperlipidemia in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6J obese mice. The results indicated that FBP significantly reduced the weight gain, liver and fat indexes, and hyperlipidemia of HFD mice. Serum TC, TG, and LDL-C in HFD mice were significantly decreased through supplementation with FBP, and serum SOD, GSH-Px, CAT, and T-AOC in H-FBP group were increased by 28.25%, 26.84%, 23.30%, and 19.79%, respectively. Furthermore, FBP reduced the activity of ALT, AST, and LPS; down-regulated the expression of inflammation-related cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6); and improved lipid metabolism by up-regulating PPAR-alpha and down-regulating SREBP-1 and FAS. Thus, FBP alleviated obesity, liver injury, and inflammation caused by a HFD by increasing antioxidant capacity and reducing leptin production, indicating that FBP is a nutrient-rich beverage with the potential to relieve obesity. Generally, this study highlightsed a new use of blueberry pomace. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	157				0963-9969				10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111396					FSTA:2022-10-Hs9560

Food Control					Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a common pathogen that can cause severe foodborne diseases. Therefore, the detection of S. aureus in food has been the focus of attention. In this study, a strategy for the detection of S. aureus using magnetic separation technology combined with colorimetry was proposed. Phenylboronic acid, as a compound that had been widely used in the identification of sugars and sugar-based molecules, can selectively enrich compounds with cis-diol groups through a reversible esterification reaction. Hence, 3-aminophenylboronic acid (APBA) could be used as a recognition molecule to capture bacteria, because there were a large amount of peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria and Gram-negative bacteria. At the same time, there are few studies on the use of APBA as magnetic separation recognition molecule to enrich pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, we prepared APBA-functionalized magnetic beads (APBA-MBs) for pre-enrichment of S. aureus and an APBA-MBs based untargeted magnetic separation was constructed to replace the traditional targeted magnetic separation. In order to realize the output signal and guarantee the specificity for detecting S. aureus, we used HRP-pig IgG because the Fc fragment of IgG could bind the protein A on the cell wall of S. aureus. Finally, the tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) color development solution was occurred the chromogenic reaction under the action of the HRP enzyme. Under the optimal experimental conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) of the APBA-MBs combined with color reaction was 3.0 * 102 CFU/mL in pure culture, fruit juice, pool water and spinach.

Food Chemistry					Although camel milk is increasingly becoming a popular alternative to bovine milk around the world including Australia, studies of Australian camel milk are still lacking. A comprehensive and systematic analysis of major nutritional components, physical properties, antimicrobial enzymes and whey proteomes of Australian camel milk obtained over four seasons was conducted, for the first time in present study. The composition and physical properties of Australian camel milk varied with season, milking frequency and yield. The highest lactoperoxidase and polyamine oxidase activity was observed in summer and winter, respectively. A total of 97 proteins were quantified, on a relative basis, across all the seasonal bulk milk samples. Summer camel milk contained higher amounts of functional whey proteins, such as lactotransferrin, peptidoglycan recognition protein 1, osteopontin and lactoperoxidase. These results contribute to a better understanding of the Australian camel milk and provide insights into processing of dairy products from this milk.

N.; Nidhi Bansal							Digestibility of proteins in camel milk in comparison to bovine and human milk using an in vitro infant gastrointestinal digestion system.		Food Chemistry					The absence of beta-lactoglobulin, high beta-/alphas-casein ratio and protective proteins make camel milk a promising alternative protein base for making human infant formulae. In this study, protein digestibility of camel milk was compared with that of bovine and human milk using an in vitro infant gastrointestinal digestion system. A low degree of gastric proteolysis was observed in all three kinds of milk, and a single clot was formed in camel milk. The soluble milk proteins remaining in the gastric digesta were digested rapidly and extensively in the intestinal phase, while the proteins in the camel milk clot were hydrolysed gradually. Despite several similarities, bioactive peptides unique to individual milk were identified in the three intestinal milk digesta. The results suggest that camel milk proteins are equally digestible as bovine and human milk proteins under infant gastrointestinal digestion conditions, and it may be a prospective substitute for infant formula base.

Shaw; Nidhi Bansal							Physicochemical properties and whey proteomes of camel milk powders produced by different concentration and dehydration processes.		Foods					Camel milk powder production is an alternative to preserve the perishable milk for later-date consumption. However, the impacts of dehydration processes on bioactive compounds in camel milk are largely unknown. Hence, the present study attempted to compare the physicochemical properties and protein profiles of camel milk powders produced by different concentration and dehydration processes. Six camel milk powders were produced by freeze-and spray-drying methods in conjunction with two liquid concentration techniques, namely spray dewatering and reverse osmosis. The results of proteomic analysis showed that direct freeze-dried camel milk powder had the least changes in protein profile, followed by direct spray-dried powder. The camel milk powders that underwent concentration processes had more profound changes in their protein profiles. Among the bioactive proteins identified, lactotransferrin and oxidase/peroxidase had the most significant decreases in concentration following processing. On the contrary, glycosylation-dependent cell adhesion molecule 1, peptidoglycan recognition protein 1, and osteopontin increased in concentration. The results revealed that direct freeze drying was the most ideal method for preserving the bioactive proteins during camel milk powder production. However, the freeze-drying technique has cost and scalability constraints, and the current spray-drying technique needs improvement to better retain the bioactivity of camel milk during powder processing. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhenhui Zhang; Lin Li; Yuting Li; Yi Wu; Xia Zhang; Haiping Qi; Bing Li							Insight on a competitive nucleophilic addition reaction of nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine or different amino acids with 4-methylbenzoquinone.		Foods					omicron-benzoquinone is a common intermediate which is mostly formed by the oxidation of phenolics or polyphenols containing catechol structure. omicron-benzoquinone has an outstanding nucleophilic ability, while advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are nucleophilic and can undergo a nucleophilic addition reaction with omicron-benzoquinone to mitigate the harmful effects of AGEs on the body. As common nucleophilic substances, amino acids existing in large quantities in food processing and in vivo may bind competitively with omicron-benzoquinone, thus influencing the trapping of omicron-benzoquinone with AGEs. In this study, cyclic voltammetry and coexistence experiments were used to compare the reactivities of Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML) and amino acids with 4-methylbenzoquinone (4-MBQ). The results showed that CML is more reactive with omicron-benzoquinone than most amino acids, and even in complex systems, omicron-benzoquinone still captured CML. Moreover, almost all adducts were identified by UPLC-QTOF-MS/MS, and their chemical formulas were deduced. Quantum chemistry accurately predicts the efficiency and site of reactions of omicron-benzoquinone and nucleophiles to a certain extent, and found that a secondary amine has a greater reactivity with 4-MBQ than a primary amine in a similar molecular structure. In general, omicron-benzoquinone could capture AGEs, thereby showing potential to reduce the harmfulness of AGEs. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhenjiang Ding; Qichao Wei; Chunmei Liu; Hong Zhang; Feng Huang							The quality changes and proteomic analysis of cattle muscle postmortem during rigor mortis.		Foods					Rigor mortis occurs in a relatively early postmortem period and is a complex biochemical process in the conversion of muscle to meat. Understanding the quality changes and biomarkers during rigor mortis can provide a theoretical basis for maintaining and improving meat quality. Herein, a tandem mass tag proteomic method is used to investigate the effects of differentially expressed proteins on the meat quality of cattle Longissimus lumborum muscle postmortem (0, 6, and 24 h). The pH, total sulfhydryl content and sarcomere length decrease significantly during storage. In contrast, meat color values (L*, a*, and b*) and the myofibril fragmentation index increase significantly. Altogether, 147 differentially expressed proteins are identified, most being categorized as metabolic enzymes, mitochondrial proteins, necroptosis and ferroptosis proteins and structural proteins. The results also reveal additional proteins that are potentially involved in rigor mortis, such as cardiac phospholamban, acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase, and ankyrin repeat domain 2. The current results provide proteomic insights into the changes in meat quality during rigor mortis. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhenjiang Zhou; Fayin Ye; Lin Lei; Siyuan Zhou; Guohua Zhao							Fabricating low glycaemic index foods: enlightened by the impacts of soluble dietary fibre on starch digestibility.		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. Diabetes mellitus, which is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases, is a major cause of the increase in morbidity and mortality in humans. To relieve hyperglycaemia in diabetic patients, the control of blood glucose levels through the use of a low glycaemic index diet is highly recommended. In view of the predominant contribution of dietary starch to blood glucose, low starch digestibility foods can certainly benefit diabetic patients. Hence, food technologists have attempted to design foods with lowered starch digestibility by using various strategies, and the application of soluble dietary fibre (SDF) has attracted a considerable amount of attention. Scope and approach. This work aimed to present an updated overview of the evidence, factors, and possible mechanisms of the impacts of SDF on starch digestibility. Key findings and conclusions. First, the in vitro, in vivo, and clinical evidence of SDF on starch digestibility was summarized. The SDF-starch digestibility relationship was found to be dependent on the nature of SDF and starch. The former factor included the type, application dose, charge, and molecular weight, and the latter mainly involved the type and physical state. Additionally, the mechanism underlying these concepts was explored, and it was found that SDF functions as follows: 1) the modification of the multiscale structure of starch or the involved food; 2) an increase in the viscosity of intestinal contents; 3) decreases in the activities of amylolytic enzymes; and 4) the regulation of the levels of hormones or other metabolites related to starch digestion. Finally, the perspectives and directions of future efforts were proposed in pursuing a full understanding of the underlying mechanism and more valuable data for designing healthy foods.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Quercetin (Que) has many pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, antioxidant, cardiovascular protection, antihypertensive and lipid-lowering activities. However, its poor water solubility greatly limits its application in medicine and food. gamma-Cyclodextrin metal-organic frameworks (gamma-CD-MOFs) are novel porous carriers for loading functional products. In this study, Que was successfully loaded into gamma-CD-MOFs, and the new compound (Que-CD-MOFs) was characterised by X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Results. The apparent solubility of Que-CD-MOFs was enhanced by 100-fold compared with that of pure Que. The free radical scavenging ability of the encapsulated Que was significantly improved. The cytotoxicity of Que-CD-MOFs to HK-2 cells was decreased, and their inhibition on HT-29 tumour cells was maintained, as confirmed by CCK-8 assays. Flow cytometry of HT-29 cells showed that Que-CD-MOFs can inhibit G2 phase cells. Based on molecular modelling, Que molecules were preferentially located inside the cavities of gamma-CD pairs in gamma-CD-MOFs. Conclusion. gamma-CD-MOFs are promising carriers for bioactive agents in food and pharmaceutical applications. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	9	3887	3896	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11738					FSTA:2022-10-Aj18648

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Whole-food-based strategies to prevent metabolic diseases are growing interests. Agrocybe cylindracea (AC) is a major edible mushroom with high values of nutrition, but little is known about its health benefits as a portion of whole food. Methods and Results. Diet-induced obese, C57BL/6J mice are fed an high-fat diet (HFD) with or without AC (3% or 5%, w/w in the diet) for 9 weeks. The results show that dietary AC reduced body weight, adipose accumulation, impairment of glucose tolerance, lipid levels, and liver injury in HFD-fed mice. Moreover, AC not only prevents HFD-induced gut disorder, as indicates by the enriched probiotic Bifidobacterium and reduced endotoxin-bearing Proteobacteria, but also improve the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level and gut tissue structure. Fecal metabolites such as harmine and harmanine are also remarkably altered by AC. Spearman's correlation analysis reveals that the AC-altered microbes and metabolites are strongly correlated with obesity-related indexes. Conclusion. These findings suggest that dietary AC prevents HFD-induced obesity and its complications in association with modulating gut microbiota and associated fecal metabolites. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	7			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100897					FSTA:2022-07-Jq9725

Food Bioscience					Radio frequency (RF) heating as an emerging technology was applied to regulate the structural, digestive and physicochemical properties of rice starch. In vitro digestibility results showed that RF treatment enhanced the resistant starch content and reduced the rapidly digestible starch content of rice starch, resulting in higher resistant to enzyme hydrolysis. Microstructure analysis indicated that RF treatment caused the granular surface erosions and morphology changes with increasing treatment time. RF treatment did not alter the A-type crystal form of starch, but disrupted the relative crystallinity, short-range molecular order, and lamellar structure in different degrees. Moreover, the DSC results suggested that starch orders with a higher thermal stability formed after RF treatment, thereby reducing the accessibility of starch granules to the enzyme. Furthermore, rapid viscosity analysis revealed that RF treatment significantly reduced the peak viscosity and breakdown of indica and japonica rice starch, while increased them in waxy rice starch. The rheological properties of rice starch were also changed after RF treatment. This work provides a theoretical basis for the application of RF technology in starch modification.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Reducing starch digestibility can be beneficial to control the increasing of postprandial blood glucose and reduce the risk of diabetes, obesity, and other related chronic diseases. In this study, the structure, digestibility and physicochemical properties of rice flour under radio frequency (RF) treatment was investigated. The structural properties of rice flour were characterized by the X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and particle size analyzer. The results showed that RF treatment caused the aggregation of starch granules, resulting in the increase of particle size. The relative crystallinity and the short-range order of rice flour were reduced following RF treatment. In vitro digestibility results showed that the resistant starch content of indica, japonica and waxy rice flour (IRF, JRF and WRF) increased from 39.04% to 42.02%, 39.95%-45.12% and 36.26%-43.61% after RF treatment, respectively. Moreover, RF treatment reduced the peak viscosity and breakdown of IRF and JRF, whereas enhanced them in WRF. After RF treatment, the G′ and G of all samples increased, while the tan delta displayed an opposite trend. These results suggest that RF treatment has the potential to modify rice flour for extending its application range in food industries.

J		Zhenni Li; Shuyuan Fan; Yixin Hong; Ning Li							Improved physicochemical and fermentation properties of frozen dough with bacterial cellulose.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Effects of a novel category of hydrocolloid (Bacterial cellulose, BC) on physicochemical and fermentation properties of frozen dough were studied to address the reduction in baking performance due to refrigeration. The addition of BC reduced free thiol content and inhibited the de-polymerisation degree of glutenin macropolymers, resulting in enhanced emulsifying activities of frozen dough, when the amount was added up to 0.1g 100g-1of wheat flour (dry basis). Further supplement hurt these attributes due to competition for water molecules. However, increasing the addition of BC significantly enhanced its protective effect on yeast activity, which in turn improved the fermentation properties of frozen dough. After 8 weeks of storage at -18°C, 31% of yeast survived in with the protection of BC. When BC was added at a ratio of 0.1g 100g-1 of wheat flour, the improved frozen dough showed maximum volume of gas which was 2.7 times higher than that of the control after 3h of fermentation. Baking performances confirmed the effect of BC as bread crumbs containing intermediate addition of BC rose optimally during proofing and baking, which contributed to the higher specific volume, less firm and more tender crumb texture of bread. These results suggested that BC might act as an effective additive to improve the shelf-life stability of frozen food during long periods of frozen storage. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	8	4763	4771	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15583					FSTA:2022-11-Mq6417

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, core-shell complex biopolymer nanoparticles loaded with curcumin were fabricated using a simple pH-driven method. An aqueous solution containing curcumin, zein, sodium caseinate, and sodium alginate was prepared under a strongly alkaline condition (pH 12) and then acidified (pH 4). This led to the formation of curcumin-loaded complex biopolymer nanoparticles with a hydrophobic core (zein) surrounded by a hydrophilic shell (caseinate-alginate). The nanoparticles formed from beta-D-mannuronic acid residues blocks (MM-blocks) had the smallest hydrodynamic diameter (202 nm), highest encapsulation efficiency (98 g/100 g), and best water-dispersibility. Transmission electron microscopy showed that the complex biopolymer nanoparticles had a core-shell structure. Fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy were used to provide insights into the nature of the molecular hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions within the complex biopolymer nanoparticles. Overall, the curcumin-loaded complex biopolymer nanoparticles fabricated from MM-blocks had the best long-term storage and salt stability. These results may be useful for creating colloidal delivery systems that enhance the dispersibility, stability, and bioactivity of hydrophobic nutraceuticals.

Foods					This study applied peptidomics to investigate potential biomarkers for evaluating pork-meat freshness. The spoilage time points of pork meat stored at -2, 4, 10, and 25°C were defined by evaluating meat freshness indicators (color, total viable count, pH, and total volatile basic nitrogen). Peptide MVHMASKE was identified as a potential peptide marker via multivariate analysis. Pearson correlation revealed a negative correlation between intensity of MVHMASKE and total viable count/total volatile basic nitrogen. In addition, the correlation between peptide content and the change in pork-meat freshness was verified using real-life samples, and the content of MVHMASKE showed a significant decline during storage under 4 and 25°C, correspondingly reflecting the change of pork meat from fresh to spoiled. This study provides favorable evidence to evaluate pork-meat freshness by monitoring the change of peptide MVHMASKE in content based on mass spectrometry-based peptidomics. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of Food Science					Temperature is one of the most important factors for drying edible mushrooms. To evaluate the effects of different hot-air drying (HAD) temperatures on the umami taste and aroma profile of Suillus granulatus (S. granulatus) mushrooms, we measured umami substances and volatile compounds of S. granulatus dried at 40°C, 50°C, 60°C, 70°C, and 80°C. Results showed that when dried at 60°C, S. granulatus exhibited significantly higher (p< 0.05) equivalent umami concentration, taste activity values of glutamic acid (Glu) and 5′-guanosine monophosphate (5′-GMP), and electronic tongue umami sensory scores. The results identified a total of 71 volatile components of which geranylacetone, benzaldehyde, phenylethyl alcohol, and 3-methylbutanoic acid were the dominant compounds. Sensory evaluation and relative odor activity values (ROAVs) revealed that 16 volatile compounds were the key volatile organic compounds contributing mushroom-like and sweet odor to the overall aroma of S. granulatus; these included 1-octen-3-ol (ROAV: 15.11-62.06) and ethyl phenylacetate (ROAV: 13.62-79.11). The drying temperature changed the aroma profile of S. granulatus. Furthermore, the mushroom dried at 60°C had a more desirable mushroom-like and almond odor. It was, therefore, proposed that HAD at 60°C was optimal for retaining a pleasant flavor in S. granulatus. This study provides a theoretical basis for the optimal drying condition selection for the mushroom processing industry. Practical Application. Hot-air drying at 60°C can significantly retain the flavor of S. granulatus and is an optimal temperature for mushroom drying. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	5	1983	1998	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16127					FSTA:2022-08-Jq11446

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Lactiplantibacillus plantarum has often been used for fermentation of lactose-rich substrates. However, its growth in lactose has not been studied at the molecular level and the role of different beta-galactosidases is also unknown. In this study, transcriptome sequencing was performed to reveal the difference of gene expression when Lp. plantarum LP01 was cultivated in glucose and lactose medium. Two genetic loci involved in lactose metabolism were highly transcripted by lactose induction, in which beta-galactosidase coding gene lacA, lacL and lacM were up-regulated by 9.86, 9.12 and 9.53-fold, respectively. To explore the detail role of different beta-galactosidase, mutant strains Lp. plantarum DeltalacA, Lp. plantarum DeltalacLM and Lp. plantarum DeltalacADeltalacLM was constructed by gene knockout. Results showed that the growth of Lp. plantarum DeltalacA was slightly weakened in lactose medium, while the growth of Lp. plantarum DeltalacLM and Lp. Plantarum DeltalacADelta lacLM was completely inhibited. Furthermore, the growth of Lp. plantarum DeltalacLM could be restored after transformed into an complementation vector pNZ8148-PlacLM-lacLM. Therefore, the beta-galactosidase LacLM plays the major role in lactose utilization of Lp. plantarum, providing a theoretical foundation for the growth and metabolism of Lp. plantarum in lactose medium.

Food Science & Nutrition					Magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) strategy based on the Fe3O4@PDA/MIL-101 (Cr) has been proposed to separate and purify five common mycotoxins in licorice, including aflatoxin B1, aflatoxin G1, sterigmatocystin, zearalenone, and ochratoxin A. Integrating the MSPE and solid-liquid extraction/partitioning, a modified QuEChERS was established to adapt to the complex licorice samples. The Fe3O4@PDA/MIL-101 (Cr) was successfully synthesized and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and nitrogen adsorption-desorption isotherms. Sorbents with superior advantages for exclusion of matrix interference and extraction of target analytes in a short time were obtained, according to their ability of magnetic separation, high surface area (287.75 m2/g), large pore volume (0.61 cm3/g), and nanosized structure with mesopores. Prior to analysis with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), several key parameters that would affect the sorbents' extraction efficiency were extensively investigated. Under the optimized conditions, the practicality of the developed method for analysis of mycotoxins in licorice samples was confirmed by adequate linearity (R2 ≥ 0.9967), high sensitivity (LODs and LOQs, respectively, in the ranges 0.01-0.09 and 0.02-0.30 mug/kg), acceptable recovery (78.53%-116.28%), satisfactory reusability, and good interbatch precision of the sorbents (RSDs in the ranges 6.70%-11.20% and 6.02%-10.35%, respectively). The results indicated that the established method was feasible and reliable for the environment-friendly and rapid screening of mycotoxins in complex licorice samples. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Analytical Methods					Biological activities of limonoid include antitumor, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, etc., and its content in citrus seeds is particularly high with a low utilization rate, so it is an important potential source of limonoid. The miniature near-infrared spectra device provides a high-throughput, low-cost, and field analysis technique for the detection of limonoid from it. In this paper, the quantitative determination of limonin, nomilin, and obacunone in citrus seeds by a NIR instrument, and a precise benchtop NIR instrument were studied. UHPLC-MS/MS was applied as the reference analysis method. The root mean square error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2), and the ratio of performance to deviation (RPD) were used to monitor the model. R2p, RPD, and RMSEp of the best model based on benchtop TANGO FT-NIR for limonin, nomilin, and obacunone were 0.8920/3.10/0.0141, 0.9250/3.72/0.0058, and 0.9081/3.36/0.0040, respectively, representing reliable results. The miniature device NIR-S-G1 was also good in the model for nomilin (0.9075/3.35/0.0097) and obacunone (0.8860/3.02/0.0050). This result indicated that the miniaturized NIR-S-G1 has a similar ability to TANGO FT-NIR in detecting nomilin and obacunone in citrus seeds. Their experimental NIR absorption was detected to better understand the characteristics of the model. This step, combined with the waveband selection algorithm and the two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) analysis, explained the main factor that affects the difference in analytical performance between the two spectrometers: detection range and instrument resolution.

Three-dimensional (3D) printability assessment of food-ink systems with superfine ground white common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) protein based on different 3D food printers.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology is innovatively used in creating customized healthy food for different population groups. This study provided two appropriate food-ink systems with common bean protein extract (CBPE) for the syringe-based 3D food printer (0.5 g of sodium alginate, 6 g of gelatin, and 40 g of CBPE in 100 mL of water) and the gear-based 3D food printer (3.5 g of agar, 0.05 g of xanthan, and 12 g of CBPE in 100 mL of water), respectively. Superfine grinding significantly (p< 0.05) decreased the particle size of CBPE and resulted in a reduction in the printability mainly through increasing (p< 0.05) the adhesiveness and the swell powder of food-ink systems, respectively for the syringe-based 3D food printer and the gear-based 3D food printer. The decrease in the stability of printed products by the syringe-based 3D food printer was mainly due to the reduced water binding capacity (p< 0.05) by superfine grinding. Besides, the syringe-based 3D food printer was more suitable for printing CBPE based foods due to its weaker effects on the alpha-AI activity (p< 0.05). These findings were expected to provide new ideas for the potential application of white common bean protein in 3D food printing technology.

Food Chemistry					The health effects of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) in drinking water drew great attention recently. Herein, by using in vitro (fluorescence quenching, UV absorbance, circular dichroism) and in silico (molecular docking) method, binding interactions of two halophenolic DBPs (2,4,6-trichlorophenol [TCP] and 2,4,6-tribromophenol [TBP]) with human serum albumin (HSA) and the influence of hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPCD) on the interactions were investigated. TCP/TBP could form complexes with HSA mainly by hydrogen bonding, while changing its secondary structure, among which TBP showed more influential effect. Interestingly, the binding constants for halophenol-HSA complexes decreased obviously with the involvement of HPCD. Molecular docking results revealed that HPCD could include TCP/TBP into its cavity and change their original binding sites from subdomain IB to IIA, resulting in a more stable binding system. These findings are beneficial for understanding the toxicity of halophenols inside the human body and indicated that HPCD could be a promising detoxication agent for DBPs.

In situ assays demonstrated that fumigation with PEO significantly reduced and retarded the growth of A. flavus in stored rice seeds but the germination rate decreased with increasing concentration of PEO. PEO could alleviate rice seeds' color differences by reducing the degree of rice seeds browning, as evidenced by a decrease in polyphenol oxidase in PEO-fumigated rice seeds. Moreover, the rice seeds with PEO fumigation exhibited higher soluble protein content and catalase (CAT) activity, which collectively suggests that PEO promotes the tolerance of rice seeds to A. flavus. Furthermore, decreases in fatty acid value (FAV), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and acceptable sensorial characteristics were observed in the rice seeds after PEO fumigation, indicating that fumigation with PEO can effectively delay the trend of quality deterioration in high moisture rice seeds during storage. These results recommended PEO as a potential green preservative for the shelf-life extension of stored grain.

J		Zhenyang Hu; Chen Lu; Yushen Zhang; Wenjun Tong; Lihui Du; Fang Liu							Proteomic analysis of Aspergillus flavus reveals the antifungal action of Perilla frutescens essential oil by interfering with energy metabolism and defense function.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Perilla frutescens essential oil (PEO) has been widely used as a food preservative. This study aimed to clarify the mechanism of PEO against Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) at the protein level by using TMT proteomics. Marked changes in polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids of A. flavus were observed after treatment with PEO. Disordered energy metabolism and damaged defense function occurred in PEO-treated A. flavus. Proteomic analysis further manifested that PEO inhibited the growth of A. flavus by blocking the antioxidative defense process and glycolysis pathway. Moreover, additional energy-producing pathways of A. flavus were activated to compensate for the unbalanced glycolysis after PEO treatment. Meanwhile, the upregulation of enzymes related to RNA transcription and translation might be a protective response to the decreased content of proteins caused by PEO. These results suggest that PEO could potentially be developed as an alternative agent to prevent fungal and aflatoxin contaminations of cereals caused by A. flavus.

Food Hydrocolloids					Microcapsule colloidal systems have been widely used as delivery vehicles. Natural biopolymers are highly biocompatible shell materials for the fabrication of microcapsules, but no single substance can fulfill the requirements of aqueous two-phase interfacial assembly. In this study, we fabricated pectin-chitosan-collagen composite microcapsules (PCCMs) in an aqueous two-phase system to improve the robustness and sustained-release capacity of resultant microcapsules. Fourier transform infrared spectra and isothermal titration calorimetry thermodynamics analysis indicated that the PCCM interface can be stabilized by pectin, chitosan, and collagen via intermolecular electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The swelling experiment and atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements demonstrated that the PCCMs had excellent anti-swelling performance and enhanced mechanical strength of the composite interfacial membrane. Contraction-recovery measurements and scanning electron microscopy indicated that the PCCMs exhibited prominent anti-shrinkage capacity and restorable surface smoothness. The release kinetics of encapsulated substances under conditions of different osmotic pressure and salt concentrations revealed that the PCCMs had superior sustained-release capacity. This study yielded natural, biocompatible, and robust aqueous two-phase microcapsules for encapsulation and delivery of active biomacromolecules.

European Food Research and Technology					The rumen of ruminants contains a variety of fungi with function of producing xylanases to break down plant cell walls. In this study, a new glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) xylanase gene ArXyn10c20 from anaerobic rumen microorganism Anaeromyces robustus was successfully synthesized and expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115, with a protein molecular weight of approximately 42 kDa. The optimum pH and temperature for ArXyn10c20 were 5.5 and 40°C. ArXyn10c20 was stable in the pH range 5.0-9.0, retaining over 75.0% relative activity for 1 h. The activity of recombinant xylanase was significantly enhanced by 1mM Cu2+. The products of ArXyn10c20 hydrolysis of beechwood xylan were xylobiose, xylotriose and xylotetraose by thin-layer chromatography analysis. In food applications, ArXyn10c20 can significantly improve the quality of dough and bread. With the addition of 420 U of ArXyn10c20 per 100g flour, the hardness, gumminess and chewiness of the bread decreased by 42.2%, 45.3%, and 55.4%, respectively, and the reducing sugar increased by 18.7%. The new discovered xylanase ArXyn10c20 has great potential in food industry. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	9	2311	2324	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-04047-2					FSTA:2022-11-Mn6698

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The fusarium toxin 2-amino-14,16-dimethyloctadecan-3-ol (2-AOD-3-ol) is characterized as a sphingolipid analogue that can be isolated from Fusarium avenaceum-infected crops and fruits. In the current study, we discovered a group of novel metabolites of 2-AOD-3-ol from the F. avenaceum-fermented rice culture. 2-AOD-3-ol was predominantly present as a C16:1 fatty acid-assembled ceramide-mimic form rather than as a free base. Although 2-AOD-3-ol and its fatty acyl derivatives were barely detected in fresh samples, the contents of these fusarium toxins accumulated with the extension of storage time up to approximately 32-50 mg/kg dry weight in naturally stored rice, grapes, apples, and oranges. Our finding provides insight into the quality and safety of food during storage through a novel aspect: the C14-C24 fatty acyl 2-AOD-3-ol in nature, which calls for further studies to address their potential impact on human health.										2022	70	16	5151	5158	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c08065					FSTA:2022-08-Cd2718

Food Research International					Glycine betaine (GB) has been reported to mitigate chilling injury of peach fruit during postharvest cold storage, but the effects of GB treatment on changes of fruit flavor and amino acid metabolism remain unclear. In this study, the changes of organic acids and amino acids in peach fruit treated with GB were analyzed through physiological and metabolomic methods. The results manifested that GB treatment reduced internal browning index and maintained higher contents of total soluble solids, titratable acidity, organic acids and total free amino acids. Electronic tongue analysis exhibited separation between GB-treated and control fruit. Additionally, GB treatment increased proline, polyamines and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) contents by higher enzyme activities and upregulated gene expressions of arginine metabolism, GABA shunt pathway and lower enzyme activities and downregulated gene expressions of polyamine degradation pathway. Thus, GB treatment could enhance flavor quality and cold tolerance of peach fruit during low temperature storage.

J		Zhenyu Liao; Dongli Cao; Zhibin Gao							Monitoring and risk assessment of perchlorate in tea samples produced in China.		Food Research International					Accumulation of potentially perchlorate in tea is a new concern for tea consumers. The information on perchlorate contamination in tea is highly limited. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence and accumulation of perchlorate in tea samples from China and to assess human exposure risks. A total of 288 tea samples collected from 16 provinces of China were tested, and nearly 94.8% of the samples were found to have detectable perchlorate contamination. Concentrations of perchlorate ranged from below LOQ to 1274.3mug/kg, with a mean value of 294.6mug/kg. Tea samples collected from Central China had the highest mean perchlorate concentration (403.4 g/kg). The mean and median perchlorate levels in the dark and black samples were much higher than that of other types of tea samples. After brewing tea, the dissolution rates of perchlorate from the dried tea ranged from 58.9% to 89.2%. For the worst-case scenario, the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of tea samples in 16 investigated provinces ranged from 25.9 to 157.8 ng/kg bw/day and 29.7-180.7 ng/kg bw/day for male and female respectively, indicating no significant health risks to local residents via tea consumption.

J		Zhenyu Liu; Yongxia Fu; Fan Zhang; Qingyu Zhao; Yong Xue; Jinrong Hu; Qun Shen							Comparison of the molecular structure of heat and pressure-treated corn starch based on experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and heating on the molecular structure of corn starch were firstly studied using classical experimental methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Heat-treated (HT) starches showed more amorphous content further than pressure-treated (PT) starches at similar DGs, further confirming that a higher level of gelatinization occurred after heating. Compared with PT starches, longer external B2 and B3 chains (DP > 25) degraded more into A chains (DP 6-12) in HT samples at a similar degree of gelatinization (DG). Heating increased the breakage of alpha-1,4-glycosidic bonds and significantly reduced molecular weights even one third of the native corn starch at 100% DG. On the other hand, MD results showed that HHP triggered a greater number of amylose-water inter-molecular hydrogen bonds which agreed well with the higher the freedom degree of water molecules in PT starches. Regarding to various energy changes, PT starches exhibited lower bonding-related energies, but higher Van der Waals and electrostatic forces than HT ones. This study adds to understanding of the different molecular features of heating and HHP gelatinization and provides a molecular tool to assist the starch industry in selecting better modification parameters.

J		Zhenyu Wang; Yue Zhang; Haiyan Xu; Chao Chu; Jing Wang; Xinan Jiao; Qiuchun Li							Whole-genome sequencing analysis reveals pig as the main reservoir for persistent evolution of Salmonella enterica serovar Rissen causing human salmonellosis.		Food Research International					Salmonella enterica serovar Rissen is recognized as one of the most common serotypes in pigs and pig products in many countries and can be transmitted to human through the consumption of contaminated food. To reveal the genetic characteristics of S. Rissen, 39 isolates from human and animal food were subjected to whole-genome sequencing analysis combined with 337 genome sequences downloaded from the NCBI Assembly database. Core genome single nucleotide polymorphism (cgSNP) divided these S. Rissen isolates into two clusters, of which cluster A included 78.3% of American isolates, while cluster B was mainly composed of isolates from China, Asia, and the UK. The 39 S. Rissen isolates located in cluster B were further divided into two subclusters with cluster B-1 of 26 isolates from both humans and food, while cluster B-2 consisted of 13 isolates from animal food, mainly pork. CRISPR typing and cgMLST of the 39 isolates showed perfect correspondence to cgSNP results of their phylogenetic relationship. Virulence factors analysis revealed that ABZJ_0085 and ABZJ_0086 genes presenting in cluster B-2 were lost in cluster B-1. Additionally, antimicrobial resistance gene profiles showed qnrS1, cmlA1, and tet(M) could be detected in cluster B-2 other than cluster B-1. The findings of the divergent difference between cluster B-1 and cluster B-2 demonstrated that S. Rissen was continuously evolved through the pork production chain. In conclusion, pigs are the main reservoir for S. Rissen capable of causing human nontyphoid salmonellosis.

J		Zhenyu Yang; Lei Dai; Qingjie Sun; Mcclements, D. J.; Xingfeng Xu							Effect of molecular weight on the interfacial and emulsifying characteristics of rice glutelin hydrolysates.		Food Hydrocolloids					Previously, it has been shown that rice glutelin with a degree of hydrolysis of 2% (DH2) can form stable oil-in-water emulsions, but the stabilization mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, the molecular, interfacial, and emulsifying properties of DH2 were investigated to better understand the structure-function relationships of this emulsifier. Peptides with relatively small (<5 kDa), medium (5-10 kDa), and large (>10 kDa) molecular weights were separated from DH2 by ultrafiltration. The large and medium peptides exhibited the highest surface hydrophobicity and intrinsic fluorescence intensity, respectively. Dynamic interfacial tension and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) analysis was utilized to characterize the interfacial properties. The large peptides exhibited a faster adsorption rate and a greater reduction in interfacial tension than the others. QCM-D indicated that the properties of the interfacial layers formed by the peptides were different during adsorption or desorption for all samples. The properties of the emulsions formed using the different peptides were characterized by confocal laser scanning microscopy, particle size, flocculation index, and coalescence index analysis. The storage stability of the emulsions increased as the molecular weight of the peptides used to coat the oil droplets increased, which may have been due to an increase in the steric repulsion caused by thicker interfacial layers. These results indicate that the large peptides in DH2 play the most important role in forming and stabilizing emulsions. This knowledge may be used to increase the utilization of hydrolyzed rice proteins as plant-based emulsifiers in foods and beverages.

Journal of Functional Foods					Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a malignant cancer and lacks ideal drugs. Aged citrus peel (Chenpi, CP) is an easily available traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) with potential anticancer effects. Network pharmacology were used to investigate the potential mechanisms of CP in OSCC. Tangeretin was the most crucial active ingredient in CP, as shown by the establishment of the component-target-disease network (C-T-D). Protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and survival analysis showed that PIK3R1, ESR1, and CDK1 are core genes. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PI3K-AKT is the top essential pathways. Molecular docking was used to predict the binding of targets and compounds. In vitro experiments showed that tangeretin inhibits cell proliferation, blocks the cell cycle in S phase, induces apoptosis, regulates core gene expression in SCC25 cells, and has lower toxicity to HOK cells. In conclusion, our study lays the foundation for the use of CP in the treatment of OSCC.

J		Zhenzhen Deng; Jing Wang; Ning Wu; Lihua Geng; Quanbin Zhang; Yang Yue							Co-activating the AMPK signaling axis by low molecular weight fucoidan LF2 and fucoxanthin improves the HFD-induced metabolic syndrome in mice.		Journal of Functional Foods					Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a pathological condition characterized by multiple metabolic abnormalities. With the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes, MetS needs more urgent treatments and interventions. Fucoxanthin (FX) and fucoidan are two important active components derived from brown algae, which have been recommended as adjunctive therapy for MetS. In this study, we found that FX and low molecular weight fucoidan fraction LF2 improved insulin resistance (IR) and enhanced insulin sensitivity in high fat diet (HFD)-induced MetS mice synergistically. LF2 and FX could ameliorate HFD-induced liver injury by reducing liver fat deposition, inflammatory response and oxidative stress. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling axis is a key target for LF2 and FX to improve MetS. FX and LF2 reduced adipogenesis and conversion through co-activation of AMPK and reduction of the expression of adipogenic differentiation factors. In addition, FX up-regulated the expression of uncoupling protein (UCP-1) and promoted the body's energy expenditure. However, LF2 did not significantly increase the anti-hyperlipidemic effect of FX. Collectively, this study elucidated the synergistic improvement of MetS by FX and LF2 from a molecular perspective. It also demonstrated the potential of fucoxanthin combined with fucoidan as an anti-MetS functional food.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Starch retrogradation and moisture migration of boiled wheat noodles (BWNs) result in quality deterioration and short shelf life. The objective of this research was to investigate whether konjac glucomannan (KGM) could improve the quality of BWNs and further establish the shelf-life prediction model. Results. The moisture distribution, recrystallization, and thermal properties of BWNs during refrigerated or ambient temperature storage were determined. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance data showed that KGM addition induced left-shifts of T21 and T22 values, indicating that KGM limited the mobility of bound and immobile water among noodle matrices. X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that KGM did not change the crystal patterns of BWNs but could inhibit the starch recrystallization after refrigerated storage. The Tp and Delta H values of retrograded samples notably (P<0.05) decreased with the increase of KGM addition, suggesting the hinderance of starch retrogradation behavior by KGM. The shelf life of BWNs was predicted by accelerated storage test combined with the Arrhenius equation. The present data displayed that the predicted shelf life of vacuum-packed and sterilized BWNs with 10 gkg-1 KGM at 25 °C was 733days, 2.4-fold that of the control group. Conclusion. BWNs with KGM addition could inhibit starch retrogradation and improve the storage stability, consequently promoting noodle quality. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	2	644	652	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11393					FSTA:2022-03-Mq1748

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Although traditional fermented noodles possess high eating quality, it is difficult to realize large-scale industrialization as a result of the complexity of spontaneous fermentation. In present study, commercial Lactobacillus plantarum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae were applied in the preparation of fermented noodles. Results. The changes in the structural characteristics and aroma components of noodles after fermentation were investigated via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), low-field magenetic resonance imaging, electronic nose, and simultaneous distillation and extraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. SEM images revealed that co-fermentation of the L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae for 10-40min enhanced the continuity of the gluten network and promoted the formation of pores. FTIR spectra analysis showed that the co-fermentation increased significantly (P< 0.05) the proportion of alpha-helices of noodles gluten protein, enhancing the orderliness of the molecular structure of protein. After fermentation for 10-40min, the signal density of hydrogen protons increased from the surface to the core, indicating that the water in the noodles migrated inward during a short fermentation process. The results of multivariate statistical analysis demonstrated that the main aroma differences between unfermented and fermented noodles were mainly in hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds and inorganic sulfides. GC-MS analysis indicated that the main volatile compounds detected were 2,4-di-tert-butylphenol, bis (2-ethylhexyl) adipate, butyl acetate, dibutyl phthalate, dioctyl terephthalate, bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, pentanol and 2-pentylfuran, etc. Conclusion. Co-fermentation with L. plantarum and S. cerevisiae improved the structure of gluten network and imparted more desirable volatile components to wheat noodles. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4697	4706	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11830					FSTA:2022-11-Mq6462

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study aims to fabricate mineral-loading nanocarriers using natural materials. The interaction patterns between ovalbumin (OVA) and four water-soluble polyphenols, namely ferulic acid (FA), (-)-Epigallo-catechin 3-gallate (EGCG), gallic acid (GA) and epicatechin (EC), were investigated. Results showed that the optimised conditions for preparing stable OVA-polyphenol complexes are at the OVA-polyphenol ratio of 4:1 at pH 6, under which OVA-FA and OVA-EGCG showed the highest stability and mineral-loading capacity among four OVA-polyphenol complexes. The fluorescence results indicated that the addition of EGCG and FA induced a significant fluorescence quenching to OVA. The interaction between OVA and polyphenols involved hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis suggested that both FA and EGCG enhanced the stability and orderliness of the structure of OVA. The transmission electron microscopy images also exhibited the spherical structure of OVA after the addition of FA and EGCG. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive X-ray spectrum results suggested that OVA-FA and OVA-EGCG complexes were better mineral carriers than OVA-GA and OVA-EC. This study may serve as the theoretical support for the promising application of OVA in the fabrication of mineral-loading nanocarriers in functional food and pharmaceutic. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	5	3060	3068	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15634					FSTA:2022-08-Ac13229

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Food consumption is a significant exposure route to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The concentrations of 27 PFAS in fast food were determined by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry. In ice cream, instant noodles, and bubble tea, some PFAS were detected, among which perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluoro-n-butanoic acid, and 6:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate monoester showed relatively high concentrations. PFAS migrating from bubble tea cups to the food simulant of 50% ethanol aqueous solution showed a difference compared with those migrating into bubble tea matrices. The migration of 27 PFAS to bubble tea samples indicated that long storage time increased PFAS levels (up to 4.8 times) and so did high storage temperature (up to 7.3 times). The hazard ratio, defined as the ratio of the estimated daily intake and the reference dose, was calculated, and it suggests that the total PFAS exposure risk due to consumption of bubble tea should be of concern.										2022	70	35	10836	10846	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c01434					FSTA:2023-01-Cf0191
J		Zhenzhen Wei; Zhenhua Duan; Xiaoxian Tang; Yanting Qin; Siyun Zhou; Weiwen Duan; Yan Liu							Effects of microwave drying on nutrient component and antioxidant activity of persimmon slices.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The impact of drying on the nutritional compositions of products is one of the crucial issues restricting the advance of food quality, but there has been a lack of systematic research on the variation characteristics of nutritional components of persimmon during microwave drying. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of microwave power, slice thickness and loading amount on the content of vitamin C (VC), total sugar (TS), total acid (TA), soluble tannin (ST), total phenol (TP) and antioxidant activity (AA) of persimmon slices. The results demonstrated that with the rise of microwave power, the VC and TA of persimmon slices initially increased and then decreased, and reached the maximum at 280 W, which were 47.0mg/100g and 2.9g/kg, respectively. However, the TS, ST, TP and AA improved substantially with the elevation of microwave power. As the slice thickness increased, VC firstly increased and then decreased, and peaked when the thickness was 2.0cm, whereas the TS and TA decreased at first and then increased. The content of TS and TA was found to be the lowest at the thickness of 1.5cm, which was only 36.3% and 2.8g/kg, respectively. Otherwise, the ST, TP and AA of persimmon also decreased at first and then increased with the increase of thickness, the 2.0cm treatment was noticeably lower than other treatments. When loading capacity enhanced, VC and TS initially increased and then decreased, and illustrated the highest content as the load was 1.9kg/m2, while the TA exhibited the opposite trend and yielded the minimum as the load was 1.6kg/m2. Furthermore, an increasing load led to the remarkable decline of the contents of ST, TP and AA. In conclusion, drying at the microwave power level of 280 W, the thickness of the slice of 2.0-3.0cm and the loading capacity of 1.6-1.9kg/m2 allowed better retention of VC, TS and TA. Besides, the higher contents of ST, TP and AA of the dried samples were observed at the microwave power level of 420 W, the thickness of the slice of 1.0-1.5cm or 2.5-3.0cm, and the loading capacity of 1.0kg/m2. Above research results would provide theoretical reference for the development of the microwave drying process of persimmon slices. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	16	2	1744	1753	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01273-2					FSTA:2022-12-Jg17087

After modification with 0.1 mL of 0.001% (m:v) sodium diethyldithiocarbamate, a C18 microcolumn retained Hg2+ and MetHg in rice extract within 3 min; the captured Hg species were separated within 12 min in 0.25% (v:v) 2-mercaptoethanol+ 60 mmol L-1 (m:v) ammonium acetate+ 4% (v:v) acetonitrile. Under optimized conditions, the detection limits were 0.3 ng L-1 for Hg2+ and 0.2 ng L-1 for MetHg, respectively, with 10 mL injection vs. 0.1 mL eluent; in-line SPE achieved ~ 100x enrichment. Method precision and accuracy were satisfactory at < 2% relative standard deviations (RSDs) for 20 ng L-1 of Hg2+ and MetHg and 95-102% recoveries for real rice samples.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region is an arid and semi-arid region with low rainfall and strong sunlight; thus, grape berries in this region accumulate sugar content rapidly, and the ripening process is shorter than that in other regions. Although previous studies illustrated that altered sunlight conditions could influence the aroma profiles of grape berries, less attention has been paid to the effect of vine top shading on volatile compounds under a dry-hot climate. RESULT: We focused on the effects of vine top shading on the concentrations of linolenic and linoleic acids, as well as their metabolites, the C6/C9 compounds, in grape berries. Four vine top shading treatments at veraison (ripening onset) and post-veraison (skin full coloration) were performed by reducing solar exposure to the grapevines by 20% and 50% respectively. Apart from (E)-2-hexenal in the 20% shading treatment of 2016, (E)-2-hexenal were not promoted by the 50% shading and 20% shading treatments during veraison to harvest in both of the vintages. By contrast, the influence of vine top shading from post-veraison till harvest was different between the two vintages; these C6 compounds were decreased in both of the shading treatments in 2016, whereas most of them were promoted in 2017, possibly related to daily sunshine hours in this period. In addition, the C9 compound nonanal with very low concentration exhibits a significant difference among various treatments by two-factor analysis of variance. As for linolenic acid and linoleic acid, two types of C6 compound biosynthetic precursors, four shading treatments all reduced their concentration, except for linolenic acid in the 50% shading treatment of 2016. Moreover, it appeared to have no apparent correlation between the variations of two precursors and their volatile metabolites, indicating that there is a complex impact of vine shading on C6 compound biosynthesis. Conclusion. Vine top shading at veraison can reduce the accumulation of some C6 compounds in grape berries, but no consistent consequence was attained for the vine shading at pre-veraison. The findings indicate the significance of grapevine solar exposure management at veraison in controlling the level of C6 compounds in a dry-hot region like Xinjiang. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	5	1862	1871	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11522					FSTA:2022-06-Jg8111
J		Zhenzhen Zhang; Xiaoyu Chen; Xinshuo Liu; Wei Liu; Qiannan Liu; Junrong Huang; Liang Zhang; Honghai Hu							Effect of salt ions on mixed gels of wheat gluten protein and potato isolate protein.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of different concentrations of sodium chloride and calcium chloride on mixed gels comprising wheat gluten (WG) protein and potato protein isolate (PPI) were investigated in this study by measuring texture properties, water holding capacity, rheological properties, hydrophobicity, secondary structure, and microstructure. The objective of the experiments was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effect of salt ions on mixed gels and to understand the effect of substituting sodium ions in food applications. The results showed, with the amount of calcium chloride increased from 0 g/mL to 0.004 g/mL or the amount of sodium chloride increased from 0 g/mL to 0.001 g/mL, the water holding capacity, texture properties, alpha-helix and beta-sheet of the WG/PPI gel system increased, but the hydrophobicity and the beta-turn decreased concurrently. Furthermore, the scanning electron microscopy showed that the three-dimensional structure tended to be stable. Nevertheless, if the concentration of added ions was increased any further, the opposite tendency was observed. The results indicated that adding the appropriate concentrations of salt ions could induce its structure more compact. However, once the threshold concentration is exceeded, it would limit the stability of the mixed gel network.

J		Zhenzhu Zhu; Lipin Yang; Zhong Li; Qin Liu							Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin, and oxidation products of cyanidin protect neuronal function through alleviating inflammation and oxidative damage.		Journal of Food Science					Neurotoxicity seriously affects the normal function of the nervous system. Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) is the most abundant anthocyanin widely distributed in plants. Using beta-amyloid (A beta) transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans and cell models, the neuroprotective effect of C3G was examined. The results showed that C3G remarkably suppressed A beta aggregation, enhanced antioxidant capacity, improved the sensitive capacity towards chemical compounds, and boosted the memory ability of C. elegans. There was no significant difference between preventive and long-term treatment groups at the same dosage of C3G. Given the rapid metabolism and oxidation of C3G in vivo, the antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities of C3G, the metabolite cyanidin (Cy), oxidation products of Cy (OP), as well as protocatechuic acid (PCA) at the corresponding level in OP were compared by using lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV2microglia cell model. The results indicated that C3G, Cy, and OP could prevent BV2 cells against LPS-induced inflammation and oxidative damage. There was no significant difference on antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities among C3G, Cy, and OP at the same level. Notably, PCA at the corresponding concentration in OP exhibited limited antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activities. The results suggested that C3G could exert neuroprotective function through the metabolite Cy and its oxidation products by inhibiting inflammation and oxidative damage, and PCA was not the primary bioactive species in OP. Practical Application. This study confirmed the neuroprotection of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) in transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans. C3G, its metabolite cyanidin (Cy), and oxidation products of Cy (OP) alleviated both neuroinflammation and oxidative damage. It highlighted that C3G-rich foods could exert neuroprotective potential through their oxidation products, the constitution, and existence of OP in vivo need further study. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	5	2159	2172	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16125					FSTA:2022-08-Aj14282

Journal of Food Science					The changes in the volatile profiles of a xylose-cysteine-lecithin reaction model were investigated by using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC*GC-MS) in combination with headspace solid-phase microextraction (SPME) and electronic nose (E-nose) to evaluate the contribution of refrigerating and reheating treatment to warmed-over flavor (WOF). The volatile compound results and E-nose revealed that the contribution of refrigerating and reheating to the WOF was not consistent. After refrigerating, the level of furfuryl mercaptan increased, while that of 1-octene-3-ol, octanal, nonanal, and 2-decanone decreased, which affected the flavors. An increase in the level of 1-octene-3-ol, 2-pentyl-thiophene, and hexanoic acid and a decrease in the levels of furfural, 2-methyl-3-furanthiol, and 2-methyl-3-pentanethiol occurred during reheating. According to the odor activity value and sensory evaluation, the sulfur-like odor became more intense after refrigerating, while the rancid-like odor grew stronger, but the sulfur-like odor alleviated after reheating. Overall, the reaction between residual substances caused the WOF during refrigeration, also lead to the fatty acid oxidation increased after reheating. The overproduction of fatty acids oxidation products and decreased of volatile product of Maillard reaction leads to the WOF during reheating. Practical Application. This study provides theoretical guidance to reduce the off-flavors of meat products. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	3	1069	1081	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16059					FSTA:2022-06-Sa3157
J		Zheyi Song; Lu Cheng; Yanan Liu; Shengnan Zhan; Zufang Wu; Xin Zhang							Plant-derived bioactive components regulate gut microbiota to prevent depression and depressive-related neurodegenerative diseases: focus on neurotransmitters.		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. Depression is a prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder that affects people all around the world. Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD) are two neurodegenerative diseases that are comorbid with depression behaviors. Mounting evidence reveals that gut microbiota is subject to brain activity and function. Therefore, targeting the gut microbiota may be a potential avenue to further the treatment and alleviate symptoms. Scope and approach. Studies in animal models and clinical have determined that the gut microbiota can promote neurotransmitter production and transmission. Disturbance of neurotransmitters has long been thought to play a role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, but particular dietary intake can alter neurotransmitters by modulating the makeup of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites, which speed up the treatment process. Therefore, we outline how neurotransmitters play a part in the major pathways related to the gut-brain axis (GBA). Additionally, the potential pathogenesis of the gut microbiota in AD and PD and the beneficial effects of plant-derived bioactive components are discussed. Key findings and conclusions. In this article, we mainly focus on neurotransmitters derived from the microbiota of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), serotonin (5-HT), and dopamine and their effects on depression and neurodegenerative diseases via GBA. We discuss the dietary intervention of ingesting plant-derived active components such as polyphenols, polysaccharides, and peptides that may provide benefits by regulating the gut microbiota and releasing neurotransmitters/neuroactive metabolites, which provide a better understanding of dietary regulation to play part in anti-depressive and anti-degenerative processes.

J.; Peixin Jiao							Circ007071 inhibits unsaturated fatty acid synthesis by interacting with miR-103-5p to enhance PPARgamma expression in the dairy goat mammary gland.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Understanding more precisely the mechanisms controlling the metabolism of fatty acid in the mammary gland of dairy goats is essential for future improvements in milk quality. Particularly since recent data have underscored a key role for circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the mammary gland function, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to identify expression levels of circRNAs in the mammary tissue of dairy goats during early and peak lactation in the present study. Compared with early lactation, results demonstrated that the expression level of circ007071 during peak lactation was 12.02-fold up-regulated. Subsequent studies in goat mammary epithelial cells (GMECs) revealed that circ007071 stimulated the synthesis of triglycerides (TAG) and cholesterol, as well as increased the content of saturated fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0). More importantly, using a double luciferase reporting system allowed us to detect the circ007071 sequence at a binding site of miR-103-5p, indicating that it targeted this miRNA. Overexpression of circ007071 significantly decreased the abundance of miR-103-5p and led to inhibition of TAG synthesis. In contrast, the abundance of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a target gene of miR-103-5p, was reinforced with the overexpression of circ007071. Thus, we conclude that one key function of circ007071 in the regulation of milk fat synthesis is to attenuate the inhibitory effect of miR-103-5p on PPARgamma via direct interactions with miRNA. As a result, the process of TAG and saturated fatty acid is able to proceed.										2022	70	42	13719	13729	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06174					FSTA:2023-03-Pe1347

Food Chemistry					In this study, a natural antioxidant emulsifier, Millettia speciosa Champ polysaccharide conjugates (MSC-PC), was used for fabricating oil-in-water emulsion, and the influences of MSC-PC on beta-carotene stability and bioaccessibility were studied. Results suggested that MSC-PC stabilized emulsion exhibited excellent resistance to a wide range of salt levels (0-500mM of Na+), thermal treatments (50-90°C) and pH values (3.0-11.0). MSC-PC also exhibited an outstanding inhibition capacity on lipid oxidation. Besides, MSC-PC stabilized emulsion had a better protective effect on beta-carotene than other systems. Interestingly, in spite of similar lipolysis extent, beta-carotene bioaccessibility in MSC-PC fabricated emulsion (14.75 %) was markedly higher than that in commercial Tween 80 fabricated emulsion (10.08 %), likely due to the steric-hindrance effect and antioxidant ability of MSC-PC, building interfacial layers that prevented beta-carotene from degradation. This work supplied a deep insight into elucidating the mechanisms of emulsifying performance and beta-carotene protection effect of MSC-PC fabricated emulsion.

J		Zhi Huang; Min-Hua Zong; Wen-Yong Lou							Effect of acetylation modification on the emulsifying and antioxidant properties of polysaccharide from Millettia speciosa Champ.		Food Hydrocolloids					The highly hydrophilic nature of polysaccharides severely limits their application in oil-in-water emulsion. This work aimed to improve the emulsifying performance of Millettia speciosa Champ polysaccharide (MSCP) by adopting a modification strategy that covalently grafted the acetyl groups to the polysaccharide chains. Three acetylated polysaccharides (AC-MSCP1, AC-MSCP2 and AC-MSCP3) with different degrees of substitution (DS) were successfully prepared and characterized. Acetylation modification led to the degradation of MSCP and decrease in antioxidant ability. Compared with droplet size of MSCP formed emulsion (15.51 mum), a sharp decrease in droplet size of AC-MSCP stabilized emulsion (e.g. 0.24 mum for AC-MSCP2) was observed, which was even smaller than that of gum arabic (GA). Moreover, the emulsifying properties of AC-MSCP was regulated by multi-scale molecular structures. AC-MSCP1, with the lowest DS and molecular weight (MW), formed the largest droplets. AC-MSCP2, with a medium DS and MW, generated the smallest droplets, but droplet size was prone to increase due to low viscosity and electrostatic repulsion. AC-MSCP3, with the highest DS and the largest MW, formed bigger droplets than that of AC-MSCP2, but exhibited better emulsifying stability, owing to strong steric hindrance provided by its highest viscosity and thickest interfacial layer. Altogether, this study confirmed that acetylation modification was a promising method for improving the emulsifying performance of polysaccharide.

Food Control					It was desired to develop the ultrasensitive and efficient strategy for detecting ultratrace aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) and protecting consumers' health. In this study, a magnetic immuno-PCR method (MIPCR) based on the barcode DNA was described and evaluated for detecting AFB1 in agricultural by-product samples. Under the optimal MIPCR, the limit of detection (LOD) was 0.01 pg mL-1, the half inhibitive concentration (IC50) was 1.72 pg mL-1, and the detection range was between 0.01 and 100 pg mL-1. The LOD and IC50 showed 480-fold and 21-fold lower than that of ELISA, respectively. The sensitivity of MIPCR had reached an ultratrace level and considerably improved. The reasonable specificity, precision and accuracy had been demonstrated. Furthermore, the high reliability and applicability of the MIPCR had been further confirmed by the good correlation of LC-MS/MS for the authentic samples. The proposed MIPCR had significantly shortened the analytical procedure, testing time and workload through the powerful probes and magnetic separation, which indicated the high-efficiency performance. This study could provide an alternative approach to detect the AFB1 contamination, and a critical reference for the ultrasensitive and efficient detection of other hazardous chemicals.

J		Zhi Li; Shuangyu Xie; Bo Sun; Yu Zhang; Kai Liu; Li Liu							Effect of KCl replacement of NaCl on fermentation kinetics, organic acids and sensory quality of sauerkraut from Northeast China.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Northeast sauerkraut is widely consumed in north China in which organic acids have an important effect on its quality; while, northeast sauerkraut contains much sodium, which plays a key role in the fermentation of sauerkraut, it is not a benefit for health. Also, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different proportions KCl replacement of NaCl on fermentation kinetics, organic acids, and sensory quality of northeast sauerkraut during the fermentation. The proportion of KCl had a significant impact on the fermentation kinetics, especially for kinetic parameters such as titratable acid (TTA) and reducing sugar (RS). The content of malic acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, and succinic acid in different treatments showed significant differences (p<.05). Meanwhile, the number of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were also affected by KCl. According to quality descriptive analysis (QDA), the substitution ratio of KCl was no more than 50% to avoid the unacceptable taste and low overall liking. Practical applications. The substitution ratio of KCl had an impact on the kinetics of sauerkraut fermentation, as well as the constituents of organic acids and sensory parameters of sauerkraut. Our study results will help to deepen the understanding of the influence of the KCl in sauerkraut production which provides some guidance in the production of sodium-reduction fermented vegetables. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16622					FSTA:2023-01-Ge0181

Journal of Functional Foods					Functionalization and bestowing high values upon bioactive tea polysaccharides have been focused recently. For this purpose, the immune activation effect on RAW264.7 macrophages promoted by Lu'an Guapian polysaccharide (LGP-1,2.35*105 Da) was investigated firstly. LGP-1 was obtained and characterized via DEAE 52 ion exchange column, high performance liquid chromatography and atomic force microscope. Immunological assay manifested a remarkable promotion effect on macrophages. LGP-1 could significantly stimulate the phagocytosis of macrophages, promote NO generation and trigger TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1beta release dose-dependently. Fluorescence labeling tests confirmed the production level of reactive oxygen species increased obviously. Western blot results demonstrated that the treated macrophages were able to increase PI3K expression and p65 nuclear translocation, indicated that LGP-1 enhanced macrophage immunity via PI3K/AKT and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. Moreover, TLR4 was involved in the process. These results made clear that LGP-1 could be explored as a bioactive substance applied in functional foods.

Effect of NaCl and CaCl2 concentration on the rheological and structural characteristics of thermally-induced quinoa protein gels.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of ionic strength on the heat-induced gelation of quinoa protein isolates (QPI) at pH 7 was investigated. The gelation behaviour and gel strength were characterised by oscillatory rheology. The microstructural characteristics of QPI solutions and gels were probed by ultra-small angle neutron scattering (USANS), small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS, SANS), and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This suite of techniques provided structural details covering a wide range of length scales from tens of micron to nanometre. It was found that the gelation temperature decreased from 73 °C to 40 °C and the G* (1 Hz) increased from ~67 Pa to ~1285 Pa with increasing concentration of NaCl from 0 to 200 mM. A particle size of ~32 A and ~57 A was identified within the QPI gel containing 0-200 mM NaCl from SAXS and SANS, respectively and whose size decreased upon addition of CaCl2. For all QPI samples, heat treatment promoted protein aggregation on the micron scale, while a larger structural unit (Rg~ 170 nm) was kept intact as revealed by USANS. A similar mass fractal structure (df=2) was observed in the QPI gels containing 0-200 mM NaCl, while CaCl2 addition caused the formation of large protein agglomerates (Rg~2.5-4.0 mum) with a more compact and denser structural organisation (df=2.5) inside the protein blobs. CLSM showed that the QPI gels containing CaCl2 are prone to phase separation. Overall, this finding shows the thermal gelation behaviour of QPI can be modulated by the ion type and concentration, which is similarly observed in other globular protein systems. These results provide useful information for the design and preparation of quinoa gels for food applications.

J		Zhi Yang; Chen Xu; Qingyu Sun; Xuean Xu; Jun Yu; Haiming Yang; Zhiyue Wang							Effects of dietary vitamin E supplementation levels on growth performance, breast muscle meat quality characteristics, and fatty acid composition of geese.		Journal of Food Science					This study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with vitamin E (VE) on the growth performance, breast muscle quality, fatty acid (FA) composition, and muscle fiber characteristics of geese. In the present study, a total of 240 healthy 29-day-old male Jiangnan white geese were randomly divided into six experimental groups, with five replicates in each group and eight geese in each replicate. Group A, the control group, was fed a basal diet; Groups B, C, D, E, and F were fed diets supplemented with 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80mg/kg VE. After feeding for 70 days of age, one gosling from each replicate was randomly selected and slaughtered to assess the breast muscle quality characteristics, lipid oxidation, FA composition, and muscle fiber characteristics. The results showed that dietary VE supplementation did not significantly affect the growth performance, breast muscle quality characteristics, or muscle fiber characteristics of geese (p> 0.05). Dietary supplementation with 20, 40, and 80mg/kg VE significantly decreased the malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the breast muscle compared with the control group (P< 0.05). Dietary supplementation with 40 and 80mg/kg VE significantly increased the retention of alpha-tocopherol in pectoral muscle, decreased polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) oxidation, and increased the proportion of n-3 PUFAs (p< 0.05). In conclusion, dietary supplementation with 5-80mg/kg VE to the basal diet (VE content of the basal diet: 17.53mg/kg) had no significant effect on the growth performance of geese. However, dietary supplementation with 40-80mg VE increased the retention of alpha-tocopherol in breast muscle tissue, reduced the oxidation of PUFAs, and increased the content of n-3 PUFAs. Thus, under these experimental conditions, dietary supplementation with 40-80mg/kg VE is recommended, which is beneficial to human health. Practical Application. Appropriate supplementation of VE could increase meat quality and the beneficial components in breast muscle of geese. It provides a theoretical basis for future production of high-quality goose meat. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	8	3396	3406	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16232					FSTA:2022-12-Sn6432

Food Chemistry					Apoptosis plays a critical role in sea cucumber autolysis. To investigate the ultraviolet (UV)-induced apoptosis, sea cucumbers with and without injection of BAPTA-AM (cytosolic calcium chelator) were exposed to UV (15 W/m2) for 30 min. The results showed that UV irradiation caused several changes in sea cucumber coelomocytes, including calcium imbalance, abnormal morphology of endoplasmic reticulum, upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins CRT, CHOP, and caspases 9 and 3, and downregulation of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. A comparison between the two groups showed that injection of the calcium chelator into sea cucumbers helped maintain coelomocyte intracellular calcium homeostasis and suppressed other abnormal changes caused by ER stress, indicating apoptosis in sea cucumbers is mediated by calcium imbalance and follows the activation of the ER stress pathway. Therefore, this study broadens understanding of the apoptotic mechanism involved in sea cucumber autolysis, which is helpful in developing preservative agents for sea cucumbers.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Soy protein isolate (SPI) is often used in food processing due to the high water holding capacity and high stability. This paper explored the effect of heat treatment (HT) on the nonlinear rheological properties of acid-Induced soy protein isolate gels modified by high-pressure homogenization. The effects of HT on the storage modulus G′, loss modulus G and gel rate of the SPI gel were studied through time sweep, frequency sweep and strain sweep tests. The effects of the Lissajous curve, Chebyshev stress decomposition and Fourier transformation were also investigated. The results illustrated that the HT significantly enhanced the mechanical properties of the SPI gel. The curve area and energy dissipation of the Lissajous curve after HT were significantly reduced. Chebyshev stress decomposition illustrated that HT enhanced the shear thickening behavior of SPI gel. The study also found that HT significantly improved the structure and strain resistance of the SPI gel structure. In short, HT significantly improved the nonlinear rheological properties of the SPI gel.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Urolithin A (UA) is a metabolite produced in the gut following the consumption of ellagic acid (EA) rich foods. EA has shown anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anticancer properties. Because EA is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, urolithins are considered to play a major role in bioactivity. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is the most common chronic bacterial infection all over the world. It is potentially hazardous to humans because of its relationship to various gastrointestinal diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of UA on inflammation by H. pylori. The results indicated that UA attenuated H. pylori-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo. UA also reduced the secretion of H. pylori virulence factors and tissue injuries in mice. Furthermore, UA decreased the relative abundance of Helicobacteraceae in feces of H. pylori-infected mice. In summary, taking UA effectively inhibited the injury caused by H. pylori.										2022	70	38	11981	11993	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03711					FSTA:2023-02-Aj2127

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The 6% concentration of compound phosphate enhanced the water retention and nutritional value of sea bass fillets. The effects of compound phosphate on the water retention and nutritional quality of sea bass fillets were investigated using the fillets and their in vitro simulated digestives. Compared with the control group, the water-holding capacity of the fillets was increased by 7.07%. Additionally, the nutritional quality of fillets treated with compound phosphate improved. Between 30 and 120min of in vitro simulated digestion, the protein digestibility in the digestion of steamed and fried fillets increased by 67.27 and 57.39%, respectively; the protein particle size decreased by 1148.79 and 951.07 nm, respectively. Atomic force microstructures revealed a significant reduction in macromolecular protein aggregation in the digestion of fillets. The results of this study provide a theoretical basis for the development and processing of low-phosphorus sea bass products. Novelty impact statement. Sea bass is not only tender but also has a high nutritional value and is loved by consumers from all over the world. Phosphate can improve the water retention and frost resistance of sea bass fillets, but excessive phosphorus intake can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, finding the appropriate phosphate concentration is particularly important for the development of low-phosphorus sea bass products. The results showed that the 6% concentration of compound phosphate enhanced the water-holding capacity of fillets and led to an effective increase in protein digestibility and free amino acid count, improving the nutritional quality of sea bass fillets. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16511					FSTA:2022-10-Rc4410
J		Zhi-hui Zhu; Zi-fan Ye; Kai Yang; Jun-jie Hua							Online detection of blood-spot eggs based on a novel method of spectral amplitude space conversion.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					To improve the robustness of the online detection system for blood-spot eggs, a linear converter was established based on Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm to transform spectral signals in the amplitude space, so that error introduced from the variation of sample, mechanical device, and other factors can be reduced to a certain degree. First, the transmission spectrum in the 500-599nm bandwidth of each sample was selected. After preprocessed with the moving average filtering, the spectrum was transformed in the space of spectral amplitude using the LM algorithm. Then, the converted spectrum was utilized to establish the backpropagation neural network model. As the result, the classification model using the transformed spectra realized more than 96% accuracy. When the detection system dealt with different batches of samples produced on different dates, the discriminant accuracy using LM converter was significantly higher than that without (p value<.05). Meanwhile, when the detection system ran at different speeds, the model still showed good robustness, and the accuracy was increased to some degree with LM converter. The research indicated the technical superiority of the model built with the proposed spectra converter over the model without and provided a feasible method to detect blood-spot eggs online for commercial usage. Practical Applications. Blood-spot eggs need to be detected and removed before sale or export. During the task of online detection, the variation of sample batch, conveyor speed, and other factors can introduce error to the predicting outcomes of the classification model. Thus, it is essential for the detection system to stay robust and realize high-accuracy identification under variable external factors. To this end, a novel linear converter for transforming spectral signals based on Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm was studied in this paper. The results showed that the proposed converter could increase the classification accuracy and robustness of detection system to a certain degree, thus realizing accurate and fast online detection of blood-spot eggs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13938					FSTA:2022-04-Qa0262

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Flavoalkaloids are a unique class of compounds in tea, most of which have an N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone moiety substituted at the A ring of a catechin skeleton. 1-Ethyl-5-hydroxy-pyrrolidone, a decomposed product of theanine, was supposed to be the key intermediate to form tea flavoalkaloids. However, we have also detected another possible theanine intermediate, 1-ethyl-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid, and speculated if there are related conjugated catechins. Herein, four novel spiro-flavoalkaloids with a spiro-gamma-lactone structural moiety were isolated from Yingde green tea (Camellia sinensis var. assamica) in our continuing exploration of new chemical constituents from tea. The structures of the new compounds, spiro-flavoalkaloids A-D (1-4), were further elucidated by extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy together with the calculated 13C NMR, IR, UV-vis, high-resolution mass, optical rotation, experimental, and calculated circular dichroism spectra. We also provided an alternative pathway to produce these novel spiro-flavoalkaloids. Additionally, their alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities were determined with IC50 values of 3.34 (1), 5.47 (2), 22.50 (3), and 15.38 (4) muM. Docking results revealed that compounds 1 and 2 mainly interacted with residues ASP-215, ARG-442, ASP-352, GLU-411, HIS-280, ARG-315, and ASN-415 of alpha-glucosidase through hydrogen bonds. The fluorescence intensity of alpha-glucosidase could be quenched by compounds 1 and 2 in a static style.										2022	70	1	136	148	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06106					FSTA:2022-05-Hn4375

Characteristics of cold plasma treatment and enzymatic hydrolysis on IgG/IgE-binding ability of beta-lactoglobulin.		Food Bioscience					Characteristics of cold plasma (CP) treatment and enzymatic (papain and alcalase) hydrolysis on IgG/IgE-binding ability beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) were compared, which is analyzed by immunoblot, WB, ELISA, and LC-MS/MS analysis. Results indicated that CP treatment exhibit similar characteristic to enzymatic hydrolysis to cleave the polypeptides chain of beta-LG for reduction of its IgG/IgE binding ability. A similar tendency of decline in IgG/IgE binding capacity of beta-LG after CP treatment was achieved in comparison with alcalase hydrolysis, which was reduced by 57.69% (IgG) and 56% (IgE) (for 4 min CP treatment) and 61.89% (IgG) and 27.54% (IgE) for alcalase hydrolysis (75 min), while no significant difference was detected for papain hydrolysis. Immunoblot and LC-MS/MS analysis confirmed that the antigenicity reduction was ascribed to the breakdown of the IgG/IgE linear epitopes of beta-LG. Further combined with CP treatment (1 min) with alcalase hydrolysis (75 min), the reduction of antigenicity of beta-LG reached 68.46% (IgG) and 59.26% (IgE). This study suggests that CP treatment is a promising alternative to enzymatic hydrolysis for hypoallergenic protein-producing.

J		Zhi-Xuan Huang; Wei-Feng Lin; Yin Zhang; Chuan-He Tang							Freeze-thaw-stable high internal phase emulsions stabilized by soy protein isolate and chitosan complexes at pH 3.0 as promising mayonnaise replacers.		Food Research International					The development of cholesterol-free mayonnaise has attracted increasing interest in the food colloid field, due to the potential health concerns as a result of consumption of cholesterol-rich mayonnaise. One effective strategy in this regard is to substitute or partially substitute egg yolk with other organic emulsifiers and stabilizers, without affecting the quality of the product. In the work, we reported an effective strategy to fabricate high freeze-thaw-stability high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs), using complexes of a heated soy protein isolate (SPI) and chitosan (CS) at pH 3.0 as the emulsifiers and stabilizers. The SPI/CS complexes, formed even at a very low CS-to-SPI ratio, e.g., 1:10, showed a high capacity to stabilize HIPEs with a high freeze-thaw stability. Increasing the CS-to-SPI ratio in the complexes resulted in a progressive strengthening of gel network in the corresponding HIPEs, together with a gradual improvement of emulsification performance. The gel network of the HIPEs stabilized by the SPI/CS complexes was mainly maintained by the inter-droplet noncovalent interactions involving the CS molecules. The presence of CS also progressively increased the percentage of adsorbed proteins at the interface, and decreased the surface coverage of proteins at the interface. The high freeze-thaw stability of such HIPEs might be unrelated to the ice crystal formation during the freezing, and was more likely associated with the strong steric repulsion contributed to the adsorbed CS molecules between different droplets. The results indicated that the complexation of heated SPI and CS could provide an effective strategy to facilely fabricate outstanding freeze-thaw-stability HI PEs as potential mayonnaise replacers.

Food Hydrocolloids					Low-cost Melaleuca alternifolia residue hydrolysate has great potential as a promising substrate for xanthan gum production but further downstream processing in addition to traditional alcohol-precipitation is necessary to obtain purified xanthan gum from this substrate. In this study, the effect of downstream processing on the structure and rheological properties of xanthan gum generated by fermentation of Melaleuca alternifolia residue hydrolysate was evaluated for the first time. Compared with acid-precipitation and alkali-precipitation, dialysis was much more suitable for xanthan gum purification as demonstrated by the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results, and the xanthan gum with relatively high purity could be obtained after alcohol-precipitation and dialysis. Dialysis after alcohol-precipitation showed little influence on the functional groups of xanthan gum but the microstructure of xanthan gum changed greatly in that a filamentous structure was formed after this treatment. The fermentation performance could be evaluated accurately based on the suitable downstream processing. The purified xanthan gum had similar rheological properties (pseudoplasticity and solid-like/gel-like behavior) to the typical xanthan gum according to its flow curves and linear viscoelastic analysis. However, some rheological properties (existence of Newtonian plateau in flow curves, and crossover of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G) in frequency sweep test) of the purified xanthan gum solution were different from that of the typical xanthan gum. Overall, this study can offer some important information for efficient and effective purification of xanthan gum with a good rheological performance from low-cost Melaleuca alternifolia residue hydrolysate.

Food Chemistry					The wide use of high-fat diet (HFD) causes negative effects on flesh quality in farmed fish. l-carnitine, a lipid-lowering additive, enhances mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation. However its roles in alleviating the effects of HFD on flesh quality in fish are unknown. We fed Nile tilapia with medium-fat diet (MFD, 6% dietary lipid), high-fat diet (HFD, 12% dietary lipid) and HFCD supplemented with l-carnitine (HFCD + 400 mg/kg l-carnitine) for 10 weeks. The HFD-fed fish had higher fat deposition, pH value, myofiber density and flesh hardness than those fed on MFD. However, feeding the fish with the HFCD improved lipid catabolism, which increased significantly lactic acid content and myofiber diameter in muscle, thus reduced pH and hardness values. HFCD also reduced endoplasmic reticulum stress and myofiber apoptosis caused by HFD in the fish. Our study suggests that dietary l-carnitine supplementation alleviates the negative effects of HFD on flesh quality of farmed fish.

J		Zhi-Yuan Li; Peng Zhao; Shao-jiang Song; Xiao-Xiao Huang							Chiral resolution of racemic phenylpropanoids with tyrosinase inhibitory activities from the fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida Bge.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Seven pairs of enantiomeric phenylpropanoids (1a/1b-7a/7b), including eight undescribed phenylpropanoids (1a, 2a/2b, 3a, 5a, 6a/6b, and 7b) were found in the fruits of Crataegus pinnatifida Bge. The enantiomers were separated using chiral column and elucidated through various spectroscopic methods and quantum chemical ECD calculations. The tyrosinase inhibitory activity of enantiomers was tested in vitro. Among them, enantiomers 1a/1b displayed moderate tyrosinase inhibitory activities. The interaction patterns were further studied by molecular docking, and the results indicated compounds 1a/1b may bind in the active site near the copper atom and interacted with the hydrophobic areas in the active pocket. Practical applications. Melanins exist widely in organisms and will be produced more against environmental stresses. Without th enzymatic action of tyrosinase, melanin biosynthesis would be blocked. Thus, tyrosinase inhibitors have been developed to modulate melanin formation. In this study, the enantiomeric phenylpropanoid isolated from the fruits of C. pinnatifida Bge displayed moderate tyrosinase inhibitory activities. This work may provide foundations for further research on tyrosinase inhibitor from natural sources. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14304					FSTA:2023-02-Jg2098
J		Zhibin Liu; Fuchen Chen; Jinyuan Sun; Li Ni							Dynamic changes of volatile and phenolic components during the whole manufacturing process of Wuyi Rock tea (Rougui).		Food Chemistry					Wuyi Rock tea (WRT), a top-ranking oolong tea, possesses characteristic woody, floral, nutty flavor. WRT flavor is mainly formed during the manufacturing process. However, details regarding its formation process are not fully understood yet. In this study, the dynamics of volatile and phenolic components over the whole manufacturing process of WRT were investigated. During withering, despite minor changes in volatile and phenolic components, the central vacuole shrunk remarkably, which reduced the cell mechanical performance and facilitated the subsequent enzymatic fermentation. During fermentation, approximately 78% of flavan-3-ols in fresh tea leaves were oxidized and converted to a diverse mixture of highly heterogeneous oxidation products, such as theaflavins, whereas flavonols, phenolic acids, and xanthine alkaloids remained stable throughout the manufacturing process. Aldehydes, ketones, and heterocyclic compounds, imparting woody, floral, and nutty scent, were mainly formed during the roasting steps. This detailed information can expand our understanding on the formation of WRT flavor.

J		Zhibin Liu; Qin Chen; Chen Zhang; Li Ni							Comparative study of the anti-obesity and gut microbiota modulation effects of green tea phenolics and their oxidation products in high-fat-induced obese mice.		Food Chemistry					Green and black teas are regarded to possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity, however it is not clear which tea performs better in body weight control. In this study, aiming to eliminate cultivar variation, green tea phenolics (GTP) were oxidized by tyrosinase to obtain oxidized tea phenolics (OTP). Thereafter, their anti-obesity effect on high-fat diet induced obese mice were compared. The results showed that despite their distinctive phenolic profiles, GTP and OTP exerted similar anti-obesity properties after 12 weeks of dietary intervention. Furthermore, cecal microbiota profiling exhibited comparable modulatory effects of GTP and OTP on multiple bacterial taxa, including Parabacteroides distasonis, Bifidobacterium, Prevotella, and Akkermansia muciniphila, which were strongly associated with obesity related indexes. Putative bacterial function profiling implicated that both GTP and OTP might regulate the lipid metabolism similarly. Collectively, the oxidation of GTP did not influence the anti-obesity and gut microbiota modulatory effects to any large extent.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					To investigate the exposure of infants to phenylpyrazole and diamide insecticides during lactation, we collected 3467 breast milk samples of lactating women from 100 cities of 24 provinces in China and prepared 100 pooled samples together city-by-city. Among phenylpyrazole insecticides, fipronil and its metabolites (63-100%) were widely detected in breast milk, with total detection concentrations ranging from 178 to 2947 ng/L (median: 921 ng/L). Among diamide insecticides, chlorantraniliprole and flubendiamide were detected in breast milk, but their detection frequencies (20-85%) and concentration levels (nondetected to 89.9 ng/L) were far lower than those of total fipronils. The average estimated daily intake of infants exposed to total fipronils through breast milk is 209 ng/kg-bw/day by upper-bound scenario evaluation, which is higher than the acceptable daily intake (200 ng/kg-bw/day). This study indicates that infants have far higher exposure levels to fipronil than adults, while exposure levels to other types of phenylpyrazoles and diamide insecticides are low.										2022	70	14	4467	4474	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00824					FSTA:2022-08-Pa3607
J		Zhibing Li; Shanggui Deng; Jing Chen							Surface modification via dielectric barrier discharge atmospheric cold plasma (DBD-ACP): improved functional properties of soy protein film.		Foods					Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP), a novel technology, has been widely adopted as an efficient approach in surface modification of the film. The effect of ACP treatment on the physicochemical and structural properties of soy protein film were investigated. As a result, the optimal conditions for the preparation of the film were determined for soy protein (10%), glycerol (2.8%), ACP treatment at 30 kV for 3min, on the basis of elongation at the break, and water vapor permeability. Under the optimal conditions, the ACP-treated films exhibited enhanced polarity according to the increased values of solubility, swelling index, and moisture content, compared with the untreated counterpart. An increase in the hydrophilicity is also confirmed by the water contact angle analysis, which decreased from 87.9° to 77.2° after ACP pretreatment. Thermostability was also improved by ACP exposure in terms of DSC analysis. SEM images confirmed the tiny pores and cracks on the surface of film could be lessened by ACP pretreatment. Variations in the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that some hydrophilic groups were formed by ACP pretreatment. Atomic force microscopy data revealed that the roughness of soy protein film which was pretreated by ACP was lower than that of the control group, with an Rmax value of 88.4 nm and 162.7 nm for the ACP-treated and untreated samples, respectively. The soy protein film was characterized structurally by FT-IR and DSC, and morphological characterization was done by SEM and AFM. The soy protein film modified by ACP was more stable than the control group. Hence, the great potential in improving the properties of the film enables ACP treatment to be a feasible and promising alternative to other modification methods. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of edible oil on the volatile aroma profile and storage quality of garlic paste, and to explore the underlying mechanisms. The administration of blend oil at 40 °C in a garlic to oil ratio of 1.8 had a higher overall acceptance by affective sensory test. Compared with the original garlic paste, the sensory aroma profile of the oil-immersed garlic paste was characterized by suppressed pungency, garlic scent and garlic odor, and enhanced oil scent. SPME-GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS showed that the application of blend oil caused great changes in the level of some compounds, which could explain its role in the oil-immersed garlic paste. Furthermore, the blend oil also reduced the growth rate of the total number of colonies and browning intensity, and inhibited the loss of allicin. Therefore, the application of blend oil in garlic paste improved the sensory aroma and delayed the deterioration of the product quality.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Oat containing rich beta-glucan, polyphenols, flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, and other substances shows good biological activities. Therefore, the present study aimed to uncover the possible mechanism and therapeutic effect of Avenanthramide C in lessening inflammatory responses in pediatric pneumonia. Pediatric pneumonia was induced by liposaccharide (LPS) for vivo model and vitro model. Macrophage was performed to determine the mechanism and effects of Avenanthramide C in pediatric pneumonia. NLRP3 activity participated in the effects of Avenanthramide C in pediatric pneumonia. Avenanthramide C induced p-PI3K and p-Akt expressions and reduced ubiquitination of PI3K expression in pediatric pneumonia. On the other hand, Avenanthramide C integrated serine at 821 sites of the PI3K protein function. Avenanthramide C reduced ROS (reactive oxygen species)-induced mitochondrial damage by PI3K/AKT function in a model of pediatric pneumonia. Avenanthramide C protects pyroptosis in a model of pediatric pneumonia by PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/ROS signaling. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Avenanthramide C protects pyroptosis through dependent ROS-induced mitochondrial damage by PI3K ubiquitination and phosphorylation in a model of pediatric pneumonia, suggesting its potential use for the treatment of pediatric pneumonia and other inflammatory diseases.										2022	70	7	2339	2353	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06223					FSTA:2022-06-Mg3506

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Blueberry (Vaccinium spp.) is a berry with high nutritional and economic value, but it can easily be infected by Botrytis cinerea during postharvest storage. Our previous research has demonstrated that methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment can restrain the development of gray mold decay in blueberries. However, the crucial metabolic-product response to MeJA treatment has not yet been elucidated definitely. In this study, metabolomics was used to study the effect of MeJA on the metabolism level of blueberry fruit infected by B. cinerea. A total of 782 differential metabolites were screened, and results of principal component analysis showed that MeJA treatment induced obvious changes in the metabolic profile of blueberry fruit. MeJA treatment activated the phenylpropane metabolic pathway and promoted the accumulation of rutin, quercetin, ferulic acid, protocatechuic acid, gallic acid, sinapic acid, and hyperin in blueberry fruits. MeJA also enhanced the metabolism of unsaturated fatty acids and induced the synthesis of aspartate, phenylalanine, oleic acid, linolenic acid, and gamma-linolenic acid. This enhancement may be related to MeJA inducing the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle in blueberry fruit to provide sufficient energy and carbon skeleton. Overall, this study highlighted the differential metabolites after MeJA treatment during blueberry infection by B. cinerea and provided a basis for the formulation of new control strategies.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Irradiation of green vegetables with different wavelengths of light represents a safe and effective technology that can be used to maintain postharvest quality. In this regard, our previous research demonstrated that red LED irradiation (50mumol m-2 s-1) helped to delay the senescence of broccoli stored at room temperature. In the present study, a total of 20, 246 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEGs), 3450 differentially expressed lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), and 135 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) were identified in the response of broccoli to LED irradiation during storage, relative to non-irradiated broccoli. Results of the analysis of the DEG products indicated that the effect of red LED light on delaying senescence in broccoli stored at 20°C involves an enhancement of genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis and the synthesis of chlorophyl a from glutamate. Red LED irradiation also delays increases in the expression of photosynthesis-and oxidative phosphorylation-related genes during the senescence of broccoli. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms associated with the response of broccoli to red LED irradiation, and confirms the potential of LED preservation technology.

Food Research International					In this study, the film assembled by caffeic acid-grafted-chitosan/polylactic acid (CA-g-CS/PLA) was used for packaging postharvest Agaricus bisporus, and its effects on postharvest quality of Agaricus bisporus by regulating membrane lipid metabolism were investigated. The results showed that compared to traditional polyethylene packaging, the cell morphology of Agaricus bisporus packaged by CA-g-CS/PLA demonstrated a more complete structure due to its lower permeability, higher fluidity and stronger ability to maintain free water. Meanwhile, CA-g-CS/PLA packaging could effectively delay the decrease rate of unsaturation value and phospholipids of Agaricus bisporus during storage. In addition, the activities and expression levels of lipoxygenase (LOX), phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD) in Agaricus bisporus packaged with CA-g-CS/PLA were inhibited, while those of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) were promoted. Therefore, CA-g-CS/PLA packaging could enhance the postharvest quality of Agaricus bisporus by regulating membrane lipid metabolism, which has great application potential in the field of new intelligent packaging.

Journal of Functional Foods					Corn peptides (CPs) are a novel food obtained from the enzymatic hydrolysis of corn gluten meal. Recent studies indicate the hepatoprotective ability of CPs. However, little is known about the effect of CPs on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of CPs in NAFLD and to decipher the underlying mechanisms. We show that CPs contain large number of antioxidant peptides. They significantly ameliorated oxidative and endoplasmic reticulum stress, and downregulated lipid metabolism-related proteins in in vivo and in vitro models. The AMPKalpha/Sirt1 pathway was activated by CPs, as was evident through the incubation of cells with the AMPK inhibitor, Compound C. These results demonstrate that CPs could be a promising functional food for preventing NAFLD progression, at least in part through activation of the AMPKalpha/Sirt1 pathway.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The impact of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) treatment on oxidative stress, cold damage, and antioxidant enzymes and the role of the UV-B photoreceptor SlUVR8 in tomatoes during cold storage were investigated. Mature-green tomato fruit were irradiated with 1,10, or 100mumolm-2 s-1 UV-B for 1,3, or 6h respectively before cold-storage. The chilling injury index (CI), H2O2, O2-, ion leakage, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in tomatoes stored at 2 °C increased during storage, while irradiation with 10mumolm-2 s-1 UV-B for 3h before storage significantly reduced H2O2 and O2-, membrane damage and chilling injury. Expression of CuZuSOD, FeSOD and CAT1 and the activities of their encoded enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were markedly raised in UV-B-pre-irradiated tomatoes and correlated significantly with the reductions in H2O2, O2-, ion leakage, MDA, and CI, which suggested that UV-B pre-irradiation might exert its effects by activating the antioxidant enzymes. Silencing SlUVR8 dramatically counteracted the UV-B-mediated effects on enzyme expression while the contents of H2O2, O2-, ion leakage, MDA, together with the CI in SlUVR8-silenced tomatoes were significantly higher. The data showed that silencing of SlUVR8 not only suppressed UV-B-activated SOD and CAT expression, but also prevented UV-B-alleviated oxidative stress and chilling injury. The findings indicated that SlUVR8 was required for UV-B-induced cold tolerance in tomato fruit and demonstrated that UV-B irradiation before cold storage activated SOD and CAT in an SlUVR8-dependent manner.

Foods					As a popular food, Chinese yam (CY) powder is widely used for healthy and commercial purposes. Detecting adulteration of CY powder has become essential. In this work, chemometric methods combined with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) were developed for identification and quantification of CY powder adulteration. Pure powders (CY, rhizome of winged yam (RY) and cassava (CS)) and adulterated powders (CY adulterated with CS) were pressed into pellets to obtain LIBS spectra for identification and quantification experiments, respectively. After variable number optimization by principal component analysis and random forest (RF), the best model random forest-support vector machine (RF-SVM) decreased 48.57% of the input variables and improved the accuracy to 100% in identification. Following the better feature extraction method RF, the Gaussian process regression (GPR) method performed the best in the prediction of the adulteration rate, with a correlation coefficient of prediction (Rp2) of 0.9570 and a root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 7.6243%. Besides, the variable importance of metal elements analyzed by RF revealed that Na and K were significant due to the high metabolic activity and maximum metal content of CY powder, respectively. These results demonstrated that chemometric methods combined with LIBS can identify and quantify CY powder adulteration accurately. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) is abundant in dietary fiber, alfalfa saponins, and other active ingredients. However, the application of alfalfa is scarce in food. Meatball is one of the most popular meat products in daily life, but eating too many meatballs could result in obesity, hyperlipidemia, and other diseases. With increasing attention to healthy diet, how to keep the original color, aroma, taste, and shape of food with low fat and nutrition has become an urgent problem to be solved. In this study, different amounts of alfalfa meal or extruded alfalfa meal were added to pork meatballs to explore the optimal adding ratio of two kinds of alfalfa meal in pork meatballs. Further animal experiments were conducted for two weeks to prove the efficacy of two kinds of alfalfa balls in lowering blood lipid and body weight. The results showed that 0.5% alfalfa meal and 1% extruded alfalfa meal could improve the quality of prepared pork meatballs. Animal experiments demonstrated that two kinds of alfalfa meal pork meatballs had a good effect of reducing blood lipid, and the alfalfa meal pork meatballs had a better effect on reducing serum cholesterol and average daily weight gain of mice. This study provided a theoretical basis for making healthy and nutritious pork meatballs, which could provide more delicious food for people, especially people who are obese and the elderly. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Chemistry					In this study, the degradation of myoglobin both in solution and in tuna muscle by cold plasma (CP) was investigated through ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, and the effect of the degradation products on lipid oxidation in washed turbot muscle (WTM) was explored. Result showed that heme in myoglobin was degraded upon CP treatment, from which a fluorescent product was formed and iron was released. The degradation products promoted lipid oxidation in WTM during cold storage, in which the released iron played an important role. Results of gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry analysis showed that the contents of 37 volatile compounds in WTM were increased by heme degradation products induced lipid oxidation, including 20 aldehydes, 9 alcohols, 5 ketones and 3 furans. This study provides a new insight to the mechanism of lipid oxidation in CP-treated fish during cold storage, as well as guidance for preserving myoglobin-containing foods with CP.

Food Chemistry					In this study, the main reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) in cold plasma treated air (CPTA) were determined, and their effects on lipid oxidation, fatty acid composition and volatile profile in dry-cured black carp were investigated. Results showed that ozone (O3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were the main ROS/RNS, both of which were in a few mg/m3 to tens mg/m3. Increased peroxide value (POV), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) level indicated CPTA promoted lipid oxidation in samples. The contents of unsaturated fatty acids (UFA) especially polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in samples after CPTA exposure were decreased significantly. Volatile analysis by headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) showed that CPTA exposure promoted the formation of characteristic volatile flavor compounds in dry-cured black carp via facilitating the oxidation of UFA.

Food & Function					Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is caused by blood flow recovery after an ischemic stroke, and effective treatments targeting I/R injury are still insufficient. Oxidative stress is known to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of cerebral I/R injury. Previous studies have revealed that diosmetin could protect against oxidative stress in cerebral I/R injury, but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects and mechanisms of action of diosmetin on cerebral I/R injury. In vivo, rats were orally gavaged with diosmetin for seven days, and middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established to simulate cerebral I/R injury. The neurological deficit score, cerebral infarct volume, and cortical pathological lesions were measured. In vitro, PC12 cells were exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). To clarify the mechanism, the SIRT1 inhibitor EX527 and the small interfering RNA (siRNA) of SIRT1 were used to downregulate the SIRT1 protein level, respectively. The contents of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione (GSH), and malondialdehyde (MDA) were determined with commercial kits. The protein expressions of SIRT1, total Nrf2 (T-Nrf2), nucleus Nrf2 (N-Nrf2), NQO1 and HO-1 were measured by western blotting. The results showed that diosmetin pretreatment improved neurological outcomes, decreased the cerebral infarct volume and pathological lesions, and inhibited oxidative stress in cerebral I/R rats. In PC12 cells, diosmetin increased cell viability, reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, and inhibited oxidative stress. Besides, diosmetin increased the protein expressions of SIRT1, T-Nrf2, N-Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 both in vivo and in vitro. However, administration of EX527 or silencing the SIRT1 gene with its siRNA eliminated the beneficial effects of diosmetin. Meanwhile, inhibition of SIRT1 decreased the levels of Nrf2 and the protein expressions of its downstream antioxidants NQO1 and HO-1. In conclusion, our data suggested that diosmetin could attenuate cerebral I/R injury by inhibiting oxidative stress via the SIRT1/Nrf2 signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	1	198	212	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02579a					FSTA:2022-04-Aj6228

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					For enriching nutrition of meat analogs, rice bran (RB) was added into meat analogs and the effects of extrusion parameters (moisture content, temperature and screw speed) on the apparent properties and structural characteristics of RB meat analogs were studied. The results showed that with increasing moisture content, the beta2 structure of RB meat analogs was transformed into beta-turn, resulting in a decrease in hardness and tensile force. With increasing temperature (<170°C), the intermolecular hydrogen bond was enhanced, which leaded to the increase of hardness and tensile force. With increasing screw speed, the tensile force increased first and then decreased and reached the maximum at 280 r/min, which caused by the enhancement of intermolecular hydrogen bond. By adjusting extrusion parameters, L* was increased by the decrease of random coils, while tensile force was increased by the enhancement of intermolecular hydrogen bond.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, the effects of photodynamic treatment on the shelf life and purine content of Litopenaeus vannamei under low-temperature storage conditions were investigated. Indicators of shelf life were detected to evaluate the shelf life, and the change of purine content during storage detected by HPLC. The results showed that compared with cold storage, the shelf life of shrimp was extended from 3 days to 8 days with the treatment of microcrystalline storage. Moreover, the shelf life of shrimp was extended to 12 days when stored with the photodynamic treatment combined with microcrystalline storage (PDT + MT). The content of hypoxanthine decreased significantly after 24 h storage, which may be related to the inhibition of 5′-NT, PNP, ADA, and XOD activities. This study provided scientific support for the popularization and application of photodynamic technology in the storage of shrimp. Novelty impact statement.

Food & Function					Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory lung disease that is caused by bacterial infection. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a prototype pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) from Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli), is an essential risk factor for ALI. LPS and E. coli induced the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) signaling pathways, which led to the increasing immune molecule transcription, including pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion. Codonopsis pilosula polysaccharides (CPPS) exhibit various biological activities and pharmacological effects. However, the effect of CPPS on ALI caused by LPS stimulation or E. coli infection remains unclear. Our results showed that CPPS (6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50mug mL-1) could attenuate the secretion of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta and impair the phosphorylation of ERK, p38 and p65 in E. coli-infected macrophages without causing toxic reactions. In addition to regulating the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the activation of MAPK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways, CPPS could enhance bacterial phagocytosis and intracellular killing in macrophages, and inhibit the bacterial growth of E. coli. In vivo experiments showed that CPPS attenuated LPS-and E. coli-induced lung damage in mice, which was characterized by decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-6) and chemokine (RANTES) production and production of the biomarkers of tissue damage (HABP2 and HMGB1) in the lungs. Altogether, this study demonstrated that CPPS have a protective effect on the lungs in LPS-and E. coli-induced ALI mouse models, suggesting that CPPS could be a potential drug for the treatment of ALI. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	15	7999	8011	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01221a					FSTA:2023-01-Te0146
J		Zhiguo Jiang; Jiaolong Wang; Dong Xiang; Zhengke Zhang							Functional properties and preservative effect of p-hydroxybenzoic acid grafted chitosan films on fresh-cut jackfruit.		Foods					In the present study, p-hydroxybenzoic acid-grafted chitosan (PA-g-CS) conjugates with different grafting degrees were synthesized by a free radical-regulated grafting approach. The conjugates were further developed into films by casting, and their characteristics and preservative effects on fresh-cut jackfruit were evaluated. Compared to the CS film, the PA-g-CS film showed comprehensive performance improvements, including enhancements of water solubility, anti-ultraviolet capacity, antioxidation, and antibacterial activity. Moreover, compared with CS film, some appreciable and favorable changes of physical properties were observed in the PA-g-CS films, which included water vapor permeability, oxygen permeability, surface morphology, moisture content, and mechanical intensity. Furthermore, compared to CS alone, the application of PA-g-CS films to fresh-cut jackfruit exerted a beneficial effect on the quality of products, as indicated by the inhibition of weight loss, softening, and membrane damage, the maintenance of soluble solids and ascorbic acids contents, as well as a reduced bacterial count and a higher sensory score. Among these PA-g-CS films, the best preservation effect was achieved with the highest degree of grafting (PA-g-CS III). The results suggested that the PA-g-CS film has the potential to be explored as a new type of packaging material for the preservation of fresh-cut fruits and vegetables. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of Functional Foods					In the present study, polysaccharides with antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities were isolated from the crude extract of pepper leaves by high-speed countercurrent chromatography in one step for the first time. An aqueous polymer two-phase system comprising PEG1000-K2HPO4-KH2PO4-H2O (0.8:1.25:1.25:6.5, w/w) was used for separation. During each separation, 2.0 g of the crude sample yielded two homogeneous components of polysaccharides PLP1 (226 mg) and PLP2 (273 mg). The molecular weights of PLP1 and PLP2 were 123 kDa and 243 kDa, respectively. PLP1 primarily consisted of mannose and glucose at a molar ratio of 1:2.4, whereas PLP2 was mainly composed of galactose, glucose, and rhamnose at a molar ratio of 2.6:1:2.2 with 10.3% (w/w) sulphates. Biological activity showed that sulfated PLP2 exhibited stronger antioxidant activity in vitro and hypoglycemic activity in diabetic mice than PLP1. The results demonstrated that sulfated PLP2 possessed potential as natural hypoglycemic agents or antioxidants in food or pharmaceuticals.

J		Zhiguo Zhang; Hui Li; Shishan Zhang; Huijuan Li; Xiangfeng Chen							Initial dietary risk assessment of chlorinated paraffins in edible fungi in Chinese markets.		Journal of Food Science					Dietary intake is one of the main pathways for residents to become exposed to chlorinated paraffins (CPs). In China, due to the popularization of nutritional and medicinal edible fungi, consumption has increased on a yearly basis. Edible fungi have a variety of active substances and are consumed daily by residents. However, there is limited information on the concentration and source of chlorinated paraffins in edible fungi. In this study, the concentrations of short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) in 105 edible fungi samples and 36 culture material samples were detected. The concentration range of SCCPs was 79.8 ng/g dw to 3879.3 ng/g dw, and the MCCPs was ND to 572.3 ng/g dw. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that the sources of SCCPs and MCCPs in edible fungi were similar (r = 0.57, p< 0.01). The preponderant SCCPs and MCCPs congener group profiles were C10Cl7-8 and C14Cl6-8. CPs were detected in culture materials, the concentration range of SCCPs was 320.2 ng/g dw to 4326 ng/g dw, and the MCCPs was 333.4 ng/g dw to 4517.4 ng/g dw. And the preponderant SCCPs and MCCPs homologues in culture materials were C11-12Cl6 and C14Cl6. The linear discriminant analysis results indicated different contamination models of CPs between edible fungi and culture materials. The mean estimated daily intake values of SCCPs and MCCPs were 308.1 ng/kg bw/d and 94.4 ng/kg bw/d, respectively, indicating no potential health risk posed by CP exposure in edible fungi. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	10	4761	4770	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16319					FSTA:2023-02-Jq2831

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. To investigate the contributions of chemical and microbial diurnal variations in fermentation characteristics and bacterial community of Napier grass silage, gamma-ray irradiated Napier grass harvested at 07.00h (AM), 12.00h (M) and 17.00h (PM) was inoculated with the microbiota derived from Napier grass harvested at AM, M and PM in a 3 (irradiated forage: AMG, MG and PMG) * 3 (microbiota: AMM, MM and PMM) design and then ensiled for 14 and 60days. Results. Napier grass harvested at various times had different chemical compositions and epiphytic microbiota prior to ensiling. For silages inoculated with the same microbiota, the pH values, residual water soluble carbohydrates and dry matter contents increased, and lactic acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid, ethanol and volatile fatty acids contents decreased in PMG and MG silages compared to AMG silages. MM and PMM inoculum promoted lactic acid fermentation as indicated by higher lactic acid contents and lactic/acetic acid ratios in MM and PMM-inculated silages compared to those in AMM-inoculated silages after 60 days of ensiling. During ensiling, epiphytic microbiota affected the Chao1 index, operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number and Shannon index, as well as the abundances, of more than half of the top 10 abundant genera, whereas chemical composition did not affect any of the bacterial diversity and richness indices and only showed significant impacts on the abundances of two genera. Conclusion. The results indicated that chemical diurnal variation exerted an influence mainly on the extent of fermentation, whereas microbial diurnal variation affected more the bacterial community and fermentation types during Napier grass ensiling. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	10	4322	4332	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11784					FSTA:2022-10-Bk1743

Foods					By separating and extracting algae from the collected water samples, an oil-producing diatom strain was obtained. Microscopic observation of the strain revealed that its morphological characteristics were highly similar to those of the genus Cyclotella. The cloning of 18S rDNA and phylogenetic analysis showed that the algae were clustered with Cyclotella menegheniana with a high support rate, indicating that the alga was C. menegheniana. The fatty acid content of the alga was determined and found to be mainly C14, C16, and C18 fatty acids, which were in accordance with the relevant standards for edible oil. In this study, different gradient levels of salinity and light were set to investigate the culture and bioactive substance production of C. menegheniana. The results showed that the best growth condition was achieved when the salinity was 15g.L-1, and its biomass and oil content were the highest at 0.27g.L-1 and 21%, respectively. The final biomass was the highest when the light intensity was 2000 Lux and the oil content was 18.7%. The results of the study provided a basis for the large-scale production of edible oils and biodiesel. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Science and Biotechnology					In this study, a high monacolin K yield was achieved through solid-state fermentation of Ginkgo biloba seeds. Monascus purpureus suspension made from red yeast rice was used as spore inoculum. Fermentation conditions in solid-state fermentation were optimized using response surface methodology, and the optimal conditions for the maximum monacolin K yield (17.71 1.57mg/g) were 0.22% ammonium sulfate, 0.34% ammonium chloride, 0.05% magnesium sulfate, fermentation time of 12 days, inoculation volume of 11%, and temperature of 27°C. The total phenolic content of Monascus-fermented ginkgo seeds attained 9.67mg GAE/g, 4.88-fold higher than that of unfermented ginkgo seeds. The scavenging abilities of DPPH and ABTS free radicals increased to 9.79mg TE/g and 13.92mg TE/g, respectively.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The fresh keeping ability of ultrasound-assisted immersion freezing (UIF), immersion freezing (IF), and refrigerator freezing (RF) was compared in Fenneropenaeus chinensis (F. chinensis). Observation of muscle microstructure indicated that UIF treatment had the smallest ice crystals formation with uniform distribution, resulting in minimal damage to muscle tissues. Meanwhile, UIF-treated F. chinensis showed slower pH change, lower values of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The higher values of salt soluble protein content, Ca2+ -ATPase activity, and water-holding capacity revealed that UIF could inhibit protein degeneration and moisture loss. In addition, an excellent sensory evaluation score also verified the efficient fresh keeping capacity of UIF. Our results indicate the potential of UIF in maintaining the freshness and quality of F. chinensis during frozen storage. Novelty impact statement. Preservation effects of different freezing methods to Fenneropenaeus chinensis were compared. Ultrasound-assisted immersion freezing caused less tissue damage to shrimp and could inhibit the spoilage during frozen storage.

J		Zhihong Lyu; Sala, G.; Scholten, E.							Water distribution in maize starch-pea protein gels as determined by a novel confocal laser scanning microscopy image analysis method and its effect on structural and mechanical properties of composite gels.		Food Hydrocolloids					The objective of this study was to determine the water distribution in maize starch (MS) and pea protein isolate (PPI) composite gels and understand how the separate contributions of MS and PPI affect the mechanical properties of composite gels with varying MS/PPI ratios. A series of MS gels with increasing PPI contents and a series of PPI gels with increasing MS contents were prepared. The water distribution was evaluated with a novel image analysis method using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). This method was used to quantify the volume fraction of each phase, from which the water distribution between the starch phase and the protein phase within the gels was estimated. Depending on the MS/PPI ratios, either a dispersed or a bicontinuous gel was formed. The estimated stiffness of each phase was used to estimate the gel stiffness using models for either dispersed or bicontinuous structures. These predictions were shown to be in good agreement with experimental data obtained from compression tests. The determination of the properties of each phase separately allowed us to determine which phase dominated the properties of the composite gel. In filled gels, the MS network dominated the gel properties, unless the stiffness of PPI fillers was remarkably higher than that of the MS network. In bicontinuous gels, the stiffness of the composite gels was determined by the network with the highest stiffness. Dispersing pea protein aggregates (PPA) with different size into MS gels resulted in minor differences in mechanical properties compared to PPI-MS gel. These results show that this new analysis method can be used to predict water distribution within gels, and how this leads to changes in the stiffness, hardness and brittleness of the gels.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Based on the determination of the chemical composition of essential oils by GC-MS, the antibacterial activities and mechanism of combined essential oils extracted from Origanum vulgare L. and Houttuynia cordata T. (denoted as C-EO hereafter) were investigated. The possibility of using C-EO as a potential substitute for synthetic antiseptics was studied for the first time. C-EO exhibited significant antibacterial and anti-biofilm activities against Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Paratyphi beta. The FICI of C-EO against S. Enteritidis and S. Paratyphi beta were all within 0.563, it indicates that C-EO demonstrated additive antibacterial effects. Antibacterial mechanism of C-EO against the two strains was determined by analyzing the completeness of the cell membrane and the counteractant for bacterial biofilm. The finding that C-EO plays a bacteriostatic effect by disrupting cell walls and membranes was verified intuitively via scanning electron microscopy. Results showed that C-EO may potentially play an essential role in food preservation. Novelty impact statement. The antibacterial mechanism of the combined EOs (C-EO, which were extracted from Origanum vulgare L. and Houttuynia cordata T) against Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Paratyphi beta was determined for the first time.

Food & Function					This research investigated the effects of camel whey protein (CWP) treatment on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats and insulin resistance (IR) HepG2 cell models. Body weight and fasting blood glucose were observed in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats every week, and biochemical parameters in serum samples were evaluated after 6 weeks. Antioxidant activity in the liver was estimated, and histological examination of the liver tissues was conducted. After CWP treatment, the glucose uptake and lipid accumulation were examined in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. Our results indicated that CWP mitigated the body weight loss, reversed dyslipidemia, and inhibited the inflammatory response, in T2DM rats. Meanwhile, it protected the liver from being injured by reducing the level of oxidative stress. In the CWP group, the pathological changes were significantly reduced, while the liver lobule structure, liver cell arrangement, as well as congestion, edema, and vacuolization were improved. Our results from quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analyses showed that CWP could up-regulate the expression levels of insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS-2), phosphoinositide3-kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), and glycogen synthase (GS). An active protein component CWP8 was isolated and identified, which was shown to be able to stimulate glycogen synthesis and ameliorate lipid accumulation in IR HepG2 cells. These data indicate that CWP and CWP8 might act as potential natural products regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in T2DM. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	1	255	269	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01174j					FSTA:2022-04-Pa1728

Foods					With a high moisture content, fresh peppers are perishable and rot easily. Drying is essential for shelf-life extension. The natural thin wax layer on the pepper surface hinders moisture transfer. Traditionally, chemical dipping or mechanical pricking is used to remove this wax layer. However, in chemical dipping, chemical residues can trigger food-safety issues, while the low efficiency of mechanical pricking hinders its industrial application. Feasible pretreatment methods are advantageous for industrial use. Here, an emerging pretreatment technique (high-humidity hot-air impingement blanching, HHAIB) was used for peppers before drying and its effects on drying characteristics, microstructure, and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity were explored. The impact of drying temperature on color parameters and red pigment content of pulsed-vacuum-dried peppers was also evaluated. PPO activity was reduced to less than 20% after blanching at 110°C for 60 s. HHAIB reduced drying time and PPO activity and promoted chemical-substance release. Effective water diffusivity was highest (5.01 * 10-10 m2/s) after blanching at 110°C for 90 s, and the brightness value and red pigment content were highest (9.94g/kg) at 70°C. HHAIB and pulsed vacuum drying are promising pretreatment and drying methods for enhancing the drying rate and quality of red peppers. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					As the main drying systems used in different industries, convective dryers are associated with some elementary shortcomings. Combination of the systems and infrared power could result in shorten the process time, uniform heating, efficient energy consumption, and high-quality dried products. In this study, 3mm carrot slices were dried by practicing different air temperatures, infrared powers and irradiation distances. Response surface methodology was also used to optimize the process variables. The average diffusivity varied in the range of 2.01 * 10-10-12.10 * 10-10 m2/s. The consumed specific energy changed from 30.20 to 87.51 MJ/kg. Shrinkage of the carrots was in the range of 23.49-51.25%. The range of rehydration ratio and total color change of the dried carrots was 4.71-9.01 and 15.25-33.17, respectively. The antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were found to be varied from 60.07 to 89.57% and from 26.59 to 42.65mg GA/10g dry matter, respectively. Designating by desirability function of about 0.89, the optimized control factors were determined to be 73.3°C air temperature, 720 W infrared power and 7cm irradiation distance.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Metabolome analysis of high-salt fermented food can be an analytical challenge, as the salts can interfere with the sample processing and analysis. In this work, we describe a four-channel chemical isotope labeling (CIL) LC-MS approach for a comprehensive metabolome analysis of high-salt fermented food. The workflow includes metabolite extraction, chemical labeling of metabolites using dansyl chloride, dansylhydrazine, or p-dimethylaminophenacyl bromide reagents to enhance separation and ionization, LC-UV measurement of the total concentration of dansyl-labeled metabolites in each sample for sample normalization, mixing of 13C-and 12C-reagent-labeled samples, high-resolution LC-MS analysis, and data processing. Metabolome analysis of fermented foods, including fermented red pepper (FRP) sauce, soy sauce, and sufu (a fermented soybean food), showed unprecedented high metabolic coverage. Metabolome comparison of FRP, soy sauce, and sufu, as well as soy sauce and sufu, indicated great diversity of metabolite types and abundances in these foods. In addition, we analyzed two groups of samples of the same type, FRP with 10% (w/w) and 15% (w/w) salt contents, and detected large variations in multiple categories of metabolites belonging to a number of different metabolic pathways. We envisage that this CIL LC-MS approach can be generally used for metabolomic studies of high-salt fermented food. CIL LC-MS allows high-coverage identification and quantification that could not be done using other methods.										2022	70	28	8827	8837	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03481					FSTA:2022-11-Tc4643
J		Zhihua Liu; Yezi Yang; Chongzhi Sun; Yang Wu; Xiaobo Li							Comparative phytochemical property and antioxidant activity of sixteen Mei (Prunus mume) fruit cultivars from six provinces in China.		International Journal of Food Properties					Mei (Prunus mume) is widely planted in Eastern Asian countries. To evaluate the effect of cultivar and producing origin on the quality of Mei fruit, we studied the phytochemical properties and antioxidant activities of the 16 Mei fruit cultivars from 6 provinces in China, as well as their profiles of 121 volatile compounds, 5 organic acids, 13 minerals, 24 amino acids and 3 active peptides. Multivariate analysis revealed that the four Mei fruit cultivars with a drier climate in Yunnan province had the characteristics of low water moistures and proteins contents, high total acids, soluble solids, flavones, and phenols contents, and high antioxidant activities, which could be distinguished from fruits of other producing areas. Further component analysis showed that Mei fruits were rich in volatile compounds, organic acids (such as citric acid and malic acid), minerals (such as K, Ca, Mg, P, and Fe), and amino acids (such as Orn, Asn, and Asp), and the nutrient composition ratio in different cultivars was different. In conclusion, Mei fruits can be used as nutritious health food and different cultivars focus on different nutritional compositions. © 2022 Zhihua Liu, Yezi Yang, Chongzhi Sun, Yang Wu and Xiaobo Li.

J		Zhihua Pang; Yuwan Luo; Peipei Ma; Cunshe Chen; Xinqi Liu							Fundamental understanding of the role of gelatin in stabilizing milk protein systems during acidification.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of two types of gelatin (A & B) on the stability of the dispersions with 1% milk proteins during acidification was studied. A dramatically different effect was observed with gelatin concentration from 0.1% to 1%. Gelatin B showed no significant effect on the zeta potential of the dispersions, while gelatin A changed the zeta potential from negative to positive with an increase in concentration. From the microrheology results, gelatin B showed little effect on elasticity index (EI), except that the samples containing higher concentrations led to slight decrease in EI values due to the steric inference. Conversely, gelatin A showed greater influence on EI, and the effect was more significant at low concentrations than high concentrations. Both static and dynamic light scattering (SLS & DLS) showed that low concentrations of gelatin A induced faster aggregation of milk proteins, while both types of gelatin showed stabilizing effect at high concentrations. CD spectra indicated that the gelatin/casein interaction could be the major attribute for the different effects of two types of gelatin on milk proteins.

Food Science & Nutrition					Due to the physiological characteristics of piglets, the morphological structure and function of the small intestinal mucosa change after weaning, which easily leads to diarrhea in piglets. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of crude protein (CP) levels on small intestinal morphology, occludin protein expression, and intestinal bacteria diversity in weaned piglets. Ninety-six weaned piglets (25 days of age) were randomly divided into four groups and fed diets containing 18%, 20%, 22%, and 24% protein. At 6, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, changes in mucosal morphological structure, occludin mRNA, and protein expression and in the localization of occludin in jejunal and ileal tissues were evaluated. At 6, 24, and 72 h, changes in bacterial diversity and number of the ileal and colonic contents were analyzed. Results showed that structures of the jejunum and the ileum of piglets in the 20% CP group were intact. The expression of occludin mRNA and protein in the small intestine of piglets in the 20% CP group were significantly higher than those in the other groups. As the CP level increased, the number of pathogens, such as Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli, in the intestine increased, while the number of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, and Roseburia, decreased. It is concluded that maintaining the CP level at 20% is beneficial to maintaining the small intestinal mucosal barrier and its absorption function, reducing the occurrence of diarrhea, and facilitating the growth and development of piglets. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					The bacterial diversity of salted mackerel "one-night courtyard" at soft frozen area (-7°C-0°C) storage was studied. The fish samples at 0, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days were analysis for bacterial structure using high-throughput sequencing technologies (HTS) and biogenic amines using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analysis results of HTS showed that the dominant bacteria species was varied gradually following with storage time. On the 0th, 21st, and 28th days of storage, dominant Vibrionaceae was accounting for 71.70%, 59.16%, and 70.68% of the total sequences analyzed, respectively. On the 14th and 35th days, Shewanellaceae was the dominant bacterial, accounting for 87.53% and 70.95% of the total sequences analyzed, respectively. In addition, 21st and 28th days, an abundance of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) was top. The dominant bacterial of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, was producer of biogenic amines. Furthermore, the analysis results of HPLC shown the total biogenic amines of maximum amount 363.01mg/kg in the sample of HY. 14 lower than 1000mg/kg of the FDA regulation. The range ability of cadaverine was obvious following with the storage time. Cadaverine was 87.36mg/kg on the 0th day, and it was maximum amount of 276.89mg/kg on the 14th days. Putrescine was 20mg/kg on the 0th day and maximum amount of 55.04mg/kg on the 28thdays of storage. The tyramine was smallest amount of production, and the largest amount was 38.99mg/kg on 28th, and the smallest amount was 11.97mg/kg on 35th. Nevertheless, the maximum amount of histamine was 55.04mg/kg on the 0th day and about 23.14mg/kg of histamine was little change from 14th to 35th days of storage. Dominant bacteria affect the change of biogenic amines. The study can help understand the interaction between microbial flora and biogenic amines in the salted mackerel of one-night courtyard. © 2022 The Authors.

Food Chemistry					The application of blueberry anthocyanins (ANs) was limited due to their low in-process stability and bioavailability. In our study, the stability and antioxidant capacity of ANs before and after adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) were examined by simulating various processing, storage (light, sucrose, and vitamin C (Vc)), and in vitro simulated digestion parameters. For this purpose, pH-differential method, high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), peroxyl scavenging capacity assay, and cellular antioxidant assay were conducted. BSA at different concentrations, specifically at 0.15 mg/mL, inhibited the degradation of ANs and the loss of antioxidant capacity. The results suggest that BSA has a positive effect on ANs.

J		Zhihui Feng; Ming Li; Yifan Li; Junfeng Yin; Xiaochun Wan; Xiaogen Yang							Characterization of the key aroma compounds in infusions of four white teas by the sensomics approach.		European Food Research and Technology					White teas are produced in the simple process of withering and drying the tender leaves of the plant Camellia sinensis. Tea aroma created in this way exhibits a unique profile. Studies were carried out on the molecular contributors to the aroma character of the four well-known traditional white teas: Baihaoyingzhen (BHYZ), Baimudan (BMD), Gongmei (GM), and Shoumei (SM). Volatiles of the tea infusions were enriched by solvent partitioning followed by solid-phase extraction (SPE). The highly volatile compounds were captured by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS SPME). Gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) experiments discovered 37 odor-active components. Quantitation of aroma compounds was achieved using the method of standard addition (SAM). Calculation of odor activity value (OAV) and aroma reconstitution experiments revealed that the aroma profiles of the four white teas were attributed by 15 compounds, although a total of 179 volatile components were found in the extracts. BHYZ had distinct floral, fruity, and sweet characters, while BMD, GM, and SM had stronger woody and fermented notes. The major aroma contributors to the floral and sweet characters were geraniol and linalool for BHYZ and BMD; 2-phenylethanol and phenylacetaldehyde for GM and SM. The compounds produced from amino acid reactions during tea manufacturing, e.g.dimethyl sulfide, 3-methylbutanal, phenylacetaldehyde, etc., formed the basis of fruity and refreshing attributes. Degradation products of glycosides and carotenoids, such as geraniol, linalool, and ionones, contributed to the essential floral and sweet characters of the white teas. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	5	1299	1309	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-03967-3					FSTA:2022-07-Hn6651
J		Zhihui Qi; Xin Zhou; Lin Tian; Haiyang Zhang; Lei Cai; Fang Tang							Distribution of mycotoxin-producing fungi across major rice production areas of China.		Food Control					Mycotoxin contamination of rice (Oryza sativa), especially that from aflatoxins (AFTs), is one of the greatest chemical hazards to humans and animals. However, few studies have investigated the relationships between fungal communities and mycotoxin contamination of rice grains. In the present study, we collected rice grain samples from 10 provinces in the northeastern (NE), southeastern (SE), and southwestern (SW) regions of China, encompassing the major rice-producing areas of China. The Fungal diversities of rice grains were significantly different among different regions and significantly higher in the SE and SW regions compared to the NE region. Geographic location was highly associated with fungal community alpha and beta diversity differences. Environmental variables determined the distribution of fungal communities, with winter mean temperature (WMT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), harvest mean wind speed (HMW), and grain moisture (GM) being the most important factor shaping the fungal communities, and the higher HMW could significantly reduce the abundance of aflatoxigenic fungi and aflatoxins. The Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus were defined as the major AFT-producing fungal taxa observed in the SE and SW region communities. The NE region exhibited a lower risk of AFT contamination due to its much lower prevalence of toxigenic fungi. Furthermore, keystone taxa of co-occurrence network analyses indicated that species belonging to the genera Clonostachys, Cryptococcus, Hannaella, Leptosphaerulina, Leptosphaeria, Phaeosphaeria, Sarocladium, Sphaerulina, Wallemia and Ustilaginoidea exhibited abundances that were negatively correlated with AFT-producing fungal abundances and could potentially inhibit the growth of AFT-producing fungi. The results provide potentially important data for the strategic guidance of local rice grains storage in order to better control toxin contamination and improve grain quality.

J		Zhihui Qi; Xin Zhou; Lin Tian; Haiyang Zhang; Lei Cai; Fang Tang							Temporal and spatial variation of microbial communities in stored rice grains from two major depots in China.		Food Research International					Microbial activity in stored rice grains could cause quality deterioration and mycotoxin accumulation that may lead to serious economic losses and food safety risks. However, limited studies have examined the spatial and temporal variation of microbial communities associated with stored rice grains. Here, we performed amplicon sequence analysis to investigate the temporal and spatial distribution of microbes in stored rice grains from Chongqing grain depot (Southern China) and Liaoning grain depot (Northern China). Bacterial and fungal diversities, in addition to community structures of rice grains in Chongqing were significantly different from those in Liaoning in terms of alpha diversity (Chongqing > Liaoning, p<001) and beta diversity (p< 0.001, bacterial communities: R = 0.9293, fungal communities: R = 1.0). The core bacterial taxa among stored rice grains comprised Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, and Methylobacterium, while the core fungal taxa comprised Alternaria, Aspergillus, and Cladosporium. In addition, different microbial communities were observed at different stored time points (i.e., post-harvest period, storage for one year, and storage for two years), and along different stored vertical depths (upper, middle, and lower layers) within the Chinese horizontal warehouse. The relative abundances of Aspergillus increased over storage time, but decreased with the increase of stored vertical depth within the warehouse. Temperature was the most important factor associated with differences in microbial communities across storage periods. The potential mycotoxin producing fungal species A. flavus and A. niger exhibited significantly higher abundances in rice grains of Chongqing compared to those of Liaoning. These data could be useful for evaluating potential risks of toxigenic fungi and mycotoxin contamination of stored rice grains. Further, these insights can help grain depot managers optimize storage conditions and reduce risks of deleterious fungi during rice grains storage.

J		Zhihui Wang; Shuang Gan; Weijiang Sun; Zhidan Chen							Widely targeted metabolomics analysis reveals the differences of nonvolatile compounds in oolong tea in different production areas.		Foods					The flavor differences in Oolong tea from different producing areas are caused by its complex differential compounds. In this study, representative samples of Oolong tea from four countries were collected, and their differential nonvolatile compounds were analyzed by a combination of widely targeted metabolomics, chemometrics, and quantitative taste evaluation. A total of 801 nonvolatile compounds were detected, which could be divided into 16 categories. We found that the difference in these compounds' content among Oolong teas from three producing areas in China was the largest. There were 370 differential compounds related to the producing areas of Oolong tea, which were mainly distributed in 67 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathways. In total, 81 differential nonvolatile compounds made important contributions to the taste differences in Oolong tea from different producing areas, among which the number of flavonoids was the largest. Finally, the characteristic compounds of Oolong tea in six producing areas were screened. This study comprehensively identifies the nonvolatile compounds of Oolong tea in different producing areas for the first time, which provides a basis for the analysis of flavor characteristics, quality directional control, and the identification and protection of geographical landmark agricultural products of Oolong tea from different producing areas. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Mycotoxin B1 (AFB1) contamination in agricultural products pose a deadly danger to animal and human health and its rapid and reliable detection is thus very important. Herein, a ratiometric surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) aptasensor for AFB1 detection was developed, in which 1,2-bis (4-pyridyl) ethylene (BPE) was used to trigger the assembly of Au nanoparticle dimers (AuNP dimers) and form intensive SERS "hot spots", and MXenes nanosheets could load aptamer-modified AuNP dimers due to the hydrogen bonding and the chelation between the phosphate groups of aptamers and the Ti ion of MXenes. With the presence of AFB1 preferentially binding to AFB1 aptamer, AuNP dimers were separated from MXenes nanosheets, leading to a decrease in SERS intensity. Regression analysis in the range from 0.001 to 100 ng.mL-1 showed the limit of detection (LOD) being 0.6 pg.mL-1 in standard solution, indicating that the great prospects of the AuNP dimers/MXenes SERS substrate for detecting AFB1.

J		Zhihui Yu; Jingrong Hu; Shuxiao Gao; Ruifeng Han; Ling Ma; Yisheng Chen							Joint effects of enzymatic and high-intensity ultrasonic on the emulsifying propertiesof egg yolk.		Food Research International					This study investigated the joint effect of the enzymatic and high-intensity ultrasonic (HIU) treatments on the emulsifying and structural properties of egg yolk (EY). The evaluation was performed under different HIU powers (i.e., 0, 240, and 480 W) and for different durations (10, 20, and 30 min). Results reveal that the emulsification activity and emulsification capacity at 240 W for 10 min significantly increase than that of the samples without HIU treatment (P< 0.05). The thermal stability reached a maximum of 90.33% in 480 W + 30 min. The HIU treatment under low power and for a short time (240 W + 10 min) reduced the average particle size of the EY to 224.77 nm. The combined treatment produced high zeta potential and total sulfhydryl contents. The highest hydrophobicity was 111.49 mug at 240 W for 20 min. The joint treatment enhanced the hardness and cohesiveness of the EY. Moreover, the alpha-helix content significantly decreased from 37.13% to 25.02% after the enzymatic treatment, while the beta-sheet content increased with time in the 240 W treatment. The G' and G curves show an increasing tendency, and the highest G' and G were obtained in the 240 W + 30 min group, which is consistent with the dense microstructure. These results reveal that the combined treatment can improve the emulsifying characteristics, which could influence the structural properties of EY, expanding its application in the food industry.

J		Zhihui Yu; Haoran Guo; Chen Liu; Rui Wang; Lixin Zhang; Xiaoyu Zhang; Yisheng Chen							Ultrasound accelerates pickling of reduced-sodium salted duck eggs: an insight into the effect on physicochemical, textural and structural properties.		Food Research International					In this work, high-intensity ultrasound (HIU) was used to accelerate the pickling of the reduced-sodium salted duck eggs (RSSDE). Meanwhile, it was evidenced that HIU treatment was also helpful to improve the overall quality of RSSDE. When the optimized HIU at 80 W was used, it resulted in favorably higher hardness (1.83 N), springiness (4.20mm), and chewiness (4.83mJ) of RSSDE whites, while the lowest hardness (1.12 N) of RSSDE yolks. The average particle size of RSSDE whites was significantly reduced (230.37 nm, 7.14%) as well. Apart from that, the absolute zeta potential and hydrophobicity were increased to-8.63mV by 14.30% and 164.70mug by 3.12%, respectively, attributed to the destruction of protein aggregation by cavitation effects. The oil exudation showed an obvious rising during the 14 days of the salting. HIU treatment at 80 W destroyed the emulsification state of lipid droplets and led to higher oil exudation (39.30%). The structural analysis of RSSDE proteins revealed marked alterations following HIU, with a reduction in alpha-helix and an increase in beta-turn and random coil. The highest r-value reached 1.32 after HIU treatment at 80 W, which was attributed to the exposure of both tyrosine and tryptophan residues caused by the hydrophobic rearrangement of RSSDE protein. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that HIU altered the architecture of RSSDE proteins, resulting in more irregular pores. This work proved that HIU was a promising tool to shorten the salting period of RSSDE with much better quality.

J		Zhihui Yu; Ruonan Xu; Huiling Duan; Ling Ma							Comparative analysis of lipid profiles and flavor composition of marinated eggs from different species.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study compared lipid profiles and volatile composition in marinated eggs from different species (chicken, quail, and pigeon) using LC-ESI-MS/MS, and GC-MS, respectively. The three marinated eggs showed significant differences in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and neutral lipid profiles of the three marinated eggs. Pigeon-eggs contained the highest content of PE but the lowest content of triglycerides. Seventy-six potential lipid metabolites such as Cer (d18:1/21:0), DG (15:0/18:2), and PE-O (16:1/18:2) were selected for the discrimination of all three groups. Pigeon-eggs contained the highest contents of C18:2 and C22:6, as well as n-3 and n-6 PUFA than quail-eggs and chicken-eggs. Major compounds including 2-Nonanone, 1-Octen-3-ol, and cyclic octaatomic sulfur have greatly contributed to the distinction of eggs from different species. The highest levels of aldehydes, acids, and ketones were found in chicken-eggs. This study reported that lipidomic and volatile composition analysis are promising approaches for discriminating of marinated eggs from different species. Novelty impact statement. This is the first study that aiming at comparing the lipid profiles and volatile composition in marinated eggs from different species (chicken, quail, and pigeon) using LC-ESI-MS/MS and GC-MS. Pigeon-eggs contained the highest contents of glycerol phospholipid, n-3, and n-6 PUFA. The predominating volatile compositions of marinated eggs were alcohols aldehydes acids and ketones. Therefore, this study provides a better understanding of the quality of marinated eggs, and help customers to better choose higher nutritional values of marinated eggs. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16391					FSTA:2022-07-Qa0405

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Enzyme-modified butter is used as a common raw material to obtain a natural milk flavor. Butter protein is a by-product in butter processing that can be used as substrate to produce taste-active peptides, which can create additional value and new application opportunities, making the method more environmentally friendly. Results. Putative kokumi peptides from hydrolysates of protein by-products were isolated by gel filtration chromatography and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The isolated peptide fraction with the most pronounced kokumi taste was screened by sensory evaluation and electronic tongue analysis. Eleven peptides were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Six peptides were synthesized to verify their taste characteristics. Five synthetic peptides (FTKK, CKEVVRNANE, EELNVPG, VPNSAEER and YPVEPFTER) showed different intensity levels of kokumi taste. Of these peptides, the decapeptide CKEVVRNANE had the highest kokumi intensity. Conclusion. The newly identified kokumi peptides increased the kokumi taste intensity and showed some synergistic effect with umami taste. Both termini of the peptides seem to play an important role in taste characteristic. Glu residue at both termini can increase the kokumi taste intensity. This work indicated that it was feasible to produce kokumi peptides by enzymatic hydrolysis of the protein by-products of butter. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	14	6668	6675	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12034					FSTA:2023-01-Pg0452
J		Zhijie Zhu; Caihong Wang; Liping Mei; Wenwen Xue; Chengyi Sun; Yiqun Wang; Xianfeng Du							Effects of soy protein isolate hydrolysate on physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility of corn starch with various amylose contents.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To explore the interaction regarding protein and corn starch with various amylose contents, high amylose corn starch (HACS), normal corn starch (NCS), and waxy corn starch (WCS) were co-heated with soy protein isolate hydrolysate (SPIH), and the physicochemical properties and in vitro digestibility of each of the three combined materials was analyzed. The SPIH inhibited the in vitro digestion of HACS and NCS, but promoted the in vitro digestion of WCS. SPIH restricted the hydration and expansion of NCS and WCS and increased their gelatinization temperatures; however, SPIH had no significant effect on HACS. It was found that the microstructure of the three types of corn starch were significantly different after freeze-drying because of the different distribution of water molecules in the samples with various amylose contents during gel formation. The setback (SB) and peak viscosity (PV) values of these three types of corn starch reduced with the increase of SPIH mainly because SPIH inhibits the interaction of starch chains. This research lead to a novel idea of using corn starch with various amylose contents in food.

Food & Function					As a natural active ingredient, lactic acid bacteria have potential anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, male C57BL/6J mice were given a high-fat diet (HFD) to establish an obese mouse model. Lactobacillus plantarum 23-1 (LP23-1) with prebiotic characteristics was intervened for 8 weeks to evaluate its remission effect on obese animals and related mechanisms. The effects of LP23-1 on lipid accumulation and intestinal inflammation in HFD-fed mice were systematically evaluated by detecting lipid accumulation, blood lipid level, pathological changes in the liver and small intestine, oxidative stress and inflammatory cell level, lipid transport-related gene expression, the inflammatory signaling pathway, and intestinal tight junction (TJ) mRNA and protein expression. The results showed that LP23-1 could significantly reduce the body weight and fat index of HFD-fed mice, improve the lipid levels of serum and liver, reduce the histopathological damage to the liver and small intestine, and alleviate oxidative stress and inflammatory response caused by obesity. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis showed that LP23-1 could regulate the mRNA expression of lipid transport-related genes; activate the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway; reduce intestinal inflammation; improve the mRNA and protein expression of intestinal TJ proteins zona occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin, claudin-1, and Muc2; repair intestinal mucosal injury; and enhance intestinal barrier function. The aforementioned results showed that LP23-1 through the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway and intestinal barrier function reduced obesity symptoms. This study provided new insights into the mechanism of LP23-1 in reducing obesity and provided a theoretical basis for developing new functional foods. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	11	5971	5986	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04316a					FSTA:2022-10-Aj17959

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Obesity has become a worldwide public health problem. Lactic acid bacteria have attracted extensive attention for alleviating obesity and fat accumulation. This study aimed to evaluate the alleviating effects of Lactobacillus paracasei 24 (LP24) on lipid accumulation in an obese mouse model induced by a high-fat diet (HFD). The results showed that LP24 treatment significantly reduced body weight and fat deposition in HFD mice, improved blood lipid levels and liver steatosis, reduced liver oxidative stress injury and the inflammatory response, and regulated fat metabolism-related factors. Moreover, LP24 regulated the abundance and diversity of the gut microbiota, reduced the abundance of Firmicutes and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B), and increased the abundance of Akkermansia. In summary, LP24 regulates lipid metabolism by activating the expression level of related genes and regulating the gut microbiota through the gut-liver axis to attenuate the development of obesity. This study provides a theoretical basis for probiotics to regulate gut microbiota to reduce lipid accumulation.										2022	70	15	4631	4643	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07884					FSTA:2022-08-Ad13857

Food & Function					Recently, Dendrobium officinale polysaccharide (DOP), a typical acetylated glucomannan, has been widely applied in functional foods owing to its excellent bioactivity. However, the insufficiency of studies on in vivo process severely limits the further utilization of DOP. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the gastrointestinal digestive behaviour of DOP after oral administration by labelling it with two fluorescein aminopyrene-1,3, 6-trisulfonic acids, trisodium salt (APTS) and cyanine 7.5 (Cy7.5). Combining the results of NIR imaging and HPGPC, we found that DOP was poorly absorbed directly in the prototype form; instead, DOP moved with the intestinal contents to the distal part of the intestine, where Bacteroides aggregated for a prolonged time and was metabolized to oligosaccharide-like substances. In contrast, the digestive degradation of DOP in pseudo-sterile mice with a targeted clearance of Bacteroides significantly weakened, which provided the basis and direction for the subsequent search for more specific metabolic pathways of DOP in vivo. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	13	7274	7286	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01506d					FSTA:2022-11-Te4277

Food Hydrocolloids					Active agar (AG) bilayer films with bioactive capability and electrochemical writing property were developed for improving the postharvest quality of the banana. The antioxidant and antimicrobial capacity of the films were enhanced with the incorporation of red radish extract (RRE) and neem essential oil (NEO) into AG lower layer. The barrier and mechanical properties, retention of total anthocyanin and NEO content in the bilayer films were effectively improved with addition of TiO2 into the AG upper layer. Multicolor patterns were successfully written on the bilayer film containing RRE. The AG-TiO2+AG-RRE-NEO bilayer film exhibited the optimal preservations on banana fruits during the storage period, based on the characterization by fruits appearance, senescent spotting symptom, microbial analysis, weight loss and firmness. Thus, the AG-TiO2+AG-RRE-NEO bilayer film was expected to be a multifunction packaging material for banana preservation.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) was found to be the main cause of Guankou wine browning by investigating the browning index (BI) and the phenolic substances during the winemaking process. PPO was purified via temperature-induced phase partitioning, ammonium sulfate precipitation, and chromatography. The estimated molecular weights obtained by SDS-PAGE were 38 and 45 kDa. PPO was found to have an optimum pH and temperature of 4.6 and 30 °C, respectively. The minimum time required to achieve inactivation was 10 min at 75 °C. PPO from Guankou grape showed the highest binding affinity with caffeic acid, and a higher affinity for catechin than that from other grape varieties. The addition of ascorbic acid effectively reduced the browning of Guankou wine. Practical applications. Guankou grape is the main variety in Jianshi County, Hubei Province, China. The enzymatic browning process of Guankou grapes and PPO characterization after purification were investigated, and it was found that the unique PPO was responsible for the rapid browning of Guankou wine. A suitable inhibitor was also found to prevent that from happening. These results provide a more comprehensive understanding of the features of Guankou grape PPO, and may assist with the effective control of browning occurring during wine making. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16127					FSTA:2022-04-Hj3823
J		Zhilei Zhao; Xijun Wu; Hailong Liu							Vision transformer for quality identification of sesame oil with stereoscopic fluorescence spectrum image.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sesame oil (SO), as a high-priced edible oil, is often counterfeited and adulterated. A new method for SO quality identification using Vision Transformer (ViT) network based on stereoscopic images of Excitation-emission matrix fluorescence (EEMF) and Total synchronous fluorescence (TSyF) spectroscopy was proposed. The basic samples including pure, counterfeit and adulterated SOs were characterized by fluorescence spectroscopy. A data augmentation strategy including linear interpolation, shift and noise injection was selected for few sample learning. All fluorescence spectral data were visualized as stereoscopic images with rich spectral characteristics. The ViT network architecture based on attention mechanism was designed and trained to establish four SO quality identification models. The macro averages of precision, recall and F1-score on the validation set were greater than 0.99. The values of these indicators on the test samples were equal to one. In conclusion, deep learning based on ViT using stereoscopic fluorescence spectrum image provided a new method for sesame oil identification.

J		Zhili Ji; Long Yu; Qingfei Duan; Song Miao; Hongsheng Liu; Wangyang Shen; Weiping Jin							Morphology and rheology of a cool-gel (protein) blended with a thermo-gel (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose).		Foods					This study investigates the morphological and rheological properties of blended gelatin (GA; a cooling-induced gel (cool-gel)) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC; a heating-induced gel (thermo-gel)) systems using a fluorescence microscope, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and a rheometer. The results clearly indicate that the two biopolymers are immiscible and have low compatibility. Moreover, the rheological behavior and morphology of the GA/HPMC blends significantly depend on the blending ratio and concentration. Higher polysaccharide contents decrease the gelling temperature and improve the gel viscoelasticity character of GA/HPMC blended gels. The SAXS results reveal that the correlation length (xi) of the blended gels decreases from 5.16 to 1.89 nm as the HPMC concentration increases from 1 to 6%, which suggests that much denser networks are formed in blended gels with higher HPMC concentrations. Overall, the data reported herein indicate that the gel properties of gelatin can be enhanced by blending with a heating-induced gel. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhili Ma; Wei Wu; Dexin Zhang; Ping Wu; Yuanhua Guo; Deyuan Li; Fang Yang							Daily intake of up to two eggs for 11 weeks does not affect the cholesterol balance of Chinese young adults.		Food Science & Nutrition					Approximately 90% of the cholesterol content of the body is derived from de novo synthesis and the enterohepatic circulation. As numerous studies have shown previously, one egg per day intake has little impact of cholesterol balance in human body. Therefore, this study assumed that intake of up two eggs a day has little effect on biomarkers of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) risk in Chinese young adults. With the increase in egg intake, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and choline all increased among all the groups as the study progressed from autumn to winter (p<.05). However, there were no differences in the plasma triglycerides, LDL-C/HDL-C ratio, glucose, liver enzymes, C-reactive protein, and urinary microalbumin during the diet periods. Subjects who ate eggs at breakfast felt less hungry and more satisfied, which were relative with decreased fasting plasma ghrelin level (p<.05). Furthermore, egg-derived cholesterol appeared to upregulate the mRNA levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and downregulate cholesteryl ester transfer protein and flavin-containing monooxygenase 3mRNA levels in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results demonstrate that intake of up to two eggs a day had little effect on biomarkers of CVDs in young, healthy Chinese college students and provided useful evidence for the dietary guidelines regarding egg consumption. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zhili Ma; Yu Liu; Xi Feng; Salam A. Ibrahim; Wen Huang							Effects of different carriers on physicochemical and antioxidant properties of freeze-dried mulberry powder.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of three types of polysaccharides (dextrin, beta-cyclodextrin, and maltodextrin) used as carriers at various levels (1%, 3%, and 5%) on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of freeze-dried mulberry powders (MP) were investigated. The types and levels of carriers influenced moisture, solubility, total anthocyanin contents, and color profiles of MP. The MP produced with 5% of beta-cyclodextrin (MP-C) and 5% of maltodextrin (MP-M) were found to have the highest solubility, retention ratio of anthocyanins, and color values among all the MP samples. The addition of beta-cyclodextrin and maltodextrin decreased the particle size due to the increase of the spherical shape and the smooth surface. The MP-C and MP-M were found to show positive scavenging capacities on ABTS+ and DPPH radicals. Our results indicated that beta-cyclodextrin and maltodextrin had the potential to be used as a carrier agent to produce freeze-dried mulberry powders. Novelty impact statement. The types and levels of polysaccharide carriers influenced the physicochemical properties of mulberry powders. Mulberry powders produced with beta-cyclodextrin and maltodextrin showed valuable physicochemical characteristics.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The formation of complexes between plant proteins and polyphenols is being explored for the development for functional ingredients with new or improved properties. In this study, complexes were fabricated from moringa seed residue protein (MSRP) and tannic acid (TA). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that the main interactions between MSRP and TA were hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding. The MSRP-TA complexes had near neutral wettability (thetaow = 86.1°), which meant that they could adsorb strongly to oil-water interfaces and thereby form and stabilize Pickering emulsions. The stability of the emulsions was improved by optimizing the MSRP:TA ratio. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that higher tannic acid concentrations enhanced the thickness and compactness of the MSRP-TA interfacial layers formed around the oil droplets. The physicochemical properties of the emulsions were measured over a range of pH (3-9) and ionic strength (0-0.4 M NaCl) conditions. These results showed that the complexes were able to form stable emulsions at lower ionic strengths (<0.2 M) and higher pH values (pH 7-9). Overall, this study shows that self-assembly of MSRP and TA can improve the emulsifying properties of MSRP, which may increase its application as an emulsifier in foods.

J		Zhiliang Yu; Xuehui Wu; Junhua He							Study on the antifungal activity and mechanism of tea saponin from Camellia oleifera cake.		European Food Research and Technology					The purpose of this study was to isolate tea saponin from defatted C. oleifera cake and explore its potential antifungal activity and mechanism. UHPLC-MS/MS identified the compounds, and the antibacterial activity of tea saponin was determined by the inhibition zone method and double dilution method. In addition, the influence of tea saponin on the cell membrane, hyphae, and biofilm was studied to explore the antifungal mechanism of tea saponin. The results showed that the purity of tea saponin was 90.61%, and the main components of C. oleifera saponins were oleiferasaponin D3. Tea saponin has an apparent inhibitory effect on fungus. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the tea saponin against C. albicans, S. cerevisiae, and Penicillium were 0.078, 0.156, and 0.156 mg/mL, while the minimum fungicidal concentrations (MFC) were 0.312, 0.625, and 0.625 mg/mL, respectively. Tea saponin could destroy the cell membrane structure, which led to the leakage of cell contents and inhibited the growth of mycelium, reduced cell adhesion and aggregation, and effectively inhibited the formation of biofilm of C. albicans. Transcriptomic analyses indicated that tea saponin could down-regulate the expression of several hyphae- and biofilm-related genes (ALS3, ECE1, HWP1, EFG1, and UME6). This study confirmed that tea saponin from C. oleifera cake can be used as an effective source of natural antifungal agents and provide guidance on their utilization in the field of food safety. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	248	3	783	795	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03929-1					FSTA:2022-06-Ne1167

Food Chemistry					The effects of beef tallow, phospholipid, microwave, and ultrasonic pretreatment (MUP) on the Maillard reaction process, the sensory characteristics of Maillard reaction products (MRPs), and the composition and content of volatile compounds were studied. Maillard reaction of the sample was more intense after MUP, but more hydrophobic amino acids were generated, resulting in relatively high sourness in MRPs. Beef tallow encapsulation has no significant effect on the sensory characteristics of MRPs. The content of volatile compounds in MRPs added with phospholipids increased significantly, and the content of sulfur compounds (especially furan and furanthiol) increased most significantly. Hexanal, Nonanal, 2-Hexylfuran, 2-Hexylthiophene, and 1-Octanol were positively correlated with the value of umami and saltiness of MRPs. The addition of phospholipids after MUP and beef tallow encapsulation helps to increase the saltiness and umami of MRPs, reduce astringency, and produce more sulfur and other flavor compounds.

Food Bioscience					This study has presented the potential use of plasma-activated water (PAW) for the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) inoculated on blueberries. The generation parameters of PAW were optimized to a voltage of 8 kV, a frequency of 14 kHz, a processing volume of 30mL, and a processing time of 50 min. PAW treatments achieved significantly higher (p< 0.05) reductions than those obtained by water treatment in E. coli and S. aureus. As shown by propidium iodide and acridine orange staining, electron microscopy and optical emission spectra of plasma, the microbial inactivation of PAW was attributable to damage to the cell membrane and the denaturation of DNA induced by reactive oxygen species produced from plasma. During storage, PAW treatment was more beneficial to the quality of blueberries than water treatment. Thus, PAW immersion is a promising method for maintaining the freshness of blueberries.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The edible quality of starch paste formed by direct dispersion in boiling water is crucial to the design and production of instant starch-based products. In the present study, the kudzu powder was complexed with different chain-length fatty acids to improve its instant properties. The formation of V6-type kudzu powder-fatty acid complexes was initially characterized. Then, the impact of different chain-length fatty acids on instant properties of kudzu powder was characterized by measuring agglomeration rate and viscoelasticity. The agglomeration rate was decreased from 42.31% (native kudzu powder) to 0.08% (kudzu powder-myristic acid complex). Moreover, the viscoelasticity of the kudzu powder complexed with fatty acids (except for stearic acid) was stronger than that of native kudzu powder. These improvements were related to the formation of kudzu powder-fatty acid complexes with high thermal stability existed on the surface of complexed kudzu powder and extending the time for water to enter into complexed kudzu powder. Thus, all of kudzu powder could absorb sufficient water to avoid aggregating together that was involved into the formation of kudzu paste. This research had important implication for the preparation of instant starchy products that could be directly dispersed in hot water with high edible quality.

Foods					Pseudomonas lundensis is the main bacterium responsible for meat spoilage and its control is of great significance. 3-Carene, a natural monoterpene, has been proved to possess antimicrobial activities. This study aimed to investigate the antibacterial activity and mechanism of 3-carene against the meat spoilage bacterium P. lundensis, and explore its application on pork. After 3-carene treatment, cellular structural changes were observed. Cell walls and membranes were destroyed, resulting in the leakage of alkaline phosphatase and cellular contents. The decreased activity of Ca2+-Mg2+-ATPase and Na+-K+-ATPase showed the imbalance of intracellular ions. Subsequently, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and oxidative respiratory metabolism characteristics indicated that 3-carene inhibited the metabolism of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in P. lundensis. The results of binding 3-carene with the vital proteins (MurA, OmpW, and AtpD) related to the formation of the cell wall, the composition of the cell membrane, and the synthesis of ATP further suggested that 3-carene possibly affected the normal function of those proteins. In addition, the growth of P. lundensis and increase in pH were inhibited in pork during the 5 days of cold storage after the samples were pre-treated with 3-carene. These results show the anti-P. lundensis activity and mechanism of 3-carene, and its potential use in meat preservation under refrigerated conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Pseudomonas fragi is primarily responsible for the spoilage of various foods, especially meat. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial mechanism of 3-carene against P. fragi. 3-Carene treatment decreased the phospholipid content and the fluidity of the cell membrane, induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and affected respiratory chain dehydrogenase, oxoglutarate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase in P. fragi. Metabolomics and proteomics analyses further showed that in the presence of 3-carene, 519 proteins, 136 metabolites in positive ion mode and 100 metabolites in negative ion mode were differentially expressed. These proteins and metabolites were primarily involved in amino acid metabolism, fatty acid degradation, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) and other processes. Consequently, the stimulation of 3-carene altered cell membrane properties, disturbed important amino acid and energy metabolism, and even caused oxidative stress. Additionally, the results of total viable counts and the total volatile base nitrogen indicated that 3-carene could significantly improve the preservation of refrigerated pork. This study suggested that 3-carene has promising potential to be developed as a food preservative.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization in glasshouse fields greatly increases N loss and fossil-fuel energy consumption resulting in serious environmental risks. Microbial inoculants are strongly emerging as potential alternatives to agrochemicals and offer an eco-friendly fertilization strategy to reduce our dependence on synthetic chemical fertilizers. Effects of a N-fixing strainPseudomonas protegens CHA0-Delta retS-nif on ginger plant growth, yield, and nutrient uptake, and on earthworm biomass and the microbial community were investigated in glasshouse fields in Shandong Province, northern China. Results. Application of CHA0-Delta retS-nif could promote ginger plant development, and significantly increased rhizome yields, by 12.93% and 7.09%, respectively, when compared to uninoculated plants and plants treated with the wild-type bacterial strain. Inoculation of CHA0-Delta retS-nif had little impact on plant phosphorus (P) acquisition, whereas it was associated with enhanced N and potassium (K) acquisition by ginger plants. Moreover, inoculation of CHA0-Delta retS-nif had positive effects on the bacteria population size and the number of earthworms in the rhizosphere. Similar enhanced performances were also found in CHA0-Delta retS-nif-inoculated ginger plants even when the N-fertilizer application rate was reduced by 15%. A chemical N input of 573.8kgha-1with a ginger rhizome yield of 1.31 * 105kgha-1was feasible. Conclusions. The combined application of CHA0-Delta retS-nif and a reduced level of N-fertilizers can be employed in glasshouse ginger production for the purpose of achieving high yields while at the same time reducing the inorganic-N pollution from traditional farming practices. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Zhiming Guo; Ping Chen; Limei Yin; Min Zuo; Quansheng Chen; El-Seedi, H. R.; Xiaobo Zou							Determination of lead in food by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy with aptamer regulating gold nanoparticles reduction.		Food Control					Lead ion (Pb2+) is a main heavy metal in food that causes heavy teratogenicity and carcinogenicity. In this study, a rapid and sensitive SERS method for detecting Pb2+ in food was established by aptamer regulating gold nanoparticles reduction. The reduction of HAuCl4 catalyzed by H2O2 is a slow process, and graphene oxide (GO) has excellent catalytic performance for the reaction, which enabled the system to generate gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) with high Raman activity. When the aptamer was introduced into the system, its binding with GO reduced the reaction speed. Upon adding Pb2+ to the system, the aptamer preferentially combined with Pb2+ and GO was released to accelerate the AuNPs production. The concentration of the AuNPs was proportional to the intensity of the added Raman signal molecule 4-MBA and the main Raman peak of Pb2+ appeared at 1595.80 cm-1. The ability of a novel aptamer (M4-16) and traditional aptamers (T30695, TBA) for Pb2+ determination was compared, and the concentration of the aptamer, HAuCl4 and heating time were optimized to build optimal detection system. After several pretreatment of the original SERS spectroscopy, combined with the comparison of various models, the first-order derivative preprocessing combined with competitive adaptive reweighted sampling model achieved the best performance (Rc=0.9966, Rp=0.9972), the detection limit for Pb2+ was 0.1 mug L-1. The combination of SERS technology and chemometrics is a promising method that could be used to achieve rapid and highly sensitive detection of Pb2+ in food.

Food Chemistry					This study investigated the fabrication of Pickering emulsion stabilized by rice bran-modified wheat gluten nanoparticle (RGNP) and evaluated the effect of rice bran-modification on lipid oxidation of emulsified soybean oil, with native wheat gluten nanoparticle (CGNP) as the control. Compared with CGNP, RGNP exhibited stronger antioxidant activities due to high content of polyphenols. RGNP were roughly spherical (mean size of about 250 nm) with balanced wettability (104.6 2.3°) and had excellent colloidal thermal stability. When used at a concentration of 1.5 wt%, both CGNP and RGNP could stabilize Pickering emulsions at varying oil volume fractions (0.20-0.85). For high internal phase emulsions, nanoparticles adsorbed at an oil-water interface forming an interconnected network structure, depressing the oxidation of soybean oil. RGNP as an interfacial antioxidant further improved the Pickering emulsion' oxidative stability. This work may expand the application of wheat gluten as an antioxidant solid particle in Pickering emulsion.

J		Zhiming Zhang; Junzhe Yu; Peng Cheng; Shuo Wang; Fangxue Hang; Kai Li; Caifeng Xie; Changrong Shi							Effect of different process parameters and ultrasonic treatment during solid osmotic dehydration of jasmine for extraction of flavoured syrup on the mass transfer kinetics and quality attributes.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					This study investigates the effects of different process parameters (sugar dose, sugar size, and ultrasonic treatment time) on the solid osmotic dehydration (SOD) process of jasmine flowers and the physiochemical characteristics of syrup. The kinetics of moisture loss, solute gain, and effective diffusivity during SOD were predicted by fitting the experimental data with the Azuara model, Weibull model, and Fick second law model. The results showed that the high regression coefficient (R2>0.9) and low chi2 value represented the suitability of the Azuara model for predicting equilibrium water loss and solid gain and the Weibull model for predicting both moisture and solute fraction in jasmine under different process parameters during SOD. A relatively high sugar dose (120% w/w, fresh jasmine flower basis) and moderate sugar size (6-20mesh) enhanced the moisture loss and solute uptake during SOD and produced more syrup. Furthermore, the high sugar dose (120% w/w) and small sugar size (40mesh) enhanced the diffusion of polyphenols and flavonoids in jasmine to syrup. The mass transfer rate and syrup yield were increased, and more polyphenols, flavonoids, and antioxidant components were diffused to the syrup after applying the ultrasonic waves during SOD. Most flavour compounds of jasmine were effectively extracted by SOD under different process parameters, and alcohols (more than 68%) are the main flavour components of syrups, but the amount of major volatile compounds extracted was not affected by SOD process parameters. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	5	1055	1072	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-022-02787-3					FSTA:2022-09-Le1435

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The evolution of microbial flora was characterized during the soy whey fermentation process by Tibetan kefir grains by analyzing changes in bacterial and fungal community structures using amplicon sequencing. Moreover, changes in physicochemical indexes and active components were monitored. Acidity, pH, and oligosaccharides got a dramatic decline after 30h of fermentation, while the aglycones isoflavones significantly increased which resulted in a noticeable increase of DPPH. Scavenging ability from 53.0% to 70.2%, and many new aromatic volatile compounds were produced. Yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria grew to more than 7 log CFU/ml after fermentation. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus and Acetobacter changed dramatically in fermented soy whey, which can be ascribed to the increase in aglycone isoflavones levels, especially genistein. This research may deepen the understanding of the mechanism in the fermentation of soy whey by Tibetan kefir grains, and provide a scientific basis for the utilization of soy whey. Novelty impact statement. The fermentation process of soy whey by Tibetan kefir grains was studied. Yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria grew to more than 7 log CFU/ml after fermentation, and Acetobacter became the dominant genus. Aglycone isoflavones and amino acid nitrogen significantly increased, and DPPH. Scavenging ability increased to 70.2%.

Journal of Food Science					Cathepsin B is a cysteine protease that has important effects on the quality of muscle products. In this study, the changes of cathepsin B activity and its relation to muscle proteins were investigated in intact and beheaded shrimp during chilled and frozen storage. The obtained results indicated that the water holding capacity (WHC), shear force, hardness, and myofibrillar protein (MP) content all significantly decreased in both the intact and beheaded shrimp samples with increasing storage period (p< 0.05). Specifically, beheading shrimp exhibited much more stable characteristics than intact shrimp samples during both chilled and frozen storage. The enzyme activity results suggested that cold temperature and storage induced the release of cathepsin B from the lysosomes to the mitochondria, sarcoplasm, and myofibrils in the muscle tissues. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that beheading the shrimp greatly inhibited the dissociation of shrimp muscle proteins during storage. The current findings suggest that cathepsin B located in the head of shrimp was likely transferred to the muscle through the first abdominal segment during storage, accelerating the dissociation of the muscle proteins. Therefore, beheading the shrimp was conducive to prolonging the shelf-life of stored shrimp products. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	4	1610	1623	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16105					FSTA:2022-07-Re3082

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Fruit loading and packaging are still labor-intensive tasks during postharvest commercialization, of which the key issues is to realize the real-time detection and adjustment of fruit posture. However, fruit stem/calyx position is a key structural characteristic for fruit posture and will also affect fruit internal quality detection. In this paper, an image acquisition system based on fruit posture adjustment equipment was set up, and the YOLO-v5 algorithm based on deep learning was used to study the real-time recognition of stem/calyx of apples. First, hyperparameters were determined, and the training method of transfer learning was used to obtain better detection performance; then the networks with different widths and depths were trained to find the best baseline detection net; finally, the YOLO-v5 algorithm was optimized for this task by using detection head searching, layer pruning and channel pruning. The results showed that under the same setting conditions, YOLO-v5s had a more superior usability and could be selected as the baseline network considering detection performance, model weight size, and detection speed. After optimization, the complexity of the algorithm was further reduced. The model parameters and weight volume were decreased by about 71 %, while mean Average Precision (mAP) and F1-score (F1) were only decreased by 1.57 % and 2.52 %, respectively. The optimized algorithm could achieve real-time detection under CPU condition at a speed of 25.51 frames per second (FPS). In comparison with other deep learning target detection algorithms, the algorithm used in this paper was similar to other lightweight networks in complexity. Its mAP and F1 were 0.880 and 0.851, respectively. This was better than other one-stage object detection algorithms in detection ability, only lower than that of Faster R-CNN. The optimized YOLO-v5s achieved 93.89 % accuracy in fruit stem/calyx detection for different cultivars of apples. This research could lay the foundation for the automation of fruit loading and packing systems.

Journal of Food Science					Drying is the key process through which the aroma of tencha forms. However, the effects of drying method on volatiles are unknown. We compared tencha-ro drying with regular drying. Volatiles in tencha infusions were extracted using headspace solid-phase microextraction and solvent-assisted flavor evaporation combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Partial least squares (PLS), odor activity value (OAV), and heat map analyses were performed to identify the optimal drying method for creating a seaweed-like aroma. Changes in the key volatile compounds of the samples were investigated. The tencha infusions contained 125 volatiles with nine chemical structures. According to the sensory evaluation, tencha-ro drying was the optimal method for producing high-quality tencha with an intense and consistent seaweed-like aroma. The PLS model accurately distinguished among the types of tencha. By combining OAVs with screening through multivariate statistical analysis, six volatile compounds were revealed to contribute substantially to tencha's seaweed-like aroma: 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methylpyrazine, 2-ethyl-5-methylpyrazine, dimethyl sulfide, beta-ionone, and 2-formyl-1-methylpyrrole. The findings provide a theoretical basis and technical guidance for the processing of high-quality tencha with a strong seaweed-like aroma. Practical Application. This study demonstrated that tencha-ro drying contributes to the formation of a seaweed-like aroma in tencha and provides theoretical guidance for tea factories to use the appropriate drying methods for high-quality tencha. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	8	3355	3365	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16245					FSTA:2022-12-Hn11140

Food Chemistry					Human bitter taste receptor TAS2R14 (T2R14) can widely perceive bitterness, which has always been an issue for people to overcome. This study was aimed at identifying bioactive peptides obtained from Oncorhynchus mykiss nebulin hydrolysates as bitter taste receptor blockers by physicochemical property prediction, molecular docking, and in vitro determination of bitterness intensity using electronic tongue. Exploration of the interaction mechanism of these peptides with T2R14 by molecular docking models indicated that peptides ADM and ADW had high affinities for T2R14 to block the binding of bitter substances into the receptor. Addition of ADM and ADW to quinine caused reduction in bitterness intensity, with IC50 values of 420.326.26 muM and 403.294.10 muM, respectively. Hydrogen bond interaction and hydrophobic interaction were responsible for manifesting the high affinities of these peptides for the receptor. Residues Thr86, Asp168, and Phe247 may be the key amino acids within the binding site.

Food Research International					The kidney is an important target organ in the treatment of hypertension, but the effect of peptide QIGLF with antihypertensive activity on kidneys remains unknown. In the work, we aimed to further understand the hypotensive effects of QIGLF in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) using widely targeted metabolomics technology to investigate the kidney metabolic profiling variations. After four weeks of oral administration, the results showed different renal metabolomics profiles between QIGLF and model groups. Besides, a total of 10 potential biomarkers were identified, that is, 3-hydroxybutanoate, 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 19(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, 15-oxoETE, L-ornithine, malonate, uridine, uridine 5′-monophosphate, argininosuccinic acid, and N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate. These metabolites might exhibit antihypertensive activity of QIGLF by regulating synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, arachidonic acid metabolism, pyrimidine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis. These findings suggest that QIGLF might alleviate hypertension by inhibiting renal inflammation, promoting natriuresis, and regulating renal nitric oxide production.

Food Hydrocolloids					Hydrogel matrixes with diverse adjustable functions have grabbed a lot of attention in the fields of food and biomedicine. However, due to potential biotoxicity, and high energy consumption, chemically crosslinked synthetic hydrogels are typically subjected to certain limitations during their application. This research highlights the role of physical methods in engineering novel composite hydrogels from natural polysaccharides Salecan and Gellan without any structural modification and chemical crosslinking. The rheological properties of the hydrogels were investigated to determine their flow and gel characteristics. Moreover, with the aid of Power Law, Herschel-Bulkley and Arrhenius models, the key rheological parameters are further explored and compared in detail.

Food Bioscience					China has a unique treasure house of medicine food homology plant resources. These resources provide both nutrition and bacterial infection prevention. With the rapid development of modern science and technology, the pursuit of health and food safety continues to grow. Advocating green health and paying attention to new natural food preservatives has become a new consumer trend. Here, we prepared a compound solution by combining ethanol extracts from three medicine food homology plants: Siraitia grosvenorii, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Alpinia oxyphylla. The antimicrobial activities of the compound solution were investigated using five common food spoilage microorganisms as target strains: Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Rhizopus, and Aspergillums niger. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) for each target strain, and further examined the effects of various environmental factors on antimicrobial activity. Our results indicate that the compound solution effectively inhibited the growth of S. aureus and Rhizopus at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 7.81mg/mL. It also inhibited the growth of B. subtilis, E. coli, and A. niger at a minimum inhibitory concentration of 15.6mg/mL. Furthermore, the compound solution was stable under heat, ultraviolet, and light treatments, and was effective in the pH range of 3-5. Adding salt or sucrose to the compound mixture increased the antimicrobial effect synergistically, and added Fe3+ and Fe2+ also enhanced the antimicrobial activity of the compound solution. Therefore, our compound solution could be considered as a natural and effective antibacterial and antiseptic agent for food.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This work investigated the microbial community in Kantuan-sliced chicken during retail storage at different temperatures (4 1°C and 25 1°C). Compared with the samples stored at 25°C, a lower storage temperature (4°C) could prolong the shelf life of Kantuan-sliced chicken, as revealed by a lower change rate in pH value, total volatile basic nitrogen, and total viable counts. For the freshly prepared chicken sample, the microbial community was mainly dominated by the genus of Psychrobacter (71.67%), which is a member of Moraxellaceae family. During refrigerated storage, the genus of Brochothrix (belonging to Listeriaceae family) occupied the dominant position with a relative abundance at a level of ≥ 50% throughout the whole storage period, accompanied by the phenomenon that Psychromonas ranged from 12.32% to 22.54%. In the 25°C group, the samples presented rich microbial diversity. Enterococcus, Fusobacterium, Maccoroccus, and Lactococcus were the main components of the microbial community in the middle and late stages of storage. The microbial community of Kantuan-sliced chicken was quite sensitive to storage temperature. The results indicated that the spoilage bacteria of refrigerated samples were mainly composed of Gram-positive bacteria when compared to the samples stored at 25°C. It seems that the combination of low storage temperature with preservatives for Gram-positive bacteria would be useful for Kantuan-sliced chicken. Novelty impact statement. Kantuan-sliced chicken is a popular food product (ready-to-eat food) in middle China, which is easy to deteriorate. This study clarified the microbial community diversity and dynamics in the Kantuan-sliced chicken during storage at 4°C and 25°C to solve the unclear spoilage process. Our results extend the understanding of microbial spoilage of Kantuan-sliced chicken and provide valuable microbial management information for both researchers and the food industry, which is helpful for further improving product quality management. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16614					FSTA:2022-09-Sn4811

Food Chemistry					Hundreds of phospholipid (PL) species with defined fatty acid (FA) composition have been identified previously in bovine milk using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Paterno-Buchi photochemical reaction coupled with LC-MS/MS was applied in this study to further unravel the regio-distribution and double bond (DB) locations of FAs. Using SPE-purified PLs and 2-acetylpyridine as the photochemical derivatization reagent, we were able to reveal the non-specific regio-distribution of unsaturated FAs and the widespread occurrence of regioisomers in milk PLs. Although Delta9 and Delta9,12 were found to be the predominant DB location(s) for C18:1 and C18:2 respectively, other DB positional isomers such as C18:1Delta11, C18:1Delta12 and C18:1Delta13 and C18:2Delta9,11 were widely detected in PL structures, implying that the minor isomers of C18:1 and C18:2 equally participate in the synthesis of PLs. Our study provides novel information on the fine structure of milk PLs and further underlines the complexity of milk lipid composition.

Food Chemistry					In the present study, the effects of high-pressure processing (HPP) on the binding capacity, structural properties, antioxidant capacity and stability of rhamngalacturonan I (RG-I) pectin and cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) were investigated. HPP was found to have a positive effect on the binding between the two molecules, and the binding rate was increased by 32.8% after treatment (500 MPa/15 min). The increase in the binding rate is mainly due to the influence of high pressure on noncovalent effects such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobicity. The results indicate that high pressure can be used to maintain the antioxidant capacity of C3G and improve the stability of C3G. The C3G retention rate is increased by 34.0% and 38.3% after heat treatment and simulated digestion, respectively. The results indicate that HPP improved stability of the C3G-RG-I pectin complex through interaction between C3G and RG-I pectin.

Food Hydrocolloids					In the present study, the in vitro fermentation by human gut microbiota of alkali-extraction citrus pectin (AK) and high pressure-alkali-extraction citrus pectin (HPAK) were investigated. The monosaccharide composition analysis showed that both AK and HPAK had a high ratio of Rhamngalacturonan I (RG-I) structure. After 48 h of fermentation, 85%-86% of total carbohydrate was utilized by colonic microbiota. The pH value in the fecal fermentation liquid significantly decreased during fermentation. AK and HPAK significantly promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids, especially propionic and n-butyric acids. They also increased the abundance of potential beneficial genera (i.e. Bifidobacterium and Phascolarctobacterium) and decreased the abundance of potential harmful genera (Escherichia-Shigella and Klebsiella).

A total of 73 volatiles were identified during fermentation via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Fermentation enriched the variety of volatile flavor compounds, while reduced the unpleasant flavors such as (E)-2-octenal, nonanal, decanal, and 1-octen-3-ol. The species of volatile flavor compounds of the fermented mung bean flour with L. lactis RQ1066 was more abundant than that of L. casei GL8072.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Social stress and unhealthy diets lead to memory impairment, triggering health problems. This study aimed to determine the mitigating effect and regulation mechanism of sea cucumber peptides (SCP) against memory impairment. Here, scopolamine-induced memory impairment in mouse and rat models was used based on behavioral tests, a histological staining technique, Fourier transform infrared microscopy, and gas-chromatographic analysis as well as a Western blotting method. SCP improved the behavioral performance and regulated the disorder of the cholinergic system in mouse models in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, the underlying mechanism was explored in high-dose SCP using mouse and rat models. SCP repaired damaged neuronal cells, enhanced the Nissl body number, increased the unsaturated lipid level, and activated the long-term potentiation (LTP) pathway (p-CaMKII, p-CREB, and BDNF), both in the mouse and rat hippocampus. The results indicated that SCP upregulated the LTP pathway and unsaturated lipid level to combat scopolamine-induced memory impairment, suggesting that SCP was a potential candidate for neurological recovery.										2022	70	1	157	170	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06475					FSTA:2022-05-Rg1847

Food Chemistry					Exogenous melatonin confers the chilling tolerance of banana fruit by promoting reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system and inducing the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. The results showed that melatonin treatment increased the contents of phospholipids, promoted the ROS scavenging enzyme, and restrained the activities of lipoxygenase (LOX), and thus reduced the lipid peroxidation of banana peel. In addition, melatonin treatment increased the flavonoids and proline contents, which was conducive to antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, the enhanced antioxidant capacity is conducive to the stability of unsaturated fatty acids and reduce the enzymatic browning reaction. Moreover, melatonin treatment induced the expression of omega-3/6 fatty acid desaturase and triggered the fatty acid metabolism activity, by which maintained higher contents of unsaturated fatty acid in banana peel. Moreover, melatonin treatment stimulated the accumulation of fatty acids in banana peel, and was involved in alleviating fruit chilling injury.

J		Zhiqiang Wang; Yuxian Zhang; Hongyuan Yan							In situ net fishing of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) defatted seeds by combination of LC-MS/MS, molecular networking, affinity-based ultrafiltration, and molecular docking.		Food & Function					Defatted seeds of evening primrose (DSEP), the by-product of evening primrose oil manufacture, exhibit potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity; however, presently they are routinely discarded as waste. In this study, an in situ net fishing strategy was proposed for rapid recognition of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors from DSEP. Firstly, the DSEP extraction method was optimized employing a response surface methodology for the recovery of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, just like "finding a good fishery before net fishing". Then, molecular networks of DSEP were generated by GNPS-based molecular networking after LC-MS/MS analysis, just like "casting tight nets in the fishery". Subsequently, affinity-based ultrafiltration was carried out for fishing the "hit" together with its structural analogues according to the molecular networks, just like "hauling the specific net fishing". Finally, molecular docking analysis was performed to rapidly verify alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities of the potential bioactive components and predict their inhibition mechanisms. In the results, DSEP displayed significant inhibitory effects against yeast and rat intestinal alpha-glucosidase, and the results of an oral starch tolerance test suggested that DSEP showed postprandial blood-glucose-lowering activity. Moreover, 1-galloyl-glucose, gallic acid, methyl gallate, 1,6-digalloyl-beta-d-glucose, and 1, 3, 6-trigalloylglucose were rapidly identified as potential alpha-glucosidase inhibitors present in DSEP. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	5	2545	2558	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03975j					FSTA:2022-06-Nh1275

Food Research International					As a thickening or stabilizing agent, exopolysaccharide (EPS) can significantly enhance food texture. However, the conventional analytical and screening methods of EPS have been unable to meet the current needs of industrial production, owing to low efficiency and heavy time-consumption. A simple and rapid qualitative/quantitative method is needed to accelerate the selection of high EPS-producing strains. Here, a high-throughput screening (HTS) program for EPS production was established in S. thermophilus by combining Congo red agar method (CRA, primary screening) and microplate colorimetric assay (MPC, secondary screening). The correlation coefficient (R2) between CRA/MPC and the phenol-sulfuric acid assay (a classical EPS quantification method) were 0.779 and 0.862, respectively, suggesting the feasibility of this HTS method. A mutant library (>300 colonies) of S. thermophilus was constructed using ribosome engineering strategy, and EPS-producing mutants with the titer from 50 mg/L to 200 mg/L were rapidly obtained by our developed HTS method, confirming that the HTS method is simple and efficient for the isolation of EPS-producing S. thermophilus. Taken together, this HTS method was developed for rapidly screening of EPS-producing S. thermophilus, which could be a valuable tool not only for the rapid detection of EPS production capabilities, but also for the screening of strain libraries from genetic engineering with desirable characteristics.

J		Zhiqiang Xiong; Huanlan Chen; Xin Song; Yongjun Xia; Lianzhong Ai							Rapid isolation of exopolysaccharide-producing Streptococcus thermophilus based on molecular marker screening.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. As a natural food additive, exopolysaccharide (EPS) produced by Streptococcus thermophilus can improve product viscosity and texture. The protein EpsA is a putative pathway-specific transcriptional regulator for EPS biosynthesis in S. thermophilus. Results. According to comparative analysis of EPS biosynthetic gene clusters, a conserved region of epsA (609bp) was employed to design primer pair epsA-F/R as a molecular marker for the isolation of EPS-producing (EPS+) S. thermophilus. Two EPS+S. thermophiles strains, AR333 and S-3, were band-positive, whereas Lactococcus lactis NZ9000 (non-EPS-producing, EPS-), Lactobacillus casei LC2W (EPS+) and L. plantarum AR113 (EPS+) were negative by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon bands using the epsA probe. This indicated good specificity of the epsA probe to EPS+S. thermophilus. Moreover, based on PCR screening with the epsA probe, 23 positive strains were isolated and identified as S. thermophilus from our microbial library and natural fermented milk with 141.3-309.2 mgL-1 of EPS production, demonstrating the validity of our molecular marker screening method. Conclusion. The designed molecular marker of epsA can rapidly screen EPS+S. thermophilus, which has potential application in the dairy and other food industries. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	2	862	867	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11398					FSTA:2022-03-Pl1370
J		Zhiqiang Xu; Qingli Yang; Yinglian Zhu							Transcriptome analysis reveals the molecular mechanisms of the novel Lactobacillus pentosus pentocin against Bacillus cereus.		Food Research International					The objective of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect and mechanism of Lactobacillus pentosus pentocin against Bacillus cereus. The dynamic growth of B. cereus showed that the pentocin had strong antibacterial activity against the strain. The antibacterial mechanism focused on cytomembrane destruction, biofilms formation, DNA replication and protein synthesis of B. cereus. The scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and flow cytometry analysis illustrated that the cytomembranes were destroyed, causing the leakage of internal cellular components. Transcriptome sequencing indicated that the genes (KinB, KinC and Spo0B) in two component systems signal pathway were down-regulated, which resulted in the inhibition of the spores and biofilms formation of B. cereus. The phosphorylation and autoinducer-2 import were inhibited by down-regulating the expression levels of LuxS and LsrB genes in quorum sensing signal pathway, which also suppressed biofilms formation of B. cereus. The K+ leakage activated the K+ transport channels by up-relating the genes (KdpA, KdpB and KdpC), promoting the entry of K+ from the extracellular. In addition, the pentocin interfered DNA replication and protein synthesis by regulating the genes associated with DNA replication (dnaX and holB), RNA degradation (cshA, rho, rnj, deaD, rny, dnaK, groEL and hfq) and ribosome function (rpsA, rpsO and rplS). In this article, we provide some novel insights into the molecular mechanism responsible for high antibacterial activity of the L. pentosus pentocin against B. cereus. And the pentocin might be a very promising natural preservative for controlling the B. cereus contaminations in foods.

J		Zhiqiang Zhu; Ruiqin Ma; Draganic, A.; Orovic, I.; Xiaoshuan Zhang; Xiang Wang; Jingjie Wang							Postharvest quality monitoring and cold chain management of fresh garlic scapes based on a wireless multi-sensors system.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Fresh garlic scape is popular for its unique tastes and special antibacterial effect. As a kind of seasonal vegetable, it has huge quality decay after harvesting, and usually by low temperature storage to approach the round-year supply. However, it lacks cold chain management directions and transparency, which depends heavily on the real-time information of the process environments and the quality of fresh garlic scapes. With the analyzed quality-related indicators, including temperature, relative humidity, gas composition and vibration, a multi-sensors information acquisition system based on wireless sensor network was designed and developed. Then, the process of the fresh garlic scapes supply were systematically analyzed and identified, and the proposed system was also evaluated using the monitored data in current practices. Results show that the transportation and cold storage occupies an important position in the typical garlic scapes supply process, which has continuous influences on the quality preservation. The developed system functions well, and the wireless multi-sensors nodes can real-time monitor environmental information with high data reliability. The data evaluation also demonstrates the association of the monitored quality-related data with the supply process stage. Meanwhile, it is the visualization of the quality-related data that enhance the real-time sensing of the quality in storage, the transparency of the supply process and the cold chain management level. Furthermore, the system should be further enhanced with the better data quality acquired by the nodes for better quality sensing and management of the fresh garlic scapes supply process. Practical Applications. Significant benefits of this work are anticipated on the postharvest and preservation of garlic scapes to the market and reduction of its losses in the postharvest chain. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13918					FSTA:2022-04-Te1649

Food Chemistry					Response surface methodology optimization based on central composite design was applied to extract flavonoids from the exocarp of three coconut genera. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and structures of the flavonoids were determined. The results indicated that the optimal extraction conditions were ethanol concentration, 60%; temperature, 50°C; time, 90min; liquid/material ratio, 40mL/g; ultrasonic power, 150 W. Under these conditions, the yields of green, red and yellow coconut exocarp were 366.03 7.57, 596.38 10.32, and 403.78 5.56mg rutin/g powder, respectively. The flavonoids exhibited eminent DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities with IC50 values of 0.01-0.02mg/mL. At a concentration of 2mg/mL, they exhibited antimicrobial activity against Vibrio parahaemolyticus,Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonellaand Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In total, 17 flavonoids and 5 phenolic acids were characterized by UPLC-IT-TOF-MS/MS; among them, catechin, kaempferol, and quercetin were abundant. Yellow coconut had a distinct flavonoid spectrogram from other genera and contained more methoxy flavonoids.

Food Chemistry					The present study sought to analyze the lipid profiles of oyster Crassostrea gigas from Yellow Sea (YS), East China Sea, and South China Sea (SCS) through the untargeted lipidomics strategy based on UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometry and multivariate statistics. The results elucidated that geographical differences had profound effects on the lipid content, composition, and lipid molecular profiles. Notably, oysters from the YS group contained the highest lipid content, including triacylglycerol, diacylglycerols, and the majority of phospholipid molecule species, while oysters from the ECS group contained most of the phosphatidylcholine species and the SCS group contained most of the sphingolipid species. Totally, 1155 lipid molecular species belonging to 21 subclasses were identified; of them, 45 lipid molecular species could serve as differential marker for lipid of oysters from different sea areas. Overall, lipidomics could be a potential approach for discrimination of lipid characters between marine shellfishes for geographical origin traceability.

J		Zhiqing Tian; Qiujin Zhu; Yuanshan Chen; Ying Zhou; Ke Hu; Hongying Li; Kuan Lu; Jie Zhou; Yuan Liu; Xi Chen							Studies on flavor compounds and free amino acid dynamic characteristics of fermented pork loin ham with a complex starter.		Foods					Staphylococcus simulans and Lactobacillus plantarum screened from Guizhou specialty food were used to prepare fermented pork loin ham. The sensory qualities and flavor profiles of fermented pork loin hams from 0 to 42 days were investigated in order to reveal the dynamics of fermented pork loin ham. The results show that total free amino acids (TFAA) content reached the highest value on the 35th day, and the umami amino acids, including aspartic acid (ASP), glutamic acid (GLU), glycine (GLY), and alanine (ALA), were the main amino acids in all periods. Notably, the RV coefficient (0.875) indicates that free amino acids (FAA) are highly correlated with the sensory score of the E-tongue. In terms of the volatile compounds identified, the esters content gradually increased between 7 and 42 days, and ethyl octanoate was the most abundant compound during all periods. These esters imparted a characteristic aroma component to the fermented pork loin ham. The most important finding was that the increase in the content of esters represented by octanoic acid-ethyl ester might be related to the increase in the content of FAA with the increase in fermentation time. Both the E-nose and E-tongue showed good discrimination ability for fermented tenderloin ham with different fermentation times, which was crucial in cases with large clusters. In addition, the multiple factor analysis (MFA) indicated that the E-nose aroma value might be the key factor in distinguishing fermented pork loin ham with different fermentation times. © 2022 by the authors.

Osbeck) peel.		Food Research International					Brocade orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) peel, a by-product which is usually discarded in large amounts, is rich in a broad spectrum of phenols. Accordingly, this study investigated the distribution and natural variation of free, esterified, glycosylated and insoluble-bound phenols (FPs, EBPs, GBPs, and IBPs) in the peels. Regardless of phenolic fraction or peel position, the total phenol and flavonoid contents, and most tested phenolic compound contents were generally abundant during the immature and semi-mature stages but existed at lower levels during the commercial mature period. The flavedo was much richer than the albedo in a few phenolic acids, flavonols, flavones, and especially polymethoxyflavonoids, which was particularly true for EBPs. Flavanones, particularly in GBP form, were generally present in equal or even much higher levels in the albedo. The four phenolic forms exhibited distinct trends in terms of abundance. In the flavedo (except the young fruit stage) followed the order: EBPs > GBPsFPs>>IBPs, and in the albedo: GBPs>>FPsEBPs>>IBPs. Generally, the phenols examined for this study were highly abundant in the citrus peels, endowing this agricultural waste with great potential to be an excellent natural source of functional ingredients.

E., sr; Jianquan Kan							Optimization and comparison of nonconventional extraction techniques for soluble phenolic compounds from brocade orange (Citrus sinensis) peels.		Journal of Food Science					Brocade orange (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck) peels (BOPs) are rich in a variety of phenols with multiple and strong bioactivities. This study sought to utilize a response surface methodology to optimize the parameters of accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) to obtain phenolic extracts from BOPs. Total phenolic and flavonoid content (TPC and TFC), profiles, and antioxidant activities of extracts for free, esterified-, and glycosylated-bound phenols from ASE were compared with those derived from Soxhlet extraction (SE) (80°C, 6 h) and heat-reflux extraction (HRE) (80°C, 3 h). Maximum practical TPC and TFC under optimal ASE conditions (15min, 108°C, 82 bar, and three cycles) were determined to be 32.82mg gallic acid equivalents/dry weight (DW) and 10.25mg rutin equivalents/DW, respectively. The profiles, contents, and corresponding bioactivities of the extracts significantly depended on extraction method, particularly with regard to phenolic fraction. Generally, ASE and HRE were associated with higher levels of extraction efficiency and higher quality targeted bioactive compounds with stronger antioxidant activity. More importantly, ASE represents a simple, efficient, and time-saving technique for the extraction of phenols. Furthermore, the finding that different phenolic fractions contain variable profiles and contents of phenols is useful for efforts to obtain targeted individual bioactive ingredients and make better use of biomass residues. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	11	4917	4929	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16356					FSTA:2023-03-Jc5000

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The pre-harvest applications of antagonists are promising strategies to minimize various postharvest diseases. Given this, we sought to evaluate the capability of Pseudomonas fluorescens ZX in inducing resistance of postharvest citrus fruit against blue and green molds, caused by Penicillium italicum and Penicillium digitatum, respectively. Results showed that pre-treatment with P. fluorescens ZX significantly inhibited blue and green molds, generally providing stronger protection with increasing number of sprays. More specifically, three applications of the antagonist reduced disease incidence by about 47% and 41%, reduced lesion diameter by around 40% and 28%, and reduced disease index by approximately 69% and 57%, when exposed to blue and green molds, respectively. Mechanistically, these protective effects might be linked to the increased activities of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, and polyphenoloxidase, along with substantial response of phenolic acids (syringic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapinic acids) and flavonoids (rutin, neohesperidin, hesperetin, sinensetin and tangeretin). P. fluorescens ZX survived well on fruit surface, and more importantly, pre-treatments exhibited no negative effects on fruit quality; on the contrary, it partly improved fruit quality during postharvest storage. Collectively, these results indicated that multiple pre-harvest applications of P. fluorescens ZX are useful for control of postharvest diseases.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a serious worldwide health problem. Ginsenoside Rc is a major active ingredient isolated from Panax ginseng, whose pharmacological effects counteract oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation. However, it is still unclear whether ginsenoside Rc might exert beneficial effects on alcohol-induced liver injury. To this aim, mice primary hepatocytes (MPHs) were challenged with alcohol to test ginsenoside Rc's effects on their intracellular alcohol metabolism. C57BL/6J mice or SIRT6alb-/- mice were chronically fed a diet with added alcohol or given a single gavage of alcohol with or without ginsenoside Rc. Analyses of alcohol metabolism, oxidative stress, inflammation, lipid metabolism, and RNaseq expression were conducted to explore potential targets exploited by ginsenoside Rc to protect against ALD. Our results showed that ginsenoside Rc attenuated alcohol-induced liver injury by regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation both in vivo and in vitro. Ginsenoside Rc did increase the deacetylase activity of SIRT6, thereby lowering acetylated NRF2 levels, which elevated NRF2's stability, and subsequently exerting an antioxidant effect. In keeping with this, the hepatic knockout of SIRT6 almost abolished the hepatoprotective effects of ginsenoside Rc against ALD. Therefore, our results suggest that ginsenoside Rc attenuated hepatocytes' damage and oxidative stress in ALD by up-regulating the SIRT6/NRF2 pathway. Hence, ginsenoside Rc may be a promising drug to treat or relieve ALD.										2022	70	44	14220	14234	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c06146					FSTA:2023-03-Aj4943

Food Chemistry					To investigate the formation of typical melanoidin polymers, methylglyoxal (MGO) with NH3 or alanine (Ala) was used to form coloured compounds, with glyoxal or acetone used as controls. The products were characterised using chromatography, mass spectrometry, and spectroscopy. Spectroscopic results showed that the coloured compounds formed were similar to melanoidins in food. GC-MS results showed that the MGO-based reaction generated similar volatile compounds using the Maillard reaction. Mass spectrometry showed that the molecular weights of structural units in the polymers were mainly 162, 169, and 176 Da, and these could be reassembled using the basic units derived from MGO alone or in combination with nitrogen. Hence, polymers recombined using basic structural units should be considered while determining melanoidin biomarkers. The preparation of coloured compounds using MGO with NH3 can be used as a novel method to produce the control compounds for melanoidin after process optimization.

Food & Function					Obesity is a widespread medical problem, for which many drugs have been developed, each with its own limitations. Orlistat, a lipase inhibitor, functions as a fat absorption blocker and is a widely used over-the-counter drug in China. Psyllium husk, in contrast, is a food source rich in dietary fibre and is beneficial for weight loss because it reduces appetite. Here, it was investigated how psyllium husk treatments affect mice with a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, using obesity-related indices, metabolism indices, and gut microbiota, compared to orlistat treatments. Orlistat had a greater effect on weight loss, whereas psyllium husk had a greater effect at reducing serum and liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Treatments had similar effects on controlling the body fat rate, the expression level of farnesoid X receptor, sterol 27-hydroxylase and oxysterol 7-hydroxylase (CYP7B1) in the liver, and the regulation of major bile acids such as cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, and lithocholic acid in faecal content. However, the expression of CYP7A1 in the liver and the structures of faecal bile acids were different between the two drugs. Furthermore, although they also had similar effects on the gut microbiota at the phylum level, there were differences at the genus level for Roseburia, Bacteroides, Faecalibacterium, Coprobacillus, and Akkernansia, which led to the difference in the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) level. Orlistat increased the food intake of the obese mice that were fed a HFD, which led to an increase in water intake, serum triglyceride levels, and lower glucose tolerance. Although orlistat is considered a suitable drug for weight loss, psyllium husk is a comparatively more cost-effective choice for ameliorating hypercholesterolemia and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by a HFD. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	17	8829	8849	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01161a					FSTA:2022-12-Js16920
J		Zhiwei Chen; Fan Zhang; Lin Jiang; Zihan Chen; Hua Sun							Toxic effects of mycotoxin fumonisin B1 at six different doses on female BALB/c mice.		Toxins					Background. Fumonisin B1 (FB1) is one of the most common mycotoxins contaminating feed and food. Although regulatory limits about fumonisins have been established in some countries, it is still very important to conduct research on lower doses of FB1 to determine the tolerance limits. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of different concentrations of FB1, provide further evidence about the toxic doses-and exposure time-associated influence of FB1 on mice, especially low levels of FB1 for long-term exposure. Methods. Female BALB/c mice were treated intragastrically (i. G.) with fumonisin B1 (FB1) solutions (0 mg/kg body weight (BW), 0.018 mg/kg BW, 0.054 mg/kg BW, 0.162 mg/kg BW, 0.486 mg/kg BW, 1.458 mg/kg BW and 4.374 mg/kg BW) once a day for 8 weeks to obtain dose-and time-dependent effects on body and organ weights, hematology, blood chemical parameters and liver and kidney histopathology. Results. After the long-term administration of FB1, the body weights of the mice tended to decrease. Over time, FB1 first increased the relative spleen weight, then increased the relative kidney weight, and finally increased the relative liver weight. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), hemoglobin (HGB), white blood cells (WBC), platelets (PLT), and mean platelet volume (MPV) were significantly elevated after treatment with FB1 for 8 weeks. Moreover, exposure time-dependent responses were found for aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level, which were coupled with hepatic histopathological findings, necroinflammation and vacuolar degeneration and detrital necrosis. Linear dose response was also found for liver histopathology, in which, even the minimum dose of FB1 exposure also caused changes. Renal alterations were moderate compared to hepatic alterations. Conclusion. In conclusion, we demonstrated the systemic toxic effects of different doses of FB1 in female BALB/c mice at different times. Our data indicated that the effects observed in this study at the lowest dose tested are discussed in relation to the currently established provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) for fumonisins. This study suggested that recommendations for the concentration of FB1 in animals and humans are not sufficiently protective and that regulatory doses should be modified to better protect animal and human health. The toxicity of FB1 needs more attention. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.										2022	14	1			2072-6651				10.3390/toxins14010021					FSTA:2023-01-Cd0223

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					We have successfully constructed citrus essential oil (CEO, d-limonene is its main active component) nanoemulsion by the high-pressure homogenization method, whose droplet size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential were 34.23 nm, 0.235, and -25.87 mV, respectively. The effects of thermal treatment (-20-48 °C), pH (5-9), ionic strength (100-500 mM NaCl) and storage time (200 days) were examined on the physicochemical properties of all treatments. The antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion was tested by determining the minimal inhibitory concentration against the four foodborne microorganisms (Escherichia coli (10 mg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (0.150 mg/mL), Bacillus subtilis (0.312 mg/mL) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (0.312 mg/mL)). Especially, compared with pure CEO, the antibacterial activity of its nanoemulsion against S. aureus (0.150 mg/mL) and B. subtilis (0.312 mg/mL) was increased by 43 and 86 times respectively. Industrial relevance. In this work, we constructed robust CEO nanoemulsions based on a combination of emulsifiers via the high-pressure homogenization method, which bring new insights into the preparation of nanoemulsions. There is great potential for nanoencapsulation of natural compounds in the field of food preservation. Furthermore, the results may provide valuable data for industrial scale-up application.

Foods					Alfalfa polysaccharides (AP) receive wide attention in the field of medicine, because of their anti-inflammatory property. However, AP has high molecular weight and poor water solubility, resulting in low biological activity. We wanted to obtain highly bioactive alfalfa polysaccharides for further research. Herein, we successfully synthesized highly substituted sulfated alfalfa polysaccharides (SAP) via the chlorosulfonic acid (CSA)-pyridine (Pyr) method, which was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM). Under the best reaction conditions, that is, the reaction temperature, time, and ratio of CSA to Pyr being 55°C, 2.25 h, and 1.5:1, respectively, the maximum degree of substitution of SAP can reach up to 0.724. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy also confirmed the existence of sulfonic acid groups on SAP. Despite the increased average molecular weight of SAP, its water solubility is improved, which is beneficial for its biological activity. Further in vitro results showed that SAP exhibited better antioxidant activity and antibacterial ability than AP. Besides, the former can efficiently enhance the viability of oxidatively stressed intestinal epithelial cells compared with the latter. Furthermore, SAP has the potential to inhibit obesity. It is concluded that sulfation modification could improve the antioxidant, antibacterial, bovine intestinal epithelial cells' proliferation-promoting, and the obesity inhibition abilities of AP. The improvement of AP biological activity may provide references for the utilization of plant extracts that have weaker biological activity. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					In this study, we developed a prussian blue nanoparticles (PBNPs) immunochromatographic assay (ICA) integrated with smartphone-based detection device for ZEN in cereals. PBNPs, as probe labels, were synthesized with properties of controllable structure, environment friendliness, and high affinities to antibody (Ab). PBNPs-ICA quantitative analysis was performed with a hand-held smartphone-based device coupled with a user-friendly and self-programmed detection App. This integrated strategy demonstrated high sensitivity for ZEN with a cut-off value of 10 mug/kg, a detection limit of 0.12 mug/kg, a quantitation limit of 0.27 mug/kg, and recovery rates of 92.0%-105.0% and 88.0%-98.0% for maize and wheat, respectively. The results of 20 naturally contaminated cereal samples showed good correlation (R2>0.99) between LC-MS/MS and developed system. Moreover, the stability experiment revealed that PBNPs-ICA maintained high stability and bioactivity against competitive antigen (Ag). The proposed strategy exhibited great potential for the rapid monitoring of mycotoxins or other small molecule hazards.

J		ZhiWei Yang; MeiXin Hu							Effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on flavor characteristics of brewer's yeast-peanut meal hydrolysate/xylose Maillard reaction products.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, we investigated the effect of ultrasonic pretreatment on the flavor characteristics of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) because ultrasound enhances the Maillard reaction (MR). Brewer's yeast-peanut meal hydrolysate was subjected to an ultrasonic treatment, followed by a thermal treatment to induce the MR. Then, several properties of the MRPs were investigated. Compared to the untreated samples, the ultrasound-treated samples presented looser microstructures, which were conducive to the combination of xylose with amino acids or peptides in MR. Consequently, more intermediates were produced and a higher browning degree of the MRPs was observed, compared to those obtained by thermal MR. These findings were supported by the results of MRP analysis through fluorescence and FT-IR spectroscopies. The volatile compounds of samples treated by exposure to 200 W ultrasound endowed the MRPs with prominent flavor characteristics, as confirmed by the scores recorded using Electronic-tongue. Novelty impact statement. The flavor characteristics of the MRPs from the brewer's yeast-peanut meal hydrolysate have been reported for the first time in our study. Our findings demonstrate that ultrasonic pretreatment can improve the flavor characteristics of the MRPs, thereby supporting their use in the production of condiments. However, the benefits of the ultrasonic treatment do not always increase with the applied power. This study exploits an agricultural by-product as a raw material, fostering new ways to reduce waste and support a sustainable circular economy. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16699					FSTA:2022-11-Js15518
J		Zhiwei Zhong; Lei Zhou; Kaibo Yu; Fenghua Jiang; Jing Xu; Liqiang Zou; Liqing Du; Wei Liu							Effects of microporous packaging combined with chitosan coating on the quality and physiological metabolism of passion fruit after harvest.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The postharvest quality of passion fruit deteriorates rapidly because of intense physiological metabolism and serious water loss. It is difficult to solve the problems of water loss and microbial growth of passion fruit during room temperature storage at the same time by use of a single chitosan coating or microporous packaging technology. Therefore, a dual modified atmosphere microenvironment based on microporous packaging (MP) and a chitosan coating (CH) was established, and its effects on the quality and physiological metabolism of passion fruit were evaluated. The results indicate that MP can effectively reduce water loss and that the CH inhibits microbial growth. Combined application (MP-CH) is found to significantly inhibit fruit weight loss, which shows a value of only 11.17% on Day 12, while the weight loss of the control is as high as 51.57%. The ascorbic acid and total phenol contents of passion fruit in MP-CH are 5.63 and 37.00mg.100g-1, respectively, on Day 12, which are markedly higher than those in the control. The activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase in MP-CH on Day 12 are 3.20, 2.22, and 1.52 times higher than those in the control, respectively, which effectively improve the antioxidant level and reduce the accumulation of malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide. Furthermore, MP-CH delays the degradation of protopectin, cellulose, and hemicellulose by inhibiting the activities of pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase, cellulase, and beta-glucosidase. Consequently, MP-CH is a promising method for extending the shelf life of passion fruit to 12 days at 25°C by regulating water loss and physiological metabolism. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	8	1836	1850	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-022-02845-w					FSTA:2022-11-Jg15739

Food Chemistry					To valorise olive mill wastewater phenols (OPs) potentially applied in food preservation, a novel stable and regularly spherical OPs-AgNPs (Davg=78 nm) were successfully assembled in aqueous solution under the optimized conditions (pH 8.0,5 mM AgNO3, 35C and 30 min). The results of antimicrobial zone diameters indicated that 50 mug/mL of promising OPs-AgNPs presented excellent antimicrobial effects. Especially, the cell wall damages of E. coli ATCC 23,815 were caused when OPs-AgNPs concentration was exceeded its MIC (8.58 mug/mL). Also, a significant down-regulating of the Ca2+-ATPase activity in E. coli was revealed, and the intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were thus decreased from 12.5 to 1.35 g/mL after a treatment for 3 h. The apoptosis level of E. coli was significantly increased more than the control (55.13% of OPs-AgNPs vs 9.90% of control). In sum, OPs exerts enhanced antimicrobial function via penetrating cell membrane and targeting Ca2+-ATPase after chelated with AgNPs.

J		Zhiwen Qi; Xingying Xue; Xuefeng Xu; Hao Zhou; Wenjun Li; Guliang Yang; Pujun Xie							Detoxified and antimicrobial-enhanced olive mill wastewater phenols capping ZnO nanoparticles incorporated with carboxymethyl cellulose for fresh strawberry preservation.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The underutilized by-products of hydrophilicity olive mill wastewater phenols (OPs) have great antimicrobial potential. ZnO NPs is one of most wildly used nano material with anti-bacterial function as well. This study aimed to prepare the detoxified and antimicrobial-enhanced OPs capping ZnO nanoparticles (OPs-ZnO NPs) containing metal core of ZnO NPs and organic shell of OPs, respectively. The OPs-ZnO NPs was chemically coordinated/chelated driven by Lewis bases (NaOH) in aqueous solution. The results obtained by SEM and TEM showed that those irregular sphere OPs-ZnO NPs were ranged from 58 to 92 nm, with an OPs caption of 35.40% (w/w). Importantly, the in vitro results showed that the strategy of capping OPs in ZnO NPs decreased the toxicity of ZnO NPs (< 0.02g/L). Moreover, OPs-ZnO NPs presented a higher stability in simulated gastrointestinal digestion (Zn2+< 0.07g/L after 12 h). The results also showed that the protective coating of OPs-ZnO NPs and OPs-ZnO NPs/CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) enhanced the antimicrobial activity of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Aspergillus niger. Furthermore, the coating of OPs-ZnO NPs/CMC decreased the weight loss and the rotting ratio of fresh strawberry, and ultimately prolonged its shelf-life at least 4 days under 25 oC. Therefore, this study provided a biosafety strategy for the preparation of detoxified and antimicrobial enhanced OPs-ZnO NPs and its CMC protective coating for fresh produce throughout storage.

J		Zhiwen Shen; Shichao Li; Jinhong Wu; Faxiang Wang; Xianghong Li; Jian Yu; Yongle Liu; Xiayin Ma							Effect of different oil incorporation on gelling properties, flavor and advanced glycation end-products of silver carp surimi sausages.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Effects of deep sea fish oil (FO) and virgin coconut oil (VCO) incorporation on gelling properties, flavor and levels of protein-bound Nepsilon-carboxymethyllysine (CML) and Nepsilon-carboxyethyllysine (CEL) of silver carp surimi sausages were investigated. The gel strength of surimi sausages reached the maximum (916.768.38 g.cm) when 4 g/100 g surimi of FO were added. The FO had negative effects on the moisture distribution of the surimi sausages, making bound water migrate to free water, resulting in the increases of cooking loss (p>0.05). As the FO concentration in surimi sausages increased from 0 to 12 g/100 g, the levels of CML in the surimi sausages increased from 2.250.08 to 3.990.08 mg/kg (p<0.05). While addition of VCO had no significant influences on CML and CEL levels in the surimi sausages, as well as gel strength and moisture distribution. The addition of FO and VCO both improved the flavor of surimi sausages by reducing unpleasant flavor compounds (1-octen-3-ol, n-hexanol and hexanal) significantly (p<0.05). The sensory characteristics (odor, color and overall acceptance) were improved after addition of both types of oil. This study provided a strategy for flavor improvement and nutritional enhancement of reconstituted surimi products. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	16	6	5007	5022	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-022-01589-7					FSTA:2023-03-Rc1134
J		Zhixia (Grace) Chen; Buchanan, P.; Siew Young Quek							Identification and determination of compounds unique to Hericium in an edible New Zealand mushroom Hericium novae-zealandiae.		Food Analytical Methods					Hericium novae-zealandiae is a native mushroom traditionally consumed by the indigenous Maori of New Zealand. To study erinacines and hericenones, compounds reported to be unique to the genus Hericium, the small molecular lipophilic constituents of H. novae-zealandiae were evaluated by chromatography coupled with diode array detection. Ethanol was used as an extraction solvent for the detection and quantification of these lipophilic targets. Hericenone C was detected from the ethanol extract of H. novae-zealandiae, but erinacine A and hericenone D were not found present in this extract. A method coupling HPLC with DAD was developed to determine the quantity of hericenone C using a reversed-phase C18 column, with gradient elution consisting of methanol and 0.1% formic acid as mobile phases and detection at 295 nm. The validation conducted of this method included parameters of selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness, and all validation results were acceptable. Hericenone C was measured as comprising 0.75 mg/g dry weight of the mushroom. This is the first report of research on erinacine A, hericenone C and hericenone D in H. novae-zealandiae. This is also the first report of an analytical method suitable for the quantification of hericenone C in this species. More compounds unique to Hericium are expected to be reported when further investigations are carried out on this newly studied species of Hericium. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2022	15	1	67	74	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02098-x					FSTA:2022-11-Jq15380

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, residues and potential health risks of 16 commonly used insecticides and acaricides in 1633 citrus samples from nine cultivars in China were systematically analyzed. A quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe method combined with gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry was applied. In total, 77.3% of the samples were with residues, of which 57.7% contained 2-12 multi-residues. Etoxazole and chlorpyrifos were the top two detected pesticides with detection frequencies of 37.1% and 31.1%, respectively. Residues of eight analytes were over their MRLs with exceeding rates of 0.1%-2.4%. The safety of the nine cultivars ranked as lemon > pummelo > ponkan > satsuma mandarin > orange > citrus hybrids > "nanfengmiju" mandarin > "shatangju" mandarin > kumquat according to IqR values and related to the producing areas. Chronic dietary risks of the 16 insecticides and acaricides were negligible low for Chinese consumers. However, %ARfD of triazophos in most citrus cultivars for all population and of bifenthrin in "nanfengmiju" mandarin for children were beyond the acceptable levels, which indicated potential acute health risks. Application of triazophos, bifenthrin, profenofos and etoxazole in citrus should be controlled.

J		Zhixiang Cao; Yuxin Li; Chenchen Yu; Shengyun Li; Xuemei Zhang; Yiling Tian							Effect of high hydrostatic pressure on the quality of red raspberry wine.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In order to explore the influence of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on the quality of red raspberry wine, HHP technology was used to hold the red raspberry wine under the conditions of 200-600 MPa for 5 min/20 °C, compared with the red raspberry wine without HHP treatment. Then the changes in aroma components, ellagic acid content, alcohol content, colony-forming unit and sensory quality of red raspberry wine under different HHP conditions were evaluated. The results showed that HHP affected the aroma components of red raspberry wine. Principal component analysis showed that HHP treatment greatly affected the characteristic constituents of alcohols and esters. Simultaneously, it changed the content and composition of phenolic substances in red raspberry wine. For example, ellagic acid content was 35.15 mg/L at 400 MPa, which was 3 times higher than of normal pressure. No significant difference was found about the alcohol content of the wine subjected to HHP treatment within 400 MPa. However, the alcohol content decreased if it was higher than 400 MPa. In addition, HHP technology could eliminate the microorganisms. This research provides theoretical foundation for the HHP technology usage to red raspberry wine. Novelty Impact Statement. There are three main contributions from this research. Firstly, High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) has greater impact on the aroma of red raspberry wine with alcohols and esters. Secondly, HHP technology could increase the content of phenolic substances in red raspberry wine, while the compositions were also changed. More importantly, the content of ellagic acid that could inhibition of cancer were improved under HHP treatment conditions with 400 MPa in red raspberry wine, and the content of alcohol were reduced at the same time. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16030					FSTA:2023-01-Hj0434
J		Zhixin Wang; Gmitter, F. G., Jr.; Grosser, J. W.; Yu Wang							Natural sweeteners and sweetness-enhancing compounds identified in citrus using an efficient metabolomics-based screening strategy.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					With the high demand for a healthy diet, it is necessary and important to explore natural sweeteners used in food that enhance palatability but minimize calories. Citrus is considered a good potential source of noncaloric sweeteners, but to date, only one sweetness modulator has been found in this most common fruit crop. Herein, an efficient strategy based on an in-house database and the untargeted and targeted metabolomics analyses was proposed to screen sweeteners or sweet-enhancing compounds from citrus. Eight sweeteners or sweetness-enhancing compounds were screened out, seven of which were newly identified from the genus Citrus. Surprisingly, we identified naturally occurring oxime V, which previously was only known as a synthetic compound. The contents of five compounds, in 11 citrus cultivars or unreleased selections across two production years, were compared. Successful identification of these natural sweeteners and sweetness-enhancing compounds in citrus fruit indicated the potential to identify the relevant biosynthetic pathways and to breed new citrus cultivars containing these compounds that provided both palatability and lower sugar consumption. This study also demonstrated that the proposed metabolomics-based screening strategy could greatly boost the identification of taste modulators with low contents in natural resources.										2022	70	34	10593	10603	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03515					FSTA:2023-01-Tb0042
J		Zhixuan Yang; Xinke Duan; Jinyan Yang; Hongdi Wang; Fengxia Liu; Xiaoyun Xu; Siyi Pan							Effects of high hydrostatic pressure and thermal treatment on texture properties of pickled kohlrabi.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP, 400 MPa for 20 and 30 min) and thermal treatment (90 °C for 15 and 30 min) on the texture of pickled kohlrabi and their mechanisms were evaluated by in situ method, including low-field nuclear magnetic resonance, immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, etc. Results showed that HHP could better maintain pickled kohlrabi texture than thermal treatment, with the samples showing higher hardness, springiness, moisture content, lower moisture freedom, and more uniform moisture distribution. Moreover, HHP significantly decreased the degree of esterification of pickled kohlrabi pectin, indicating the potential effectivity for Ca2+-based texture keeping additive. HHP caused no further damage on kohlrabi microstructure or pectin chain. However, damage of microstructure and loss of moisture significantly contributed to the texture loss of thermal-treated pickled kohlrabi, which revealed the necessity for microstructure protection and water holding during thermal processing to maintain pickled kohlrabi texture. These researches could provide guidance for better maintaining the texture of pickled vegetables during HHP and thermal processing.

Food Chemistry					Pickled chayote is a Chinese fermented vegetable with unique flavors and is favored by local consumers. However, little is known about its quality changes and microbial community succession during fermentation and the relationship between microbes and quality. In the work, the physicochemical quality attributes (pH, acidity, nitrite, texture, and color) and flavor properties (sugars, organic acids, free amino acid [FAA], and volatiles) were investigated. The results revealed that organic acids, FAAs, and key volatiles (esters, terpenes, alcohols, and phenols) significantly increased during fermentation. Lactobacillus was the dominant bacterial genus with Lactobacillus alimentarius being the prevalent species; Kazachstania and Pichia were dominant fungal genera with Kazachstania humilis and Pichia membranifaciens being the prevalent species. The microbial metabolic network found that bacteria (L. alimentarius, L. futsaii, and L. paralimentarius) and fungi (K. humilis and P. membranifaciens) played significant roles in the physicochemical changes and flavor production of pickled chayote.

Food Research International					Although pickled chayote is a favorite Chinese fermented vegetable with high nutritional values, little is known about its bioactive compounds and antioxidant activities. In the work, changes of phenolic components and antioxidant activities in pickled chayote during 90 days' natural fermentation period were investigated. The results revealed a total of 15 phenolics were positively or tentatively recognized and quantified in pickled chayote. Among these phenolics, flavonoid aglycones (i.e., luteolin, apigenin, diosmetin, and isorhamnetin) significantly increased during fermentation (p< 0.05). In addition, total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, and antioxidant activities (ABTS and DPPH assays) were detected with the highest values in pickled chayote at the late stage of fermentation (56-90 days). Furthermore, pickled chayote could protect HepG-2 cells against H2O2-caused oxidative damage by the reduction of reactive oxygen species generation and the promotion of innate antioxidant defense system (p< 0.05). Correlation analysis showed that 8 phenolic compounds were highly associated with the increase of extracellular and intracellular antioxidant activities. Besides, Lactobacillus alimentarius and Lactobacillus futsaii could increase the content of apigenin derivatives and Pichia membranifaciens could promote the production of flavonoid aglycones. In general, fermentation is an effective approach to enhance antioxidant potentials of pickled chayote and thereby increasing its functional values.

Food Chemistry					Reliable analysis of phenolic compounds in fatty matrices is a challenging task. In this work, a robust analytical method was developed and validated for 55 phenolic compounds employing QuEChERS (quick, efficient, cheap, easy, rugged and safe) and Enhanced Matrix Removal (EMR)-lipid cleanup in 96-well plates for sample preparation, coupled with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS). Seven high-fat matrices of pork brain, belly and liver; horse serum, beef, salmon and avocado were explored for method validation and led to promising stepwise recoveries of extraction, clean-up, drying-reconstitution of most analytes ranging from 75% to 113%, and with an accuracy of 78%~117%, except for six catechin-analogues. The matrix removal efficiency of EMR was determined using UHPLC-quadruple time of flight (QTOF)-MS, and results indicated that 56%~77% of co-extractives were removed. This method would be readily extended to wide range of applications demanding high-throughput and sensitive analysis of phenolic compounds in fatty samples.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					This work evaluated the microbial reduction and quality change of the whole hulless barley flour (WHBF) treated by a continuous instant pressure drop (CIPD) sterilizer. The microbial reduction of WHBF was proportional to steam-material ratio under the conditions of 165°C, 0.2 MPa steam, and 0.2 MPa Laval nozzle, and the microbial reduction was 3.87 0.09 log cfu/g with the steam-material ratio of 3.0:1. The work was followed-up with the quality testing of CIPD, UV-C, hot air, and ozone treated WHBF. The microbial reduction of hot air, UV-C, and ozone treated WHBF was 3.98 0.09,3.33 0.04, and 3.68 0.12 log cfu/g, respectively, while the CIPD treatment achieved similar bactericidal effect at a unit treatment time of 22s. Moreover, there is no measurable quality degradation in CIPD treated WHBF compared with the untreated WHBF.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Effect of chitosan oligosaccharide (COS), a natural product of low-cost and non-toxic with high biological activities, on quality attributes of tomato during post-harvest storage was investigated. Mature green tomato fruit were treated with 0.5g L-1 COS and stored under room temperature. The results showed that COS was effective in improving fruit quality as revealed by redder color skin, higher content of nutrients such as carotenoids (lycopene and beta-carotene) and vitamin C, and increased emissionb of flavor-associated volatiles (1-penten-3-one, heptanal, (E)-2-heptenal, 2-phenylacetaldehyde, 2-phenylethanol, 2-isobutylthiazole and beta-ionone). The increased content of carotenoids upon COS treatment was correlated with the elevated expression levels of carotenogenic genes such as SlDXS, SlGGPS, SlPSY1, SlPDS, SlZDS, and SlLCY-B2. Moreover, COS-treated fruit exhibited accelerated occurrence of climacteric ethylene peak, enhanced ethylene production, and elevated expression of genes involved in ethylene biosynthesis (SlACS2, SlACS4, and SlACO1), perception (SlETR3), and response (E4 and E8), implying that COS might regulate fruit ripening and quality by enhancing ethylene biosynthesis and signaling. These findings help to extend our understanding of the function of COS in fruit ripening and provide a new strategy to improve tomato fruit quality during room temperature storage.

Food Research International					Aspergillus cristatus is the dominant fungus involved in the fermentation of Fuzhuan brick tea (FBT). The intracellular polysaccharides (IPSs) from A. cristatus (MK346334, NCBI), isolated from FBT, exhibited immunomodulatory activity in vitro while the effects in vivo on immune system and gut microbiota remain unclear. In this study, IPSs and the purified fraction (IPSs-2) from IPSs were prepared and their immunomodulatory activities were investigated with cyclophosphamide (Cy)-induced immunosuppressive mice. As results, IPSs strengthened the immune function, manifesting in the improvement of body weight, daily intake, immune organ indices, cytokines and immunoglobulin. Meanwhile, IPSs attenuated Cy-induced intestinal barrier injury and promoted the expression of tight junction proteins and mucin, reinforcing the intestinal barrier function. Moreover, IPSs not only promoted the production of short-chain fatty acids and the expression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR), but also balanced dysbiosis of gut microbiota through elevating the growth of beneficial bacteria while reducing pathobionts to maintain the homeostasis of the microbial ecology. These results suggested that IPSs exerted immunomodulatory activity linking with the restoration of intestinal barrier function and regulation of gut microbiota, which contributes to the development of novel probiotics and effective immunomodulators for strengthening host immunity and gut health.

Food Control					Mushroom poisoning is becoming a serious food safety and public health issue due to its high morbidity and mortality in some parts of the world. Identifying mushroom toxins at an early stage of suspected intoxication is crucial for therapeutic decision making. Ibotenic acid, muscimol, 2-amino-4, 5-hexadienoic acid and 2-amino-4-pentynoic acid are a group of amino group-containing mushroom toxins that can lead to hallucination and neurotoxicity on humans. However, there is no method established for simultaneous detection of the four toxins. In this present study, a new derivatization method was developed for the determination of these toxins in mushroom and urine samples by ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). After sample extraction the extract was directly derivatized by using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chloride and multiple factors affecting derivatization reaction were systematically optimized to enhance method sensitivity. Furthermore, liquid-liquid extraction with dichloromethane was employed for purification of the derivatized products. The method was fully validated for linearity, sensitivity, recovery and precision. Recoveries of four mushroom toxins were in the range of 85%-101% for urine and 82%-108% for mushroom. The limits of quantification were from 0.05 to 1mug/L in urine and 1-20mug/kg in mushroom. In addition, the developed method was successfully applied on mushroom samples treated by cooking and digesting with artificial gastric juice, demonstrating that vomitus as well as cooked mushroom and its soup can be used as the valuable materials for identifying mushroom poisoning caused by these four toxins.

Corn peptides (CPs) are rich in branched-chain amino acids such as leucine and have a variety of biological activities such as antioxidant and improved lipid distribution. In this article, we prepared CPs by enzymatic digestion of corn proteins and evaluated their anti-fatigue activity. Results. We evaluated the anti-fatigue effect of CPs through an exhaustive swimming experiment. The results showed that CPs were able to significantly reduce the rate of body weight gain and prolong the duration of exhaustive swimming. Besides, CPs reduced blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels after exercise, while they significantly increased muscle glycogen and liver glycogen stores. They reduced muscle cell damage from exercise. In addition, CPs were effective in increasing AMPK, PGC-1alpha and PI3K protein expression levels and promoting Akt phosphorylation. Correlation analysis showed that CPs increased the abundance of probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Akkermansia in the gut microflora. Conclusion. CPs, which enhanced exercise performance in mice and could modulate gut microbial composition, had significant anti-fatigue activity. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	8	3456	3466	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11693					FSTA:2022-09-Mc5334

Food Chemistry					Sea buckthorn polysaccharide (SBP) has received increasing attention for its various bioactive functions. In this study, a novel polysaccharide SBP-1 was initially separated from crude SBP and further purified to obtain its main fraction SBP-1-A with a Mw of 9944 Da, consisting of Rha, Ara, Gal, Glc, and GalA. The structure of SBP-1-A was characterized based on FT-IR, GC-MS, and 1D/2D NMR, and its backbone was composed of a repeated unit of 3,4)-beta-L-Rha p-(1 4) -alpha-D-GalA p-(1 4) -alpha-D-GalA p-(1 with branches at C-4 position comprised of alpha-L-Ara f, beta-D-Gal p, beta-D-Glc p, alpha-D-Glc p. Besides, the anti-obesity effects of SBP-1 on high-fat diet mice were evaluated, indicating it could restrain the body weight gain and lipids accumulation by promoting the expression of PGC1 alpha, UCP-1, and PRDM16 to activate the brown adipocyte and improve the thermogenesis. In summary, the results offered new supports for the structural information of SBP and its feasibility to be used as a natural anti-obesity reagent.

J		Zhiyuan Ma; Jiangqi Yao; Yiyang Wang; Jie Jia; Fuguo Liu; Xuebo Liu							Polysaccharide-based delivery system for curcumin: fabrication and characterization of carboxymethylated corn fiber gum/chitosan biopolymer particles.		Food Hydrocolloids					Polysaccharide-based biopolymer particles are known as biocompatible, sustainable and easy to be modified, and widely used in food and biomedical fields. In this study, a novel polysaccharide-based particle as curcumin (Cur) carrier was developed through self-assembly driven by electrostatic interactions between carboxymethylated corn fiber gum (CMCFG) and chitosan (Cs). Firstly, the chemical structure of synthesized CMCFG was characterized to prove successful carboxymethylation. Then Cur-loaded CMCFG/Cs particles (Cur-CMCsPs) with different mass ratios of CMCFG to Cs (1:3, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1) were prepared and their particle size, zeta-potential, crystalline structure and micro-morphology were determined. Smaller particle size was observed when the mass ratio of CMCFG to Cs exceeded 1:1, among which the lowest hydrodynamic diameter was less than 300 nm, as uniform spherical particles. Furthermore, the highest encapsulation efficiency of the resulting Cur-CMCsPs surpassed 93% and the Cur loaded in particles showed the excellent photo/thermal stability. Besides, the particles could significantly improve the bioaccessibility of Cur reaching 74.94%. This study provides strategy support for suitably designing biopolymer particles as delivery vehicles of hydrophobic nutrients in food and biomedical fields.

J		Zhiyun Peng; Yufeng Li; Lijun Tan; Lu Chen; Qiandai Shi; Qiao-Hui Zeng; Haiquan Liu; Jing Jing Wang; Yong Zhao							Anti-tyrosinase, antioxidant and antibacterial activities of gallic acid-benzylidenehydrazine hybrids and their application in preservation of fresh-cut apples and shrimps.		Food Chemistry					A series of gallic acid-benzylidenehydrazine hybrids were synthesized and evaluated for their tyrosinase inhibitory activity. Thereinto, compounds 5d and 5f potently inhibited tyrosinase with IC50 of 15.3 and 3.3 muM, compared to kojic acid (44.4 muM). The inhibition mechanism suggested that 5d and 5f not only chelated with Cu2+, but also reduced Cu2+ to Cu1+ in the tyrosinase active site. Additionally, 5d and 5f exhibited strong DPPH scavenging and antibacterial activities against Vibrio parahaemolyticu and Staphylococcus aureus, which can be attributed to the function of gallic acid and hydrazone moiety. These compounds also exhibited capacity to preserve fresh-cut apples and shrimps. Finally, 5d and 5f exhibited low cytotoxic activity in a human cell line (HEK293). Therefore, these compounds possess anti-tyrosinase, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities, and can be used in the development of novel food preservatives.

J		Zhiyun Wang; Yan Lin; Lu Liu; Baodong Zheng; Yi Zhang; Hongliang Zeng							Effect of lotus seed resistant starch on lactic acid conversion to butyric acid fermented by rat fecal microbiota.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The aim was to investigate the effect of lotus seed resistant starch (LRS) on lactic acid (LA) conversion to butyric acid (BA) fermented by rat fecal microbiota to construct an acetyl CoA pathway. According to growth curves, the microbiota compositions at 10 and 36 h were further analyzed. The microbiota in the LRS group had higher richness and diversity compared to glucose (GLU) and high amylose maize starch (HAMS). Moreover, LRS and isotope LA promoted the growth of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, promoted BA production, and inhibited the growth of Escherichia-Shigella. The BUT pathway played a dominant role in three groups. At 10 h, Escherichia-Shigella and Bifidobacterium showed a negative correlation with BUT and a positive correlation with BUK, whereas Escherichia-Shigella, Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Ralstonia showed a positive correlation with BUT and BUK at 36 h. [3-13C] LA was converted to [4-13C] BA by the isotope labeling technique. Finally, LRS promoted LA conversion to BA mainly by the BUT pathway in intestinal microbiota, especially including Allobaculum, Bifidobacterium, and Ralstonia.										2022	70	5	1525	1535	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06000					FSTA:2022-06-Jq7155

Production of plant-based seafood: scallop analogs formed by enzymatic gelation of pea protein-pectin mixtures.		Foods					This study investigated the possibility of using a phase separation, mixing, and enzymatic gelation approach to construct seafood analogs from plant protein-polysaccharide mixtures with properties mimicking real seafood. Heat-denatured pea protein (10%, w/w) and pectin (0-1%, w/w) were mixed to produce phase separated biopolymer blends. These blends were then subjected to mild shearing (350 rpm) to obtain fiber-like structures, which were then placed in molds and set by gelling the pea proteins using transglutaminase (2%, w/w). The appearance, texture, and cooking properties of the resulting scallop analogs were characterized and compared to those of real scallop. The presence of the pectin promoted the formation of a honeycomb structure in the scallop analogs, and microscopic orientation of the proteins was observed in the plane parallel to the applied shear flow. Lower pectin concentrations (0.5%, w/ w) led to stronger gels with better water holding capacity than higher ones (1.0%, w/w). The appearance and texture of the plant-based scallop analogs were like those of real scallop after grilling, indicating the potential of using this soft matter physics approach to create plant-based seafood analogs. One of the main advantages of this method is that it does not require any expensive dedicated equipment, such as an extruder or shear cell technology, which may increase its commercial viability. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zhizhen Bai; Jianping Tian; Xinjun Hu; Ting Sun; Huibo Luo; Dan Huang							A back-propagation neural network model using hyperspectral imaging applied to variety nondestructive detection of cereal.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Cereal crops play an important role in preventing chronic diseases and regulating human functions due to their rich phytochemicals. However, an increasing number of cases of cereal-crop adulteration are occurring, affecting the nutrition of food and threatening food safety. Therefore, this study used hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish the variety identification model of different grain shapes, colors, and sizes. This model can conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of samples rapidly and nondestructively, because HSI can collect spectral information and spatial information of samples. Meanwhile, the Watershed algorithm was used to identify cereal varieties by particles, and the model identification performance was verified by the unlabeled test sets. The results show that the data extraction success rate of the new watershed algorithm reached 98%, and the comprehensive identification accuracy of the model reached 90%. In addition, the cereal in the training set can be changed to identify other cereal crops, thereby providing a method of rapid and nondestructive adulteration detection of cereals. Practical Applications. Cereal crops play an important role in preventing chronic diseases and regulating human functions due to their rich phytochemicals. However, an increasing number of cases of cereal-crop adulteration are occurring, affecting the nutrition of food and threatening food safety. Therefore, this study used hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) to establish the variety identification model of different grain shapes, colors, and sizes. This model can conduct a quantitative and qualitative analysis of samples rapidly and nondestructively, because HSI can collect spectral information and spatial information of samples at the same time. The spectral information was used for qualitative analysis, while spatial information was used for quantitative analysis, so this model can realize the rapid and nondestructive detection of different varieties of cereals. And we can also change the training-set data to realize the variety identification of other varieties of crops, which provides guidance for the method detecting the adulteration of cereal crops. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	45	3			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13973					FSTA:2022-06-Ma3537
