Blume).		Food Research International					Although Kudingcha (Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.) Blume) has been widely used as both traditional medicine and food, systematic studies on their basic active components and quality control are lacking. In this study, a rapid method of identifying the general chemical components of Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.) Blume was established for the first time using UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap-HRMS, and its major basic components were specified as phenylpropanoid, monoterpene, and flavonoid glycosides. The characteristic cleavage pathways of the phenylpropanoid, monoterpene, and flavonoid glycosides were further investigated and elaborated, which could assist in identifying the structures of similar components of other Chinese herbal medicines. A breakthrough was achieved in establishing a chemical fingerprinting profile of Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.) Blume from its original growing areas in China, and chemometric measures were applied to investigate the causes for the variations in its quality stability. The results indicated significant differences in the characteristic compositions of phenylpropanoid and monoterpene glycosides between mature and young leaves of Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.) Blume; however, no significant variation was observed owing to different production areas. Graded harvesting criteria should be established, and harvest period should be specified according to the target active components while considering agricultural metrics, such as leaf shape index, leaf length, and leaf width, to ensure the consistency in quality of active components during their production. From the perspective of overall quality control, an unprecedented quantitative analysis of multi-components by single marker was set up to analyze the signature components of phenylpropanoid glycosides (acteoside, isoacteoside, ligurobustoside N, and ligupurpuroside B) to increase the analytical efficiency and reduce research costs. This study created a scientific basis for the standardized operation, elucidation of the pharmacological materials, and quality control of food and supplements production with Ligustrum robustum (Roxb.) Blume as a raw material. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	162	Part A			0963-9969				10.1016/j.foodres.2022.111937					FSTA:2023-03-Aj5784

Journal of AOAC International					Background. Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG) is a natural antioxidant generally extracted from flaxseed, which is one of the most important oil crops in China, the by-product of the flaxseed oil, i.e., flaxseed meal still contains a lot of lignans. However, flaxseed meal is generally treated as waste, resulting in a huge waste of resources. Objective. To establish an efficient and convenient method for extraction and purification of lignans from flaxseed meal. Methods. First, we used response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize the extraction conditions of the ultrasonic-assisted (UA) aqueous two-phase system (ATPS), and we obtained the purified extracts by macroporous resin purification (MRP). Second, the antioxidant ability of the extracts was studied in vitro. Results. The best extraction conditions obtained were as follows: 9.0% (w/w) sodium hydroxide; 30.0% (w/w) isopropanol; extraction time, 39 min; liquid-to-solid ratio, 52.0 mL/g; ultrasonic wave, 560 W; and extraction temperature, 40°C. Under the optimal conditions, the purity of crude extracts (SDG-APTS-C) reached 21.5%. The desorption conditions of MRP were as follows: eluting 3 BV with ultrapure water, and then eluting with 25% ethanol at 2 BV (bed volume)/h to collect eluents. The purified extracts (SDG-ATPS-P) had a purity quotient of 73.9%, which was 52.4% higher than that of SDG-ATPS-C. Additionally, experiments conducted revealed that SDG-ATPS-C and SDG-ATPS-P could effectively remove DPPH (2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2′-Azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonate), and hydroxyl free radicals in vitro. Conclusions. The method was validated for extracting SDG from flaxseed meal, thus achieving the reuse of flaxseed meal. Highlights. This research provides some references for the application of UAATPS combined with MRP in natural products. © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of AOAC INTERNATIONAL.

A food composition database for assessing nitrate intake from plant-based foods.		Food Chemistry					An up-to-date nitrate food composition database of plant-based foods is lacking. Such a resource is imperative to obtain a robust assessment of dietary nitrate intakes and facilitate more empirical evaluation of health implications. We updated and expanded our 2017 vegetable nitrate database by including data published between 2016 and 2021, and data on fruits, cereals, herbs, spices, pulses and nuts (1980-2021). Of the collated nitrate contents for 264 plant-based foods from 64 countries, 120 were obtained from three or more references. Despite substantial variations, leaf vegetables were the top nitrate-containing foods, followed by stem & shoot vegetables, herbs and spices, root vegetables, flower vegetables, tuber vegetables, nuts, fruit vegetables, legume/seed vegetables, fruits and cereals. Banana and strawberry contained far higher amounts of nitrate than previously recognised. In conjunction with the recent animal-based food nitrate & nitrite database, this database can now be used to evaluate dietary nitrate intake in clinical and epidemiological studies.

Development of a food composition database for assessing nitrate and nitrite intake from animal-based foods.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Nitrate and nitrite are approved food additives in some animal-based food products. However, nitrate and nitrite in foods are strictly regulated due to health concerns over methaemoglobinaemia and the potential formation of carcinogenic nitrosamines. In contrast, plants (like leafy vegetables) naturally accumulate nitrate ions; a growing body of research reveals beneficial metabolic effects of nitrate via its endogenous conversion to nitric oxide. To refine the association of dietary nitrate and nitrite intake with health outcomes, reliable measures of nitrate and nitrite intake from dietary food records are required. While a vegetable nitrate content database has been developed, there is a need for a comprehensive up-to-date nitrate and nitrite content database of animal-based foods. Methods and Results. A systematic literature search (1980-September 2020) on the nitrate and nitrite content of animal-based foods is carried out. Nitrate and nitrite concentration data and other relevant information are extracted and compiled into a database. The database contains 1921 entries for nitrate and 2077 for nitrite, extracted from 193 publications. The highest median nitrate content is observed in chorizo (median [IQR]; 101.61 [60.05-105.93] mg kg-1). Canned fish products have the highest median nitrite level (median [IQR]; 20.32 [6.16-30.16] mg kg-1). By subgroup, the median nitrate value in industrial processed meat products (e.g., uncured burger, patties and sausages), whole milk powder and in particular red meat are higher than cured meat products. Processed meat products from high-income regions have lower median nitrate and nitrite content than those of middle-income regions. Conclusion. This database can now be used to investigate the associations between nitrate and nitrite dietary intake and health outcomes in clinical trials and observational studies. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Zhong Wu; Wenzhi Zeng; Xun Zhang; Jiangfan Yang							Characterization of acidic tea polysaccharides from yellow leaves of wuyi rock tea and their hypoglycemic activity via intestinal flora regulation in rats.		Foods					A bioactive acidic tea polysaccharide from yellow leaves of Wuyi rock tea was successively prepared via DEAE-52 and Superdex-200 columns. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis showed that the main glycosidic bonds were composed of alpha-l-Araf-(1, 5)-alpha-l-Araf-(1, 4)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1, Arap-(1, 6)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1, 2,4)-alpha-l-Rhap-(1, 3,4)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1, 4)-alpha-d-GalAp-(1, 4)-alpha-d-GalAp-(1, alpha-d-Galp-(1, 6)-beta-d-Galp-(1 and 4)-beta-d-Galp-(1. The molecular weight was 3.9285 * 104 Da. The hypoglycemic effect of acidic tea polysaccharides on streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus rats was evaluated through histopathology and biochemistry analysis. The acidic tea polysaccharide could improve plasma and liver lipid metabolism. Moreover, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the composition of the intestinal flora changed drastically after treatment, namely, blooms of Bifidobacterium, Blautia, Dorea, and Oscillospira, and a strong reduction in Desulfovibrio and Lactobacillus. The above results illustrated that tea polysaccharides might serve as an effective ingredient to ameliorate glucose metabolism disorders and intestinal flora in hyperglycemic rats. © 2022 by the authors.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. This study aims to investigate and compare the potentially neuroprotective effects and underlying mechanisms for brown seaweed polysaccharides (PS) of Alginate (Alg) and its two components, including polymannuronic acid (PM) and polyguluronic acid (PG), against Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. Methods and Results. Model mice of PD are pretreated with Alg or PM or PG, separately via oral gavage once per day for four weeks. Our results found PM improved motor functions of PD mice, but Alg or PG did not. PM or PG, but not Alg, can prevent dopaminergic neuronal loss by increasing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expressions in midbrain of PD mice. The neuroprotective effects of PM rely on its anti-inflammation effects and its ability to improve striatal neurotransmitters (serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid (5-HIAA)) levels in PD mice. PM inhibits inflammation, but PG or Alg induces inflammation in systemic circulation of PD mice. The neuroprotection provided by PG might be related to its ability to increase striatal neurotransmitter of 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid levels in PD mice. Conclusion. PM plays better than PG to provide neuroprotection, but Alg did not show any neuroprotection against PD. Alg and its two components acted differently in preventing dopaminergic neuronal loss in PD mice. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	2			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100739					FSTA:2022-05-Aj7778

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are typical endocrine disruptors which are ubiquitous contaminants. Human exposure to PAEs is through multiple routes of which the diet is recognised as the main source of daily intake. The aim of this study was to evaluate the dietary exposure to PAEs of residents in Shenzhen (China) through a total diet study and assess the potential health risk. A total of 16 different phthalate esters in samples of 12 composite food groups were determined by GC-MS. The main dietary sources of PAE exposure among adult residents in Shenzhen were potatoes (21%), eggs (21%), meat (15%) and aquatic products (14%). The median total dietary exposure to PAEs in Shenzhen residents was 7780ng kg-1 bw d-1, and the hazard quotients (HQ) of dimethyl phthalate (DMP), diethyl phthalate (DEP), di-isobutyl phthalate (DIBP), dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) were 0.09, 0.06, 0.07, 0.10 and 0.03, respectively. Therefore, the risks from dietary PAE exposure were low. However, with the increasing use of PAEs and their accumulation in the environment, the probability of PAEs entering the food chain is gradually increasing and, therefore, PAEs should be strictly controlled and regularly monitored. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	9	1591	1603	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2022.2094474					FSTA:2022-12-Cf4193

Food & Function					Our previous study confirmed the beneficial effects of chestnut polysaccharides (CPs) on the spermatogenesis process, but the exact mechanism is not clear. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of balanced gut microbiota in maintaining normal reproductive function. In this study, we investigated the biological functions of CPs from the perspective of gut microbiota function, expecting to find out the specific mechanism of CPs in restoring impaired spermatogenesis. Compared with the control group, the mice treated with busulfan showed a reduced number of germ cells, structural changes in the small intestine and composition alteration in the gut microbiota at several levels, including the phylum and genus. In contrast, the number of germ cells in seminiferous tubules was significantly increased, and the structure of the small intestine and the composition of the gut microbiota were altered in the busulfan-treated mice after the CPs treatment. The 16s rRNA analysis results showed that the Firmicutes was the predominant phylum in all groups followed by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Tenericutes, Cyanobacteria and unidentified bacteria. Interestingly, the subsequent functional analysis implied that the steroid hormone biosynthesis process is the major metabolic pathway in the CPs-mediated restoration process and the experimental results confirmed this speculation. In conclusion, this study confirmed that CPs can restore the impaired spermatogenesis process by adjusting the gut microbiota and intestinal structure, which will also provide technical support and a theoretical basis for the subsequent treatment of male infertility. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	1	425	436	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03145g					FSTA:2022-04-Js5037

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					60Co gamma-ray irradiation-induced antigenicity changes in ovalbumin (OVA) were investigated, and the molecular mechanism was analyzed. Irradiation treatment at 0-100 kGy could significantly enhance the IgG/IgE binding ability of OVA in a dose-dependent paradigm by concomitant oxidative modification, which exhibited color browning and an increase in carbonyl content caused by high-penetrable rays. More allergenic epitopes of OVA were exposed after irradiation treatment reflected by structural changes including the unfolding of tertiary structure, the conversion of alpha-helix structures to beta-sheet and random coil structures, and the cleavage of several peptide bonds. Meanwhile, three oxidation sites of K46, T49, and N260 located in key linear epitopes were observed, which might increase the allergenic ability of OVA via the disaggregation of noncovalent bonds and the unwinding of alpha-helix structures. Conclusively, irradiation may enhance the potential allergenicity of OVA by oxidative modification, which provides theoretical guidance for effectively controlling the oxidation of proteins in the irradiation process.										2022	70	30	9477	9488	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03911					FSTA:2022-12-Qa0687

European Food Research and Technology					Cornus officinalis fruits, an edible functional food with the tonic effect, belongs to the Cornaceae family. It is widely used in both traditional medicine and in some food production. A phytochemical study on the fruits of Cornus officinalis resulted in 20 structurally diverse compounds including 2 new lignans, named officinalignans A-B (1-2), and 2 new iridoids, named loganin-(4′-O-7)-alpha-morroniside (3) and 2′-O-p-coumaroyl-kingiside (4). These structures were identified by various spectroscopic techniques and chemical methods, including NMR, high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), CD spectra and acid hydrolysis. The radical scavenging effects of all isolates were investigated. Compounds 1, 4, 15 and 18 showed significant inhibitory activities against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), whereas 7 and 17 displayed good 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) free radical-scavenging activities that was even more potent than that of trolox. In addition, all isolates were evaluated for their anti-inflammatory activities by detecting the nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in macrophages cell line RAW264.7, and compounds 3-4 and 6-7 exhibited the potent inhibition. The results disclosed that the lignans and iridoids from C. officinalis fruits can be regarded as a potential new source of antioxidants and inflammation inhibitors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Heat stress is one of the most important factors limiting the milk yields of dairy animals. This decline can be attributed to the heat-stress-induced apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells (MECs). The cytosolic arginine sensor for mTORC1 subunit 1 (CASTOR1) is a crucial upstream regulator of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, which has close connections with apoptosis. However, the specific roles of CASTOR1 in regulating the apoptosis and lactation of MECs are still obscure. In the present study, we found that heat stress promotes apoptosis and CASTOR1's expression in HC11 cells. Downregulation of CASTOR1 inhibits heat-stress-induced apoptosis through a ROS-independent pathway. In addition, silencing of CASTOR1 promotes cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and milk component synthesis, and overexpressing of CASTOR1 reverses these observations. Furthermore, we found that silencing of CASTOR1 contributes to the nuclear transport of SREBP1 and promotes lipid synthesis. This study demonstrates the pivotal roles of CASTOR1 in heat-stress-induced apoptosis and milk component synthesis in MECs.										2022	70	17	5386	5395	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00877					FSTA:2022-08-Pe3825

Food Chemistry					Nepsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and Nepsilon-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) have been the most extensively studied advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) in foods. Their formation mechanism, especially the latter, has not been clearly delineated in fermented food. In this work, the relative contents of CEL and CML were evaluated in a sourdough-bread and a silica solid chemical model. Lactic acid (LA) content in the sourdough increased with fermentation time that was accompanied by an increase in CEL, but not CML content in the bread. The role of LA as a precursor for CEL was supported by a positive significant correlation between LA and CEL contents, and further analysis using isotope-labeled LA (LA-13C3) revealed that the three carbon atoms of LA were incorporated into CEL. These findings for the first time indicate LA may function as a precursor to promote CEL formation in sourdough bread that merits further investigation.

Food & Function					Dietary interventions with probiotics have been widely reported to be effective in regulating obesity, and the intestinal microbiota is considered to be an important environmental factor. However, few reports focus on the interactions of microbiota-metabolites-phenotypic variables in ob/ob mice, and they have not been characterized in great detail. In this study, we investigated the effects of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 on obesity, the intestinal microbiota and the bile acid metabolism of ob/ob mice using biochemical testing, histochemical staining, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, LC-MS/MS analysis and qRT-PCR. The results showed that SC06 ameliorated the fat mass percentage, hepatic steatosis and liver lipid metabolism disorders and reshaped the gut microbiota and metabolites in male ob/ob mice, specifically deceasing f_S24-7, p_TM7, s_Alistipes massiliensis, f_Rikenellaceae, f_Prevotellaceae, f_Lactobacillaceae, g_Alistipes, g_Flexispira, g_Lactobacillus, g_Odoribacter, g_AF12 and g_Prevotella and increasing f_Bacteroidaceae, g_Bacteroidesand f_Desulfovibrionaceae.Meanwhile, SC06 treatment groups had lower ibuprofen and higher glycodeoxycholic acid and 7-dehydrocholesterol. Correlation analysis further clarified the relationships between compositional changes in the microbiota and alterations in the metabolites and phenotypes of ob/ob mice. Moreover, SC06 downregulated bile acid synthesis, export and re-absorption in the liver and increased ileum re-absorption into the blood in ob/ob mice, which may be mediated by the FXR-SHP/FGF15 signaling pathway. These results suggest that Bacillus amyloliquefaciens SC06 can ameliorate obesity in male ob/ob mice by reshaping the intestinal microbial composition, changing metabolites and regulating bile acid metabolism via the FXR signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	9	5381	5395	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03170h					FSTA:2022-08-Ad15236

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					To promote the industrial production of Chinese rice wine made by enzymatic extrudates, the first is to ensure the consistency of the raw material. That is, an evaluation standard of enzymatic extrudate should be set up. It was studied for the first time. By studying the changes of seven indexes of samples at different sites of extruder barrel and the die along the extrusion direction and making the correlation analysis to select the representative indexes. The results showed that the change trends of dextrose equivalent (DE), molecular weight distribution (MWD) and oligosaccharide composition (OC) were the same, and these indexes were more affected by mechanical force than by temperature. The ability of degradation of different zones was: conveying area < kneading area << exit of the die. There was little difference in extent of gelatinisation (GE) at the temperature where the enzyme activity was relatively high. Different from DE value, water solubility index (WSI) rose gradually. Surprisingly, DE was negatively correlated with GE, and positively correlated with oligosaccharides except DP1 and DP6, and had no significant correlation with water absorption index (WAI) and WSI. In conclusion, DE, WSI, DPD (especially DP6) could be used as a comprehensive evaluation index of enzymatic extrudates. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	8	4705	4715	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15412					FSTA:2022-11-Hc10119

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In view that enzymatic extrusion can change the degradation degree of raw materials, this paper studied the regulation rules of four indexes of degradation degree of enzymatically extruded glutinous rice flour and the correlation between these indexes and the quality indexes of brewed Chinese rice wine. The results showed that at appropriate water content, dextrose equivalent (DE) and water solubility index (WSI) were linearly related to the enzyme content in extrusion with thermostable alpha-amylase (TS-alphaA) and mesophilic alpha-amylase (MS-alphaA), respectively. But water absorption index (WAI) was not significantly affected by enzyme content. The percentages of each degree of polymerisation (DP) (1-7) and that of the sum of the rest DPs called other DP were the fundamental reasons for different DE values, WSI, WAI and quality indexes of Chinese rice wine. DP1 was significantly positively correlated with alcohol degree, and negatively correlated with total acid. DP2-DP7 (except DP4) was significantly positively correlated with amino acid nitrogen. Besides, other DP was significantly positively correlated with total sugar and total acid. The percentages of DP1, DP2-DP7 and other DP could be respectively adjusted by changing enzyme content in extrusion with MS-alphaA, MS-alphaA/TS-alphaA and TS-alphaA to control the related quality indexes of Chinese rice wine. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	8	4792	4803	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15660					FSTA:2022-11-Hc10116

Journal of Cereal Science					To help to control the qualities of Chinese rice wine brewed by enzymatically extruded glutinous rice, the correlation between the degradation degrees of extrudates and the qualities of Chinese rice wine were fully studied. Dextrose equivalent (DE), extent of gelatinization (GE), water solubility/absorption index (WSI/WAI), degree of polymerization (DP) distribution and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of glutinous rice extruded respectively with 0.5 Per mille, 1.0 Per mille, 1.5 Per mille and 2.0 Per mille thermostable alpha-amylase (TS-alphaA)/mesophilic alpha-amylase (MS-alphaA) were determined. Surprisingly, more TS-alphaA decreased DE value while more MS-alphaA increased DE value. Both alpha-amylases reduced WSI with more enzymes. Besides, more TS-alphaA promoted GE while more MS-alphaA decreased GE. The contents of DP1, DP3, DP5, DP6, DP7 and other DP fundamentally affected the qualities of Chinese rice wine. DP1 content was significantly negatively correlated with total sugar and amino acid nitrogen, and positively correlated with alcohol degree. The contents of DP3, DP5 and DP6 were significantly positively correlated with amino acid nitrogen, and negatively correlated with alcohol degree. The contents of DP7 and other DP had a very positive correlation with total sugar. It's expected to control the qualities of Chinese rice wine by adjusting the relevant DP's contents.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Serofluid dish is a popular fermented food in northwest China that contains abundant microorganisms. Advances of next-generation sequencing facilitate the elucidation of bacterial community composition, yet roles of fungi in serofluid dish need further exploration. Here, internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequencing and metatranscriptomics were conducted and results showed that the dominant fungal communities belong to Candida and Saccharomyces. Additionally, fungal diversity, including phylogenetic diversity and species richness, was largely correlated with pH, the total organic carbon (TOC) and spatial distance. Multivariate regression tree and all-subsets regression analysis also identified them as strong predictors. Further gene annotations revealed that fungi exhibited higher participation in the carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, translation and energy metabolism pathways, including sucrose and maltose metabolism and the production of acetate, fumarate and ethanol. Collectively, fungi in serofluid dish possess rich species diversity, and are affected by both environmental variation and geographical distance. In the fermentation process, fungi predominantly participated in the carbohydrate metabolism and genetic information processing.

A systemic study on the effect of egg white protein and isomalto-oligosaccharide mixture on the functional and gelation properties of Culter alburnus myofibrillar protein during long-term frozen storage.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The protective effects of egg white protein (EWP) and isomalto-oligosaccharide (IMO) mixture (EWP/IMO, 1:1, m/m) on Culter alburnus myofibrillar proteins (Mfp) during long-term frozen storage were systemically evaluated by comparing Mfp samples treated with EWP/IMO, IMO or EWP alone, using sample without any of them as blank control. After long-term frozen storage, 1% IMO and 1% EWP/IMO were more effective than 1% EWP in reducing oxidative denaturation-induced changes in functional groups and conformational sites of Mfp. Additionally, after frozen storage for 60days, Mfp emulsion activity index (EAI) and emulsion stability index (ESI) were significantly (P<0.05) higher in 1% IMO (20.68m2 g-1 vs. 56.54%) and 1% EWP/IMO (18.47m2 g-1 vs. 53.09%) than in 1% EWP (16.73m2 g-1 vs. 45.98%) and blank control (15.16m2 g-1 vs. 40.13%). Furthermore, Mfp gel strength was significantly (P<0.05) higher in 1% EWP/IMO (7.14gcm-1) than in IMO (6.33gcm-1), EWP (5.34gcm-1) and blank control (4.58gcm-1). Moreover, rheological test and LF-NMR results showed that adding EWP/IMO could more effectively improve Mfp gel viscoelasticity and three-dimensional gel network than adding EWP or IMO alone. This study provides a new theoretical perspective for applying EWP/IMO as a potential low-temperature protective agent in protein-based gel products . © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	12	7816	7828	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16111					FSTA:2023-03-Rc1360

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A new colorimetric and fluorescent turn-on probe named 2,4-bis (camphor-3-methylene) phenylacrylate (BCP-Cys) was designed for highly sensitive and specific monitoring of cysteine (Cys). The probe BCP-Cys was strategically constructed by employing a new bis-camphor-derived scaffold (BCP-OH) as the fluorophore and an acrylate group as the recognition site and fluorescence quencher. The acrylate group of BCP-Cys could be exclusively cleaved by Cys and release the fluorophore BCP-OH, thereby causing a significantly enhanced red fluorescence and a naked-eye colorimetric change from colorless to yellow. The probe BCP-Cys exhibited promising sensing performances for Cys including large Stokes shift (184 nm), fast response time (<1 min), wide linear range (0-100 nM), and low detection limit (0.0728 muM). Moreover, the probe BCP-Cys could be utilized as a powerful tool for real-time determination of Cys levels within different food samples, such as onion, cabbage, broccoli, garlic, cauliflower, and bamboo sprout. In addition, this probe was also capable of imaging endogenous and exogenous Cys in living cells.										2022	70	2	669	679	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06294					FSTA:2022-05-Jq6547

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Estrone-3-sulfate (E3S) uptake mediated by organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B3 (OATP1B3) can be activated by epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG). In this study, by using chimeric transporters and site-directed mutagenesis, we found that Val386 in transmembrane domain 8 (TM8) is essential for OATP1B3's activation by EGCG. Kinetic studies showed that the loss of activation of 1B3-TM8 and 1B3-V386F in the presence of EGCG is due to their decreased substrate binding affinity and reduced maximal transport rate. The overall transport efficiencies of OATP1B3, 1B3-TM8, and 1B3-V386F in the absence and presence of EGCG are 8.6 0.7 vs 15.9 1.4 (p< 0.05), 11.2 2.1 vs 2.7 0.3 (p< 0.05), and 10.2 1.0 vs 2.5 0.3 (p< 0.05), respectively. While 1B3-V386F cannot be activated by EGCG, its transport activity for EGCG is also diminished. OATP1B3's activation by EGCG is substrate-dependent as EGCG inhibits OATP1B3-mediated pravastatin uptake. Furthermore, the activation of OATP1B3-mediated E3S uptake by quercetin 3-O-alpha-l-arabinopyranosyl (1 2)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside is not affected by TM8 and V386F. Taken together, the activation of OATP1B3 by small molecules is substrate-and modulator-dependent, and V386 in TM8 plays a critical role in the activation of OATP1B3-mediated E3S uptake by EGCG.										2022	70	21	6552	6560	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02692					FSTA:2022-10-Aj18597

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The fruits of Garcinia oblongifolia Champ. ex Benth. were famous as an edible fruit in tropical regions of China. Because of its unique taste and great nutritional value, the ripe fresh fruits of G. oblongifolia could be eaten directly or used as raw materials for natural beverages and food supplements. In this work, six new polyprenylated benzophenones (1-6) and one new dimeric tocotrienol derivative (7), together with 18 known ones (8-25), were isolated from the fruits of G. oblongifolia. Compounds 1-4 were peculiar polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs) featuring the rare carbon skeleton of a bicyclo [3.4.1] decane-1,3-diketone. Moreover, all isolates (1-25) were evaluated for their cytotoxicity activities against nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines (CNE1 and CNE2). Among these isolates, compound 6 exhibited the strongest cytotoxicity activity on CNE1 and CNE2 cells with the IC50 values of 7.8 0.2 and 9.1 0.3muM, respectively. Further mechanistic investigation demonstrated that 6 could induce mitophagy to promote Caspase-9/GSDME-mediated pyroptosis through triggering ROS in NPC cells.										2022	70	34	10506	10520	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04216					FSTA:2023-01-Jg0200

Food Chemistry					Processing stages play critical role in the nutrition and flavor changes of marine products. This study investigated the nutrition and flavor profiles in noble scallop Chlamys nobilis adductor during boiling, rinsing, baking and drying processing stages by high performance liquid chromatography, headspace solid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The results showed that the overall processing stages favorably preserved the essential amino acids. Drying obviously increased the umami and sweet amino acids contents by 72.08%, 67.77%, respectively (P < 0.05), and promoted the production of flavor nucleotides. In addition, the overall processing stages significantly increased the protein and lipid oxidation degree by (1.49-3.01)-fold and (4.25-5.81)-fold, respectively, compared with raw group (P < 0.05). Moreover, alcohols were the major volatiles in raw group, while the aldehydes, alcohols, and hydrocarbons predominated in rinsing, baking and drying stages. In conclusion, the processing maintained the nutrition value and improved the flavor of scallop adductors.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					A novel natural zinc-enriched polysaccharide: OZPs-1 was isolated from oyster (Crassostrea hongkongensis), with 922.18mugg-1 of zinc. The physicochemical properties and structural features of OZPs-1 were systematically studied. The results showed OZPs-1 was predominantly composed of glucose, with a molecular weight ranging from 4 to 2044kDa. OZPs-1 showed favourable thermal stability. NMR analysis showed that there was no sulphate substitution and C-6 substitution in OZPs-1, while C-4might be the binding site of zinc and polysaccharide. UV, FTIR and XRD spectra suggested-OH and-COOH group might be involved in the binding of zinc to polysaccharides in OZPs-1 and there were no ZnO and sulphate substitutions in OZPs-1. These conclusions indicated that zinc might bind with-OH and-COOH in C-4 of polysaccharides and impart the stable structure and favourable physicochemical properties of OZPs-1, which could facilitate the application of OZPs-1 as natural organic zinc supplements. © 2022 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2022	57	12	7872	7884	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.16139					FSTA:2023-03-Re1367

Food Chemistry					The active peptides in Qingke baijiu fermented from Qingke (highland barley) are rarely reported. This work was designed to accurately identify peptides in Qingke baijiu and evaluate their angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory activities in vitro. Four novel peptides, Val-Val-Thr-Gly-Val-Gly-Gly-Gln (VVTGVGGQ), Leu-Pro-Val-Gly-Pro (LPVGP), Leu-Leu-Ser-Pro-Pro (LLSPP), and Phe-Pro-Leu-Gln-Pro-His-Gln-Pro (FPLQPHQP) were identified by Nano-UPLC-MS/MS. Molecular docking showed that LPVGP and FPLQPHQP had a high affinity with ACE (binding energy -8.78, -10.02 kcal mol-1), which matched its in vitro ACE inhibitory activity (IC50 9.05, 5.03 M). This might be related to their high hydrophobicity. Moreover, three peptides have C-terminal proline, which may contribute to their anti-digestive activity. The content of LPVGP was over 91.23% after digestion, while the content of VVTGVGGQ dropped to 55.47%. Finally, the four peptides have no obvious toxicity to Caco-2 cells. This study clarifies the ACE inhibitory activity and the structure-activity relationship of the four peptides identified in Qingke baijiu.

J		Zhongwei Chen; Jiajuan Shen; Yuying Yang; Huijun Wang; Bin Xu							Intact aleurone cells limit the hydrolysis of endogenous lipids in wheat bran during storage.		Food Research International					This work aimed to elucidate the effect of aleurone cell integrity on the hydrolysis of endogenous lipids in wheat bran and flour. The distribution of lipases in the bran dissected layers (aleurone layer, outer pericarp and intermediate layer) and the lipid hydrolysis in the bran fractions and flour containing the aleurone cells with different integrity were investigated. The results indicated that 80% of the lipase activities in bran layers were associated with the aleurone layer. After centrifugal impact milling, the aleurone layer in commercial bran could be detached into the monolayer cell clusters with decreasing integrities as the particle size decreased. In the oil phase, intact aleurone cells did not limit the lipase activities in the bran fractions because the oil could penetrate into aleurone cells. During storage, the hydrolysis rates of endogenous lipids in the bran fractions and their mixed flour increased as the integrity of aleurone cells decreased; while after the aleurone cells were broken, the hydrolysis rates of endogenous lipids increased to be in line with the lipase activities in bran fractions, indicating the limitation of intact aleurone cells on lipid hydrolysis. These results gave a new understanding of the effect of aleurone cell structure on the interaction between lipases and lipids in wheat bran, and will facilitate the production of stable wheat bran and whole wheat flour.

Food & Function					In this study, the extraction, purification, physical and chemical properties, and biological activity of the Pholiota adiposa (PAP) polysaccharide were investigated. One fraction (PAP-1a) of Pholiota adiposa polysaccharides was isolated using DEAE Sepharose Fast Flow and Sephacryl S-300 High-Resolution columns. The HPLGPC results revealed that the molecular weight of PAP-1a was 16.453 kDa. PAP-1a was composed of mannose, ribose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose, arabinose, and fucose and their molar % was 33.41, 0.53, 1.33, 0.07, 0.27, 5.28, 38.31, 0.83, 18.04 and 2.23, respectively. PAP-1a could activate macrophages to secrete NO and cytokines such as TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-12p70. When hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HCCs) and macrophages were co-cultured, it was observed that PAP-1a inhibited the growth of Hep-G2, Hep-3B, and Huh7 via immunoregulation. It triggered cell apoptosis by blocking the cell cycle in the G0/G1 stage. Furthermore, PAP-1a had no direct cytotoxicity against the hepatocyte cell line L02 and macrophages RAW264.7. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	9	5153	5165	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03628a					FSTA:2022-08-Jq11643

Food & Function					Neurotransmitters in the brain are important for cognition and memory. As bioactive substrates, whether increased soy protein levels in pigs can promote hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis remains unclear. The effect of increased soy protein hydrolysate (SPH) levels in the small intestine of pigs on neurotransmitter precursor supply, hypothalamic neurotransmitter synthesis and underlying molecular processes was investigated by using sixteen pigs (35.2 0.3kg) infused either with SPH (70g day-1) or sterile saline (control) twice daily for 15 days via a duodenal fistula. It demonstrated that SPH infusion increased the expression of the neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 in the jejunal mucosa, the serum tyrosine/large neutral amino acid ratio, the concentrations of serum tyrosine, hypothalamic tyrosine, dopamine and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (P< 0.05). It also increased the jejunal and serum choline, hypothalamic choline and acetylcholine levels (P< 0.05). Hypothalamic transcriptome revealed that differential genes were significantly enriched in the cholinergic synapse, dopaminergic synapse and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signalling pathways, and that the expression of key enzyme genes in the synthesis of acetylcholine and dopamine and dopamine receptors 1 (DRD1) was upregulated by SPH (P< 0.05). Western blotting showed that SPH infusion activated the hypothalamic cAMP signalling pathways. Overall, SPH infusion promoted the synthesis of hypothalamic dopamine and acetylcholine, and the synthesised dopamine promoted BDNF production most likely through the activation of the cAMP signalling pathways by the DRD1. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	23	12067	12076	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02314h					FSTA:2023-03-Gg1081

Food Control					Moldy apple core is an internal fruit disease that poses a threat to consumer health. In this study, a synthetic minority over-sampling technology (SMOTE) based model of moldy apple core was proposed to solve the problem of poor model performance due to imbalanced sample distribution in the spectral nondestructive detection of moldy apple core. Two different methods, random under-sampling (RUS) and SMOTE, were used to balance the original samples. A hybrid strategy of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and successive projections algorithm (SPA) was used for spectral variable selection, and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) classification model and least squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM) nonlinear classification model were constructed. The SMOTE-based method was better than the RUS method in solving the problem of imbalanced sample distribution. The constructed SMOTE-CARS-SPA-LS-SVM model could not only accurately identify the healthy and diseased apples with a disease degree of >10% but also improve the detection accuracy of slightly moldy apple core. In addition, the method has certain practical applicability in external verification.

Food & Function					As the demand of consumers for good meat quality is increasing, there is more interest in improving pork quality by nutritional regulation. Dihydromyricetin (DHM), a group of bioactive flavonoids, exhibits excellent biological functions and pharmacological activities. This study aimed to investigate whether dietary DHM supplementation in growing-finishing pigs could provide high-quality pork. A total of 24 healthy castrated Duroc*Landrace*Yorkshire (DLY) pigs with an average body weight of 26.950.26 kg were randomly divided into four groups (basal diet and a basal diet supplemented with 100, 300 and 500 mg kg-1 DHM) with 6 duplicates and one pig per replicate. The growth performance, carcass traits and pork quality of growing-finishing pigs were detected. Then, tandem mass tag (TMT) based quantitative proteomics, western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) were used to explore the regulatory mechanism of DHM on pork quality. The results showed that DHM decreased the feed to gain ratio (F/G) and improved the sensory quality (shear force and meat color) and nutritional value (crude protein content and amino acid composition) of pork in growing-finishing pigs. Totally 22 differentially expressed proteins were identified, among which the down-regulated heat shock protein-beta1 (HSPB1) and up-regulated Troponin C-slow (TNNC1) contributed towards explaining the positive effect of DHM on the tenderness and meat color of pork. GO enrichment analysis revealed that better meat color was also linked to higher levels of oxidative metabolism and hemoglobin complexes in pork. Western blotting and RT-qPCR analysis showed that DHM induced a muscle fiber type transformation from fast-switch to slow-switch by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signal, thereby improving the pork quality. Taken together, our findings provide effective evidence for the application of DHM in high-quality pork production. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	6	3649	3659	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03391c					FSTA:2022-07-Sj3432

Food & Function					Dihydromyricetin (DHM) has attracted wide concern for its excellent biological function and pharmacological activities and was reported to have a positive effect on skeletal muscle insulin resistance, slow-twitch fibers expression and AMPK signaling. Thus, we took porcine myotubes derived from skeletal muscle satellite cells as the object to investigate the effects of DHM on myosin heavy chain (MyHC) expression and its mechanism in this study. Data showed that DHM up-regulated protein expression of MyHC I and down-regulated the protein expression of MyHC IIb, accompanied by an increase of MyHC I mRNA level and a decrease of MyHC IIb mRNA level. Besides, DHM increased the activities of malate dehydrogenase and succinic dehydrogenase and reduced lactate dehydrogenase activity. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) was phosphorylated and AMPKalpha1 mRNA level was increased by DHM. The AMPK signaling-related factors including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha), sirtuin1 (Sirt1), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF1), and phospho-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta (p-CaMKKbeta) were increased by DHM. Inhibition of the AMPK signaling by compound C and AMPKalpha1 siRNA significantly attenuated the effects of DHM on expressions of MyHC I, MyHC IIb, PGC-1alpha and Sirt1. As a whole, DHM increased MyHC I expression and decreased MyHC IIb expression by the AMPK signaling. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	20	10525	10534	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02173k					FSTA:2023-02-Sj1014

Food Chemistry					This study aimed to explore the characteristics of Pickering emulsions stabilized by tea water-insoluble protein nanoparticles (TWIPNs) at different pH values. The characteristics of TWIPNs at different pH values were analysed first. The average hydrodynamic diameter of TWIPNs in the suspension was smaller than 400 nm at pH 7-11. TWIPNs at pH 3 could not be used to stabilize Pickering emulsions. The flocculation index (FI) of fresh TWIPN-stabilized Pickering emulsions (TWIPNPEs) at pH 5 was higher than those of TWIPNPEs at pH 7-11 (FI < 5%), indicating that bridging flocculation led to the aggregation of small emulsion droplets. The zeta potential of TWIPNPEs at pH 7-11 did not change after 7 d. In addition, the TWIPNPEs showed gel-like properties under neutral and alkaline conditions. These results will be helpful for broadening the application of TWIPNPEs at different pH values.

Food Research International					Myofibrillar proteins (MPs) are susceptibly affected by ionic strength. The effect of ionic strength on the structure and emulsifying properties of MPs from hairtail (Trichiurus haumela) is still unclear. Therefore, the effect of ionic strength on the structural properties and emulsification of myofibrillar proteins from hairtail was analyzed. The increase in ionic strength led to the increase in endogenous fluorescence intensity of MPs. The alpha-helix content in MPs first increased and then decreased from ionic strength of 0 to 1.0 mol/L and beta-sheet content exhibited the oppositive trend, indicating that alpha-helix in MP transformed into beta-sheet. The surface hydrophobic groups of MPs increased; however, the contact angle decreased with the increase in ionic strength of 0-0.8 mol/L and a slight rebound at 1.0mol/L. Sulfhydryl content and electrophoretic analysis further exhibited the change of MP structure at ionic strengths of 0-1.0 mol/L. Besides, the droplet size of MP emulsions was small and evenly distributed at 0.6 mol/L. Additionally, the creaming index of MP emulsions had better stability prepared at 0.6 mol/L than the other ionic strength conditions. The apparent viscosity of MP emulsions increased with the increase in ionic strength of 0-0.8 mol/L and decreased slightly at 1.0 mol/L. The rheological behavior of MP emulsions exhibited gel-like behavior without the effect of temperatures at 20-80 °C. These results can broaden the potential application of MPs from hairtail on the emulsion-type seafood products and delivery system in the food industry.

J		Zhongyu Li; Yidi Ma; Shanshan Huo; Yalei Ke; Ai Zhao							Impact of COVID-19 vaccination status and confidence on dietary practices among chinese residents.		Foods					Healthy diets promote immune functions and have been shown to reduce COVID-19 severity. In 2021, COVID-19 vaccines have become available to the general public. However, whether vaccination status could affect individual and populational health behaviors is unknown. This study aimed to investigate the impacts of vaccination status and confidence on dietary practices. An online survey was conducted in August 2021. We collected data on dietary intake, diversity and behaviors, vaccination status and confidence and socio-demographic characteristics. Among the 5107 responses received, a total of 4873 study participants were included in the final analysis. Most of our participants aged between 18 and 45 years and 82% of them were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Household level dietary diversity was found to be higher among people who were fully vaccinated (beta = 0.321, 95%CI: 0.024 to 0.618) or who were more confident in the protectiveness of the vaccine (beta for tertile 3 comparing with lowest tertile = 0.544, 95%CI: 0.407, 0.682). Vaccination promoted the intake of seafood, but it was also positively associated with the consumption of sugar, preserved, fried and barbequed foods and reduced vegetable intake. Higher vaccination confidence was associated with increased consumption of seafood, bean, fruits and vegetables and reduced fat intake. Changes in dietary behaviors compared with early 2021 (when vaccination was not common) were observed and differed by vaccination status and confidence level. Conclusion. COVID-19 vaccination status and confidence had varied, and possibly negative, impacts on dietary intake and behaviors. Our results suggest that vaccination status and confidence might be significant influencing factors affecting people's health behaviors and highlight that healthy eating should be consistently promoted to prevent poor dietary practices during global health crisis. © 2022 by the authors.

Food & Function					Oral administration of combinations of specific nutrients and nutraceuticals can provide synergistic health benefits to humans. In this work, zein/carboxymethyl cellulose composite nanoparticles were successfully prepared using antisolvent precipitation methods. Zein/carboxymethyl cellulose nanoparticles with the smallest size (204.6 nm) were formed when the mass ratio of zein to CMC was 2:1. Hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions were dominant binding forces to stabilize the composite nanoparticles. Quercetin and resveratrol were then encapsulated within these nanocarriers, which improved their resistance to both light and thermal degradation. Encapsulation of the nutraceuticals was shown to delay their release under simulated gastrointestinal conditions, which may be beneficial for some applications.

J		Zhongyu Zuo; Xinxia Zhang; Ting Li; Jianjun Zhou; Yang Yang; Xiaobo Bian; Li Wang							High internal phase emulsions stabilized solely by sonicated quinoa protein isolate at various pH values and concentrations.		Food Chemistry					In this study, stable high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) constructed solely by sonicated quinoa protein isolate (QPI) at various pH values and protein concentrations (c) were constructed, and differences of HIPE microstructures at these conditions were discussed. HIPEs stabilized by QPI at pH 7.0, 9.0 possessed smaller droplet size (14-24 mum), smoother appearance, and higher physical stability which were caused by polyhedral framework microstructure. However, at acidic conditions, QPI aggregates filled in the gaps between droplets (30-52 mum) instead of adsorbing to oil-water interface, which decreased the stability. The solid-like viscoelasticity of HIPEs were enhanced when the c increased while the increment of pH value had the significant opposite effect (decreased from about G′ 1000 Pa, G 280 Pa to G′ 350 Pa, G 50 Pa) due to the microstructure difference. This study broadens the commercial applications of quinoa protein in novel food products like fat substitutes.

Foods					Salmonella Typhimurium is widely distributed in food. It can colonise the gastrointestinal tract after ingestion, causing lamina propria edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and mucosal epithelial decomposition. A high-fat diet (HFD) can induce an inflammatory response, but whether HFD can increase the infection level of S. Typhimurium is unknown. We established a model of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain ATCC 13311 ATCC 13311 infection in healthy adult mice with a maintenance diet (MD) or HFD to explore the effect of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum 1201 intervention on S. Typhimurium ATCC 13311 colonization and its protective effects on mice. HFD exacerbated the infection of S. Typhimurium ATCC 13311, while the intervention of L. plantarum 1201 effectively mitigated this process. L. plantarum 1201 can reduce the colonies of S. ATCC 13311 in the intestines and tissues; and reduce intestinal inflammation by down-regulating the level of TLR4/NF-kappaB pathway related proteins in serum and the expression of related inflammatory factors in the colon and jejunum. Since L. plantarum 1201 can inhibit the colonization of S. Typhimurium ATCC 13311 and relieve inflammation in HFD, current research may support the use of L. plantarum 1201 to prevent S. Typhimurium infection. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.										2022	11	1			2304-8158				10.3390/foods11010085					FSTA:2022-09-Ad16776

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, the ultrafine grinding (UG) and high pressure homogenization (HPH) treated slurry on the particle size and rheological property of slurry, texture, in vitro starch digestibility, and multiscale structure of steamed rice bread (SRB) were investigated. Then, it was found that the average particle size of slurry treated by UG and HPH reduced from 84.6 to 38.6mum and 22.6mum, respectively. The rheological properties results demonstrated that G′ resulted in higher values than G, and that the values of G′, G and tan delta of slurry decreased obviously after UG and HPH treatment. Obviously, the hardness and viscidity of SRB made by UG and HPH were lower, while the elasticity and specific volume were higher. The determination of in vitro starch digestibility revealed that UG treated on slurry accelerated the starch hydrolysis rate of SRB, resulting in an increase in the pGI from 76.17 to 79.36, while HPH treatment reduced the pGI from 76.17 to 73.49. Furthermore, XRD and FTIR demonstrated that both UG and HPH increased the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, and both treatments also assisted in starch arrangement for increasing the ordered crystallization of starch, which may contribute to the increasing amylose content. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	8	5216	5227	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15837					FSTA:2022-11-Mn6440
J		Zhongzhuan Yin; Yuanyong Tian; Yan Cai; Lin Qi; Chunhong Yuan; Junrong Liu; Tanye Xu							Mitochondrial activity as an indicator of scallop (Mizuhopecten yessoensis) adductor muscle in early cold storage.		Journal of Food Science					The purpose of this study was to reveal the role of mitochondria in indicating a change in the freshness of the adductor muscle of Mizuhopecten yessoensis during cold storage and hardening. The adductor muscle hardens after 96 h of cold storage and reaches the maximum degree of hardening in 6 h. In this study, after hardening (102 h), the muscle fiber structure obviously broke and curled, and the sarcomere structure disappeared at 150 h. After hardening (102 h), the morphology of the mitochondria changed, including swelling, cristea breaking and membrane structure disappearance. The arginine phosphate content decreased gradually from the initial 4.618 to 1.306 mol/g at 48 h, and there was no further obvious change. The ATP content decreased from 6.02 to 1.07 mol/g in 120 h. The mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltaphi) was measured by a fluorescence method (JC-1). The changes in freshness could be divided into three classes according to the Deltaphi difference between the mitochondria in the adductor muscle after adding ADP and CCCP. Mitochondrial function was complete from 0 to 6 h; mitochondrial function began to decline at 6 to 48 h; and mitochondrial function completely disappeared after 48 h. The results showed that the mitochondrial membrane potential compared with other indicators could more sensitively reflect the changes in freshness during the cold storage hardening process of the adductor muscle. Practical Application. It is very important to interprete the post-mortem energy metabolism for controlling the muscle quality of Yesso scallop. The K value which was developed based on ATP-related compounds is widely used in evaluating the freshness of seafood. Mitochondria is the main sites of cellular energy metabolism and the changes of its structure and activity can sensitively reflect the quality changes in muscle cell. It is expected to develop a more sensitive freshness evaluation index. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	1	206	215	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16007					FSTA:2022-05-Re1723
J		Zhou, B.; Drusch, S.; Hogan, S. A.							Rheological fingerprinting and tribological assessment of high internal phase emulsions stabilized by whey protein isolate: effects of protein concentration and pH.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of protein concentration and pH on the rheological and lubrication behavior of high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs), stabilized by whey protein isolate (WPI), were investigated by combining large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) and tribology characterizations. All HIPEs showed predominantly solid-like behavior with greater stiffness at higher protein concentration. Emulsions at lower protein concentrations experienced extensive intracycle shear thinning with increased energy dissipation, indicating less resistance to large deformations and ready alignment in the shear flow. Increasing pH from 3 to 7 resulted in greater fragility with easier yielding to nonlinear behavior and faster transition to Newtonian fluid dissipation. This is likely due to the greater interfacial elasticity of oil droplets at neutral pH. In addition, tribological testing showed that increasing protein concentration resulted in a transition to the hydrodynamic regime. Emulsions at pH 3 had better mixed lubrication than those at pH 7, which can be attributed to easier entrainment of more deformable oil droplets. The findings of this study provide insights into the design potential of HIPEs with tunable textural properties and better prediction of structural transformations during food processing.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Properties of short-chain antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) depend on their primary structures. Brevibacillus laterosporus was previously found to secrete five AMPs. Herein, we discovered exogenously-added L-valine could regulate this strain to produce novel AMPs (named as Brevilaterin V) with new primary structures. Five novel Brevilaterins V with linear peptides were purified and characterized. They had high antimicrobial activities against 10 tested pathogenic bacteria. Brevilaterins V exhibited a good stability even treatment at 100°C, or pH 2 or pH 12, for 2 h. Interestingly, all novel Brevilaterins V showed low hemolytic activities. In particular, the hemolytic rates of Brevilaterin V1 and Brevilaterin V2 were <5%; however, single changes in primary structure or a single extra methylene in the N-terminal fatty acid chain increase the hemolytic activity. The strategy of using amino acids in culture medium to regulate AMPs production by Br. laterosporus provides a basis for improvement of the range and properties of known AMPs.

J		Zhou Lu; Pin-Rou Lee; Hongshun Yang							Chickpea flour and soy protein isolate interacted with kappa-carrageenan via electrostatic interactions to form egg omelets analogue.		Food Hydrocolloids					In recent years, demand for the plant-based egg substitutes has increased significantly, especially in Singapore, a country seeking for innovative food sources imminently. In the current study, chickpea flour, soy protein isolate, shortening, baking powder, mono, diglyceride, transglutaminase, potassium chloride, flour, and hydrocolloids (kappa-carrageenan (kappa-C) or gellan gum (GG)) were used to develop the eggless omelets. A formulation comprising 0.3% kappa-C (0.3kappa-C) best matched the physiochemical properties of egg, in terms of hardness (4437 vs. 4614g), specific volume (1.24 vs. 1.19cm3/g), and gel strength (19.3 vs. 17.5 kPa). This could be attributed to the highest synergistic kappa-C-protein interactions in 0.3kappa-C, along with the most homogeneous gel structure observed under confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The addition of 0.1% kappa-C induced more kappa-C-protein interactions than the one without hydrocolloids, but such increase was not as dominant as 0.3kappa-C. When the kappa-C concentration reached 0.5%, however, the rheological synergism decreased while the electrostatic interactions increased; that signifies the increased kappa-C-kappa-C interactions. Contrastingly, a segregated GG-protein interaction occurred in all GG systems, as indicated from synergism and CLSM images. These differences in interactions and structures affected the macroscale properties of our plant-based egg products, explaining the different physiochemical properties among them. A schematic diagram was therefore proposed to build connections between physiochemical properties, interactions, and structure.

Effects of increasing air temperature on physiological and productive responses of dairy cows at different relative humidity and air velocity levels.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study determined the effects of increasing ambient temperature (T) at different relative humidity (RH) and air velocity (AV) levels on the physiological and productive responses of dairy cows. Twenty Holstein dairy cows were housed inside climate-controlled respiration chambers, in which the climate was programmed to follow a daily pattern of lower night and higher day T with a 9 °C difference, excluding effects from sun radiation. Within our 8-d data collection period, T was gradually increased from 7 to 21 °C during the night (12 h) and 16 to 30 °C during the day (12 h), with an incremental change of 2 °C per day for both nighttime and daytime T. During each research period, RH and AV were kept constant at 1 of 5 treatment levels. A diurnal pattern for RH was created, with lower levels during the day and higher levels during the night: low (RH_l: 30-50%), medium (RH_m: 45-70%), and high (RH_h: 60-90%). The effects of AV were studied during the day at 3 levels: no fan (AV_l: 0.1 m/s), fan at medium speed (AV_m: 1.0 m/s), and fan at high speed (AV_h: 1.5 m/s). Effects of short and long exposure time to increasing T were evaluated by collecting data 2 times a day: in the morning [short: 1 h (or less)-exposure time] and afternoon (long: 8 h-exposure time). The animals had free access to feed and water and both were ad libitum. Respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), skin temperature (ST), dry matter intake, water intake, milk yield, and composition were measured. The inflection point temperatures (IPt) at which a certain variable started to change were determined for the different RH and AV levels and different exposure times. Results. Showed that IPt under long exposure time for RR (first indicator) varied between 18.9 and 25.5 °C but was between 20.1 and 25.9 °C for RT (a delayed indicator). The IPt for both RR and RT decreased with higher RH levels, whereas IPt increased with higher AV for RR but gave a minor change for RT. The ST was positively correlated with ambient T and ST was not affected by RH but significantly affected by AV. For RR, all IPt was lower under long exposure time than under short exposure time. The combination of higher RH levels and low AV level negatively affected dry matter intake. Water intake increased under all treatments except RH_l-AV_l. Treatment RH_h-AV_l negatively affected milk protein and fat yield, whereas treatments RH_m-AV_m and RH_m-AV_h reduced milk fat yield. We concluded that RH and AV significantly affected the responses of RR, RT, ST, and productive performance of high-producing Holstein cows. These responses already occurred at moderate ambient T of 19 to 26 °C.

J		Zhou, P.; Lawrence, P.; Abbaspourad, A.; Dando, R.							Effects of LED exposure on the sensory properties of soybean oil.		Journal of Food Science					Soybean oil is an important commodity in the US and abroad. As lipids are vulnerable to oxidation, damage to soybean oil has been previously reported to arise from prolonged light exposure. Here, we assessed the extent of damage to samples of soybean oil from light, tested with sensory evaluation, assaying the effects of both LED and fluorescent lighting (both at 2000 lux) exposure to oil in PET bottles, using a variety of sensory approaches. Threshold testing (n = 66) suggested that differences in the sensory properties of soybean oil could be detected by a human panelist after only 32 h of LED exposure. Sensory flash profiling (n = 21) again confirmed that light-exposed samples were perceived differently to shielded samples, with LED-exposed samples clustering together, but separately from those instead exposed to fluorescent light. These differences did not necessarily result in a drop in liking of the samples, assessed with consumer testing (n = 94), despite a trend for lower liking in exposed versus shielded samples. With similar levels of light exposure, elevated dissolved oxygen levels could be mitigated with O2 scavenging. Our results suggest that soybean oil may be reaching the consumer at a differing quality than intended, which may be mitigated with superior packaging technologies. Practical Application. Soybean oil is used widely in the US and global food systems; however, it can be damaged via light oxidation. Here, we show that human panelists can readily detect the sensory signals from light damage in oil exposed for only short periods of time, via either fluorescent or LED light sources. The results suggest that superior soybean oil could be delivered to the market if improvements in packaging technologies were considered. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	9	4162	4173	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16286					FSTA:2023-01-Ne0167
J		Zhou Zhang; Na Wang; Xiaofei Liu; Jizhou Lv; Hongli Jing; Xiangfen Yuan; Dongjie Chen; Xiangmei Lin; Shaoqiang Wu							A novel, reverse transcription, droplet digital PCR assay for the combined, sensitive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 with swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread over the world since its emergence. Although the dominant route of SARS-CoV-2 infection is respiratory, a number of studies revealed infection risk from contaminated surfaces and products, including porcine-derived food and other products. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has been severely threatening public health, and disrupting porcine products trade and the pig industry. Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV), which was responsible for large-scale, fatal disease in piglets, emerged in 2017 and has caused enormous economic losses in the pig industry. Currently, reverse transcription real-time PCR (RT-rPCR) is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and is most commonly used for SADS-CoV detection. However, inaccurate detection of the SARS-CoV-2 infection obtained by RT-rPCR is increasingly reported, especially in specimens with low viral load. Objective This study aimed to develop an accurate reverse transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) assay for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and SADS-CoV simultaneously. Methods. Two pairs of primers and one double-quenched probe targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) region of the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) gene of SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding ORF1ab region of SADS-CoV were designed to develop the RT-ddPCR assay. The sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, and reproducibility were tested using complementary RNAs (cRNAs) and clinical specimens. Results. The detection limits of RT-ddPCR were 1.48 0.18 and 1.38 0.17 copies in a 20muL reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and SADS-CoV cRNAs, respectively (n = 8), showing approximately 4-and 10-fold greater sensitivity than the RT-rPCR assay. This assay also exhibited good specificity, repeatability, and reproducibility. Conclusion. The established RT-ddPCR assay was shown to be a highly effective, accurate, and reliable method for the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 and SADS-CoV. Highlights This RT-ddPCR assay could be used to detect both SARS-CoV-2 and SADS-CoV in a sample with one double-quenched probe, and is also the first reported RT-ddPCR assay for SADS-CoV detection. ©The Author(s) 2022.

J		Zhoujie Yang; Xiaoli Zhu; Anyan Wen; Likang Qin							Development of probiotics beverage using cereal enzymatic hydrolysate fermented with Limosilactobacillus reuteri.		Food Science & Nutrition					Although most probiotic products are milk based, lactose intolerance and vegetarianism inspired the idea of developing nondairy probiotic products. In this study, probiotic beverages were produced from four enzymatically hydrolyzed cereal substrates (coix seed, quinoa, millet, and brown rice) and fermented by Limosilactobacillus reuteri. Fermentation parameters, including pH, titratable acidity, viable count, organic acids, and volatile components were determined. Results showed that the pH values decreased and titratable acidity increased with the fermentation process (p< .05). Although the final pH in all samples was below 4.0, the growth of L. reuteri was not significantly inhibited by low pH. The number of viable bacteria (12.96 log CFU/ml) in coix seed substrate was significantly higher than that in other samples after the fermentation for 24 h (p< .05). Lactic acid and acetic acid were the main organic acids after fermentation and the highest in quinoa (lactic acid: 7.58 mg/ml; acetic acid: 2.23 mg/ml). The flavor analysis indicated that there were differences in the flavor components of different cereal beverages. Forty-nine volatile compounds were identified in four beverages, including acids, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, and esters. The results of the electronic tongue showed that the umami taste of the fermented coix seed was better than that of other samples, displaying the more pleasant taste characteristics. In conclusion, it is feasible to prepare probiotic symbiotic cereal beverage with L. reuteri as starter culture. This study provides a reference for the development of nondairy probiotic products. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zhoujie Yang; Anyan Wen; Likang Qin; Yi Zhu							Effect of coix seed extracts on growth and metabolism of Limosilactobacillus reuteri.		Foods					Coix seed (Coix lachryma-jobi L.) is an important nourishing food and traditional Chinese medicine. The role of their bioactive constituents in physiology and pharmacology has received considerable scientific attention. However, very little is known about the role of coix seed bioactive components in the growth of Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri). This study aimed to evaluate the effects of coix seed extract (CSE) on the growth, acidifying activity, and metabolism of L. reuteri. The results showed that CSE can increase the growth and acidifying activity of L. reuteri compared with the control group. During the stationary phase, the viable bacteria in the medium supplemented with coix seed oil (CSO, 13.72 Log10 CFU/mL), coix polysaccharide (CPO, 12.24 Log10 CFU/mL), and coix protein (CPR, 11.91 Log10 CFU/mL) were significantly higher (p< 0.05) than the control group (MRS, 9.16 Log10 CFU/mL). CSE also enhanced the biosynthesis of lactic acid and acetic acid of L. reuteri. Untargeted metabolomics results indicated that the carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and nucleotide metabolism activities of L. reuteri were increased after adding CSE. Furthermore, CSE increased the accumulation of bioactive metabolites, such as phenyl lactic acid, vitamins, and biotin. Overall, CSE may have prebiotic potential and can be used to culture L. reuteri with high viable bacteria. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Patulin is one of the most significant food safety problems in fruit and derived products. The reduction of patulin contamination in food processing has always been the focus of research. In this study, nine yeast strains were applied for the brewing of apple cider and the fate of patulin was determined. In this process, the patulin contamination can be decreased by adsorption onto and degradation of yeast cells in the main fermentation (20.8-49.1%), as well as the adsorption removal during clarification (18.7-58%), inverted cans (21.3-31.4%) and aging (1.0-5.8%). Saccharomyces cerevisiae (1027) was selected to reveal the elimination mechanism of patulin in main fermentation. The decrease of patulin content was mainly due to degradation and the intracellular enzymes played a more important role than extracellular ones. In addition, the synthesis of enzymes was related to the induction of patulin. Furthermore, the degradation product of patulin in the main fermentation was identified as E-ascladiol, which is less toxic than patulin. Based on the representative strain of S. cerevisiae 1027, patulin contamination can be effectively eliminated during apple cider brewing. This study provides a new insight into eliminating patulin contamination in the brewing of apple cider. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	6	1149	1162	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2022.2055155					FSTA:2022-10-Hq9052

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the volatile flavor compounds in brown rice flour (BRF) and brown rice noodles (BRNs) prepared by different methods. White rice flour (WRF) and white rice noodles (WRNs) were used for comparison. The results revealed significant differences in volatile flavor compounds between BRFs and BRNs, and the types of volatile flavor compound in BRF were more than WRF. Compared with WRF, aldehydes increased in the BRF produced by refilling. The primary volatile flavor compounds of brown rice flour made by crushing brown rice fully (BRF-F) were 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 2-heptanone, 2,3-butanedione, 2-octanone, 2-butanone, 1-hexanol, 1-pentanol, ethanol, 2-methylbutanol, 3-methylbutanol, and 2-methylpropanol. Ethyl acetate was found in all rice flour and rice noodle samples. The contents of 2-methylpropanol, 2-hexanone, 2-methylbutanal, 3-methylbutanal, ethanol and acetone increased after processing rice flour into rice noodles, while the contents of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 1-hexanol, 2-heptanone, 1-pentanol and 2,3-butanedione decreased. This research demonstrated the promising application of extrusion in fabricating brown rice flour with satisfactory flavor preservation for refilling in WRF.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a toxin that is widely present in food and feed and poses a serious threat to the health of humans and livestock. In this work, we proposed the quantitative detection method of AFB1 contamination using a simple, sensitive, and specific colorimetric immunoassay based on gold nanoparticles labeled with glucose oxidase (GOx) /rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G. In our strategy, Prussian blue was produced by a GOx catalyst-assisted Fe3+ and Fe(CN)63- system, which was designed and employed as a probe. Without GOx, the Fe3+ and Fe(CN)63-system containing glucose did not produce Prussian blue, while under the catalyzation of GOx, the H2O2 generated from glucose oxidation reduced Fe3+ to Fe2+, resulting in a visible color change from yellow to blue. With an increase in AFB1 concentration, the absorbance at 706 nm gradually decreased linearly from 0.5 ng/mL to 5 ng/mL, with a detection limit of 0.35 ng/mL. Thus, acceptable recovery (g/100g) (87.6-106.0) were achieved in the spiked rice flour samples. As a result, this simple, sensitive, and specific colorimetric method may be used for AFB1 evaluation in the food industry, and our work paves the way for the evaluation of other analytes using the respective antibodies.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Polyphenol-rich tea plants are aluminum (Al) accumulators. Whether an association exists between polyphenols and Al accumulation in tea plants remains unclear. This study revealed that the accumulation of the total Al and bound Al contents were both higher in tea samples with high flavonol content than in low, and Al accumulation in tea plants was significantly and positively correlated with their flavonol content. Furthermore, the capability of flavonols combined with Al was higher than that of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and root proanthocyanidins (PAs) under identical conditions. Flavonol-Al complexes signals (94 ppm) were detected in the tender roots and old leaves of tea plants through solid-state 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging, and the strength of the signals in the high flavonol content tea samples was considerably stronger than that in the low flavonol content tea samples. This study provides a new perspective for studying Al accumulation in different tea varieties.										2022	70	43	14096	14108	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04963					FSTA:2023-03-Hn2388

Food Hydrocolloids					Oyster peptides usually have strong off-flavors, which seriously affect the acceptability and application of products. Electrospinning of three commercial octenylsuccinylated (OS) starches (Purity Gum Ultra (PGU), Hi-Cap 100 (HC100) and Purity Gum 2000 (PG2000)) and pullulan (PUL) may be a potential method of adsorbing the odor of oyster peptides, which is simple, green and sustainable. All the electrospun PUL-OS starch fiber mats had an excellent white appearance with smooth, continuous, bead-free and randomly oriented nanofibers (70-240 nm). The adsorption rates of PUL-PGU, PUL-HC100 and PUL-PG2000 nanofiber mats for the volatile compounds of oyster peptides were 50.58%, 34.36% and 20.88%, respectively, attributing to physical adsorption evidenced by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. A significant positive correlation was observed between the pore areas of nanofiber mats and the adsorption rates of acids and alkanes, which may be related to the formation of pi-complexes on the nanofiber surface. For the first time, we demonstrated that the starch-based nanofiber mats prepared using a green process can improve the flavors of marine products.

J		Zhu Tian; Xueru Li; Xixiong Shi; Cheng Chen							Effects of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor on mitochondria apoptosis and meat quality in postmortem Gannan yak (Bos grunniens) meat.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This research aimed to explore the effects of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor (L-NAME) on mitochondria apoptosis in postmortem Gannan yak (Bos grunniens) longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle and to explore its effect on meat quality further. The Gannan yak meat samples were treated with the control group (0.9% NaCl) and L-NAME (20,60, and 100mM) for 24h and then stored for 0, 1, 3, 5, and 7 days at 4°C. NOS activity and NO content were investigated, and the parameters of mitochondrial apoptosis of the postmortem Gannan yak meat were determined. Meanwhile, the meat quality such as the centrifugation loss, meat color, and myofibril fragmentation index (MFI) was evaluated. The results indicated that after treatment with L-NAME, NOS activity and NO content decreased, causing mitochondrial membrane damage, Bax protein, and Cyt-c levels increased, and resulted in increased activities of caspase-9 and-3, promoting the occurrence of mitochondrial apoptosis. Furthermore, it increased the tenderness and water retention of Gannan yak meat. The results indicated that NOS inhibitor played a regulatory role in postmortem Gannan yak meat quality by regulating mitochondria apoptosis during postmortem aging. Practical applications. The meat's tenderness is often considered the most important factor affecting consumers' willingness to repurchase. The relationship of caspases and MFI suggested that L-NAME played a regulatory role in postmortem Gannan yak meat quality by regulating mitochondria apoptosis during postmortem aging. This study provides valuable information for the development of the Gannan yak economy in Tibetan areas. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	9			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14234					FSTA:2023-01-Sp0102

Food Chemistry					Lutein has limited applicability in the food industry because of its poor water solubility and chemical instability. In this study, amorphous and crystalline lutein-loaded microencapsulated powders were prepared via wet media milling and spray drying techniques. The breakage kinetics, surface morphology, physicochemical characteristics, encapsulation efficiency, dissolution behaviour, and storage stability of the two types of microencapsules were determined. Compared with the crystalline formulation, amorphous lutein nanoparticles displayed better breakability (~478.8 nm within 20min) in the milling process and faster dissolution rates under both sink and supersaturation conditions (88.0 1.7% and 47.0 3.8%, respectively, within 2min). Stability testing revealed that the amorphous formulation exhibited slower degradation rates, with decay constants k of 0.03 and 0.07 at 25 and 40°C, respectively. Our study results suggest that microencapsules with amorphous lutein nanoparticles represent a commercially viable formulation for maintaining chemical stability and improving oral bioavailability.

J		Zhuang Guo; Yurong Wang; Fanshu Xiang; Yun Dong; Qiangchuan Hou; Zhendong Zhang							Evaluating the flavor and divergent bacterial communities in corn-based zha-chili.		Food Bioscience					Zha-chili is a naturally fermented traditional food from central southern China. Corn-based zha-chili is one of the most popular varieties with a special flavor. To investigate its distinct microbiome, corn-based zha-chili samples were collected and investigated using both high-throughput sequencing and culture-dependent method. Subsequently, E-nose and E-tongue sensors were used to evaluate the overall sensory profile. We found that the bacterial communities present in zha-chili samples from the two regions were significantly different (P< 0.05). Companilactobacillus, Lactiplantibacillus, and Corynebacterium were found to be the dominant genera common to samples from both regions. Among these, lactic acid bacteria were the most dominant. Biomarker genera were Ligilactobacillus, Lactobacillus, and Levilactobacillus (Huaihua) and Pantoea, Lactiplantibacillus, and Weissella (Songtao). Using culture-dependent methods, the most dominant genus Companilactobacillus was found to comprise Companilactobacillus alimentarius and Companilactobacillus futsaii. The sensory profile was also characterized. This indicated that zha-chili from the two regions could be discriminated by sourness and aftertaste-B (E-taste), and W1C, W3C, W5C, W1S, W2S, W5S, and W2W (E-nose). Correlation analysis suggested that the dominant genera might not affect the aroma quality of corn-based zha-chili, whereas they were related to taste quality. Levilactobacillus and Ligilactobacillus were positively correlated with the characteristic taste indices and negatively correlated with the off-flavor indices. Another dominant genus, Kocuria was positively correlated with umami and richness (P< 0.05). Our results could provide a basis for supporting zha-chili production and help the isolation of appropriate lactic acid bacteria from corn-based zha-chili.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effects on physicochemical properties and shelf-life of regular-fat model sausages (RFMSs) added with oven-dried or freeze-dried lotus rhizome root powder (LRRP, ≤150m) at two different concentrations (0.5% or 1%) were investigated in this study. RFMSs added with LRRP showed decreased lightness (L*), reduced microbial counts, and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), but increased redness (a*), yellowness (b*), hardness, and cohesiveness. The changes in L*, a*, and b* of RFMSs treated with 1% oven-dried LRRP were the largest. Furthermore, addition of 1% oven-dried LRRP to the RFMSs minimised the TBARS value and the microbial count. RFMSs treated with LRRP had a denser and more compact microstructure than RFMSs without LRRP based on low-vacuum scanning electron microscopy analysis. Therefore, LRRP improved the shelf-life of RFMSs, especially 1% oven-dried LRRP inhibited the maximum lipid oxidation and microbial growth. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	4	2393	2401	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15595					FSTA:2022-07-Sr3341
J		Zhuang Zhuang Qiu; Koo Bok Chin							Evaluation of physicochemical properties and shelf life of regular-fat model sausages by wrapping with sodium alginate active film containing different levels and drying method of lotus rhizome root powder.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The objective of this study was to investigate shelf life effect of regular-fat model sausages (RFMSs) wrapped with sodium alginate films (SAFs) containing 1% dried lotus rhizome root powder (LRRP) with different drying methods. After SAF wrapping, the pH, moisture content, and expressible moisture of RFMSs were decreased, but the crude protein and fat contents tended to increase. One percent oven-dried LRRP was added to SAFs to make the SAFO, and its wrapping decreased total bacterial counts in RFMSs on day 21 and day 35. The microbial counts of Enterobacteriaceae of RFMSs wrapped with SAFO were lower than those of control RFMSs from day 28 to day 35. RFMSs wrapped with SAFs containing LRRP had higher chewiness and cohesiveness than those of control RFMSs (p< .05). Therefore, SAFO wrapping can retard microbial growth and prolong the shelf life of RFMSs since SAFs prevented microbial growth and LRRP had an antimicrobial activity. Novelty impact statement. This study evaluated the effect of sodium alginate film containing different levels of dried lotus rhizome root powders (LRRP) on product quality and shelf life of regular-fat model sausages (RFMSs). Sodium alginate film combined with 1% oven-dried LRRP inhibited the growth of microorganisms in RFMSs, thereby prolonging the shelf life. This might be useful for meat industries to reduce cost by preventing product loss during refrigerated storage. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16996					FSTA:2023-03-Sr1802

Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of different homogenization pressure levels on the solubility, particle size, surface hydrophobicity, free sulfhydryl content, surface tension, water distribution and mobility, rheological, foaming and gel properties of soy 11S globulin were investigated in this study. High-pressure homogenization treatment (50-150 MPa) significantly increased the magnitude of protein zeta potential, solubility, while reduced the particle size, which increased surface hydrophobicity, and exposure to free sulfhydryl and disulfide bonds, as well as surface tension, foaming capacity and stability, elasticity index, macroviscosity index, initial apparent viscosity and shear stress. On the other hand, excessive pressure treatment at 150 MPa caused solubility, surface hydrophobicity, exposure to free sulfhydryl, the elasticity index, macroviscosity index, initial apparent viscosity and shear stress to decrease. The gel strength and water immobilization also increased, whereas the mobility of the water was low. Overall, our results show that high-pressure homogenization improves the physicochemical, foaming and gel properties of 11S globulin.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Duckweeds are traditionally used as a plant protein source in some Southeast Asian countries. In this study, we first obtained a high-protein strain (Wolffia arrhiza 7678a) under artificial conditions and determined its protein content in 50.89% of dry weight. More importantly, we further investigated its nutritional properties. The digestible indispensable amino acids score (DIAAS) reached 0.75, indicating the good protein quality of W. arrhiza. The proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in total fatty acids (TFA) was 70.85%, and three main fatty acids (palmitic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid) accounted for 89.7% of TFA. Compared with the conventional crops, it had much higher contents of total phenolics and flavonoids and showed higher antioxidant activities. Also, the low concentrations of antinutritional factors could make the nutrients of W. arrhiza easily absorbed. Therefore, W. arrhiza showed a great potential value for human food.

Food Hydrocolloids					The interaction between beta-casein (beta-CN) and chlorogenic acid (CA) following treatments at 25, 65, 100, and 121 °C and their effects on the antioxidant capacity of resultant complexes were investigated. Fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that CA bound to beta-CN mainly via hydrophobic interactions, and thermal treatment at 121 °C weakened the binding affinity. Circular dichroism showed that CA and thermal treatment did not affect the secondary structure of beta-CN. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicated that, except for excessive CA, CA did not cause a significant change in the vibrational wavenumber of the amide II of beta-CN. According to the results of matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, no covalent bond was observed in the complexes formed between beta-CN and CA after thermal treatments. Assessments of antioxidant capacity indicated a synergistic effect observed between beta-CN and CA in FRAP and an antagonistic effect in ABTS. After 30 min of thermal treatment at 65 °C, beta-CN-CA complexes exhibited rather strong antioxidant capacity. These results support the use of CA in functional dairy beverages and maintaining their antioxidant capacity by modulating processing conditions.

J		Zhuchi Zhang; Muhindo, E. M.; Songjun Wang; Liyuan Yun; Min Zhang							Structural characteristics and immunostimulatory activity of sea cucumber tendon polysaccharides in cyclophosphamide-induced Balb/c mice.		Food & Function					Sea cucumber tendon, one of the main parts of sea cucumber viscera, is widely accepted as a waste residue. In this study, a sea cucumber tendon polysaccharide (SCTPII) was purified from sea cucumber tendons and its primary structures and immunomodulatory activity were investigated. SCTPII is a triple-helix conformation homogeneous polysaccharide with a molecular weight of 3.97 * 106 Da that consists of glucose and fucose with molar ratios of 92.09% and 7.91% with high thermostability. In vivo tests on immunosuppressed Balb/c mice revealed that compared with the model group, the proliferation of T cells and B cells in splenic lymphocytes of mice in the high-dose group was significantly improved by 0.92 times and 5.14 times, respectively. Additionally, SCTPII could improve the proliferation ability and phagocytosis of macrophages, as well as promoting the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma and enhancing the intestinal physical barrier function by increasing the protein expression of claudin-1, occludin, ZO-1 and MUC2. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA sequencing of fecal samples was performed, and gene count and alpha-diversity analysis revealed that SCTPs could improve the microbial community richness. In particular, SCTPs could increase the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Bacteroides and Akkermansia and reduce the relative abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group. These results demonstrate that SCPII possesses potential immunoregulatory activities in cyclophosphamide-induced mice by regulating intestinal microbiota diversity and improving immune organs, enhancing the proliferation ability of macrophages and splenocyte proliferation, and enhancing intestinal physical barrier function, which might provide important evidence for the development and utilization of the viscera of sea cucumber. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	16	8627	8642	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00942k					FSTA:2022-12-Rg4969
J		Zhulin Wang; Lin Shi; Hao Li; Wei Song; Jianke Li; Li Yuan							Selenium-enriched black soybean protein prevents benzo(a)pyrene-induced pyroptotic colon damage and gut dysbacteriosis.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Selenium-enriched black soybean protein (SeBSP) is a kind of high-quality selenium resource with many physiological functions. Benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is a well-known injurant that widely exists in high-temperature processed food and has been previously found to cause colon injury. In this study, the effects of SeBSP on colonic damage induced by BaP in BALB/C mice were investigated by comparing it with normal black soybean protein (BSP). SeBSP inhibited the BaP-induced reductions on body weight, food intake, and water intake. Moreover, metabolic enzymes, including AhR, CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and GST-P1, that were promoted by BaP were downregulated by SeBSP, reducing oxidative damage caused by BaP in the metabolic process. The classical pyroptosis indexes (i.e., NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, GSDMD) and inflammatory factors (i.e., TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-18, iNOS, COX-2) were downregulated by SeBSP in BaP-treated mice, suggesting the benefits of SeBSP in reducing colonic toxicity. Notably, SeBSP enhanced microbial diversity of gut microbiota and increased relative abundances of prebiotic bacteria, for example, Lactobacillus reuteri, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, and genera Bifidobacterium, and Blautia, along with the promotion of short-chain fatty acids. Integrative analysis showed strong links between the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of SeBSP and its altered gut microbiota. Collectively, our study demonstrates the pronounced benefits of Se-enriched black soybean in preventing the colonic toxicity of BaP, and such effects could be mediated by gut microbiota.										2022	70	39	12629	12640	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04526					FSTA:2023-02-Jn2346
J		Zhumei Du; Yanli Lin; Lin Sun; Fuyu Yang; Yimin Cai							Microbial community structure, co-occurrence network and fermentation characteristics of woody plant silage.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Feed shortage is a factor restricting animal production in the tropics, therefore how to use natural woody plant resources as animal feed is an important strategy. Results. Under the dual stress of an anaerobic and acidic environment, the microbial response during the fermentation of paper mulberry (PM) silage was found to be sensitive. The Gram-negative bacteria and mould died, and the dominant microbial community rapidly shifted to Gram-positive bacteria, resulting in a large reduction in microbial diversity and abundance. Exogenous bran additives interfered with the stress effects of the woody silage environment. Wheat bran (WB) accelerated the response of microorganisms to the anaerobic stress, and lactic acid bacteria became the dominant microbial community, thereby enhancing the lactic acid fermentation of silage, affecting the metabolic pathways of microorganisms, and improving the flavour and quality of the silage. Addition of rice bran made Enterobacter and Clostridium species quickly respond to the stress of the silage environment and become the predominant bacterial groups. In particular, anaerobic and spore-forming Clostridium species showed a strong tolerance to the silage environment, leading to butyric acid fermentation and protein degradation of the silage, and reducing its fermentation quality. Conclusion. The PacBio single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing technology accurately revealed the microbial co-occurrence network and fermentation mechanism of silage. Our results indicate that PM can be used in combination with WB to prepare high-quality silage for animal production. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	3	1193	1204	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11457					FSTA:2022-04-Ma2501

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Thermal stability of silver carp actin in summer and winter as well as the effect of myosin binding was investigated. Actin denaturation was detected by chymotryptic digestion with 1/200 (w/w) of myofibrillar protein (Mf). The temperature heated for 30min and reached 50% denaturation (T1/2) of actin was 47°C for summer and 42°C for winter at 0.1 M salt concentration. Denaturation rate of winter actin was eight, six, four, and three times more quickly than summer one under 42, 43, 45, and 48°C, respectively. T1/2 changed to 43°C for summer and 37°C for winter at 0.5 M salt concentration. With the rise of salt concentration from 0.1 to 2.0 M, the actin denaturation rate increased 10~60 times, but the difference between the two seasons disappeared above 1.5 M NaCl. T1/2 for both summer and winter actin fell to around 40°C when actin was separated from myosin by adding magnesium pyrophosphates (Mg-PPi). Denaturation rate was promoted by 3~8 times with Mg-PPi higher than that without it, besides actin in summer and winter showed similar denaturation rate. It could conclude that the difference in thermal stability of actin depends on the stability of myosin when binding together. Summer and winter actin in silver carp Mf showed similar thermal stability after being separated from myosin. Novelty impact statement. The differences in thermal stability of silver carp actin in winter and summer were studied for the first time. The interaction between myosin and actin under different conditions was studied by changing the salt concentrations, adding Mg-PPi, etc. It simulated the actual manufacturing of surimi products to some extent. Understanding seasonal changes in actin stability will help food processors in thermal processing design to produce textured fish meat products based on the raw materials harvested. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.17003					FSTA:2023-03-Rc1385

Food & Function					Apigenin is a kind of natural flavonoid that abundantly exists in fruits and vegetables. Pyroptosis is a new, pro-inflammatory type of programmed necrosis cell death, and the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is the key molecule to induce pyroptosis. Excessive hepatic pyroptosis results in liver injury. In the study, we found for the first time that apigenin could alleviate palmitic acid (PA)-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pyroptosis in HepG2 cells and primary mouse hepatic cells. Meanwhile, apigenin could promote the autophagy of hepatocytes. When the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) was added, the data showed that the recovery effect of apigenin on PA-induced pyroptosis was weakened, indicating that apigenin could alleviate PA-induced pyroptosis by activating autophagy. Further mechanistic studies showed that apigenin regulated the NLRP3 inflammasome through two ways, so as to alleviate PA-induced pyroptosis. On the one hand, apigenin eliminated damaged mitochondria by activating autophagy, thereby clearing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, and on the other hand, activation of autophagy could directly degrade the NLRP3 inflammasome. Our study provides a new idea and target for the use of functional factors in food to alleviate liver injury. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	10	5559	5570	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03771d					FSTA:2022-09-Aj16699

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the microbial control efficacy of five pre-drying treatments and three drying protocols commonly used by small and medium dried peach processors. Salmonella spp. and Enterococcus faecium (Ef) were used for inoculation. Except for blanching, 10-min dipping treatments in ascorbic acid, citric acid, lemon juice, or sodium metabisulfite reduced Salmonella by 0.54-2.40 Log CFU/peach half. The detection of Salmonella in used dipping solution highlighted the potential risks of cross-contamination during dipping treatments. Drying in an oven or a dehydrator at 60°C reduced the inoculated Salmonella and Ef by 1.47 and 0.91 Log CFU/peach half. The internal temperature of peach halves reached during sun-drying is lower than the internal temperature reached during oven-or dehydrator-drying. Exposure to simulated sunlight (UV) could resulted in up to 6.75 Log reduction of Ef with higher reduction observed from peach halves with lower water activities. Salmonella and Ef could survive on dried peaches for up to 90 days with greater reduction observed on dried peaches made with sulfur dioxide treatment and at ambient temperature. Ef showed higher resistance than Salmonella in two pre-drying dipping treatments and survived better than Salmonella on dried peaches made without sulfur treatment at ambient temperature.

Food Bioscience					Camellia flowers are an important oil source containing abundant phenolic compounds. The free and bound phenolic, flavonoid, and proanthocyanidin fractions and their antioxidant activity were investigated in Camellia oleifera flowers and Camellia polyodonta flowers, stamens, and petals. Phenolic compounds in C. oleifera were studied using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, which revealed 85 phenolics, including flavonols > ellagitannins > procyanidins > phenolic acids > flavanone > organic acids. Free fractions contributed more greatly to phenolic content and antioxidant capacity than bound fractions in all samples. The highest total phenolics (138.96 mg GAE/g DW), total flavonoids (423.20 mg RE/g DW), and total proanthocyanidins (61.08 mg PB2E/g DW) were obtained in the C. polyodonta flowers, which also exhibited the highest total antioxidant activity. In terms of individual phenolic components, C. polyodonta possessed the highest content of procyanidin B2, procyanidin B4, procyanidin C1, and epicatechin, while C. oleifera displayed the highest content of flavonoids such as quercitrin and afzelin, particularly in the petals. These results implied that Camellia flowers are important natural sources of active components for use in the food industry.

J		Zhuoyan Fan; Haichao Wen; Xiaoxu Zhang; Jingming Li; Jiachen Zang							Cyanidin 3-O-Beta-galactoside alleviated cognitive impairment in mice by regulating brain energy metabolism during aging.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Metabolic disorder, which commonly happens among senile people worldwide, is an important sign of aging. The early symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include a decrease in energy metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Comparably, early dietary intervention may be more effective in preventing or delaying brain aging, owing to its role in regulating metabolism. Polyphenol intake has shown its potential in preventing Alzheimer's disease. However, whether there are close connections between polyphenols and the energy metabolism of the brain during aging remains unclear. This study sought to evaluate whether cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside from black chokeberry (Aronia melanocarpa (Michx.) Elliott) has positive effects on energy metabolism, as well as cognitive function in aging mice. Intragastrical administration of cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside (25 and 50 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks effectively alleviated the decline in brain glucose uptake (decline rate 18.29% versus 1.05%, 7.63%) of aging mice. Moreover, cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside also alleviated neuronal damage in the hippocampus (number of neurons 212.33 16.19 versus 285.33 29.53, 301.67 10.07; p< 0.05) and cortex (number of neurons 82.00 4.58 versus 111.67 6.51, 112.00 1.00; p< 0.05). Furthermore, cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside reduced beta-amyloid load in the brain and significantly increased the crossing-platform number (0.92 1.11 versus 1.83 0.68, 2.08 0.58; p< 0.05) in the Morris water maze test. We further determined that protein kinase B (AKT) might be the target of cyanidin 3-O-beta-galactoside, which played a beneficial role in controlling the energy metabolism of the brain. These results suggested that early intervention of anthocyanins could promote neuroprotection under the challenge of brain energy metabolism.										2022	70	4	1111	1121	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c06240					FSTA:2022-06-Jf6883

Food & Function					The effects of Cucumaria frondosa polysaccharides (CFPs) on renal interstitial fibrosis by regulating the phosphatidylinositol-3-hydroxykinase/protein kinase-B/nuclear factor-kappaB (PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB) signaling pathway were investigated in vivo and in vitro in this research. The common unilateral urethral obstruction (UUO) model was used to examine the renoprotective effect and its mechanism in vivo. Compared to the UUO group, CFP administration could ameliorate renal function, inhibit inflammation and fibrosis, and reduce the deposition of the extracellular matrix and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistic results indicated that CFPs could inhibit the expression of the total protein of PI3K and the conversion of the AKT and NF-kappaB p65 phosphorylated proteins, thereby inhibiting the transduction of the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB pathway. In addition, CFP treatment could improve inflammation and fibrosis in HK-2 cells induced by TGF-beta1, and its in vitro mechanism was also verified to inhibit the PI3K/Akt/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. Overall, these results showed that CFP could alleviate renal interstitial fibrosis related to the PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB signaling pathway. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	3	1168	1179	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03067a					FSTA:2022-06-Rg2039
J		Zhuozhuo Zhu; Xinhua Zhu; Wenchuan Guo							Quantitatively determining the somatic cell count of raw milk using dielectric spectra and support vector regression.		Journal of Dairy Science					To investigate the potential of dielectric spectroscopy in quantitatively determining the somatic cell count (SCC) of raw milk, the dielectric spectra of 301 raw milk samples at different SCC were collected using coaxial probe technology in the frequency range of 20 to 4,500 MHz. Standard normal variate, Mahalanobis distance, and joint x-y distances sample division were used to pretreat spectra, detect outliers, and divide samples, respectively. Principal component analysis and variable importance in projection (VIP) methods were used to reduce data dimension and select characteristic variables (CVR), respectively. The full spectra, 16 principal components obtained by principal component analysis, and 86 CVR selected by VIP were used as inputs, respectively, to establish different support vector regression models. The results showed that the nonlinear support vector regression models based on the full spectra and selected CVR using VIP had the best prediction performance, with the standard error of prediction and residual predictive deviation of 0.19 log SCC/mL and 2.37, respectively. The study provided a novel method for online or in situ detection of the SCC of raw milk in production, processing, and consumption.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Fresh-cut browning is a significant global challenge for fresh-cut produce. Riboflavin has been studied in terms of physiological function; however, its effect on fresh-cut browning remains elusive. Here, the changes in quality attributes including browning, phenolic metabolism, and oxidative metabolism were compared between fresh-cut apples treated with riboflavin coupled with LED-blue illumination, and control. LED-based riboflavin treatment is an effective strategy for quality preservation of fresh-cut apples, as indicated by controlled browning, microbial growth, weight loss and softening, as well as improved whiteness and soluble solid content. Enzymatic activities of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase were repressed by the riboflavin application, whereas the phenolic content was enhanced. The reduced membrane peroxidation can be explained by the impairment of H2O2 accumulation due to an enhanced antioxidant system. In conclusion, photosensitizing riboflavin can reduce the browning of fresh-cut apples by inhibiting phenolic metabolism and strengthening the antioxidant system to avoid membrane peroxidation.

J		Zhuqian Xiao; Xinyi Yang; Wenwen Zhao; Zhenzhen Wang; Qing Ge							Physicochemical properties of insoluble dietary fiber from pomelo (Citrus grandis) peel modified by ball milling.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This work is focused on the modification of insoluble dietary fiber from pomelo (Citrus grandis) peel (PP-IDF) by ball milling. Ball milling intensified water and oil holding capacity and water swelling capacity by 43.7%, 65.1%, and 107.5%, respectively. Besides, 97.1% of taurocholic acid, 45.3% of glucose, and 9.3 mug/mg of NO2- were bound by milled insoluble dietary fibers (IDFs). The oil-in-water Pickering emulsions were successfully emulsified by ball-milled PP-IDFs. The ball-milled PP-IDF for 2.0 hr (PP-IDF-BM2h) exhibited higher stability after storage owing to its relative strong electrostatic and steric repulsions intensified by milling process. A simulated three-stage gastrointestinal tract (GIT) model was employed to explore the physical stability of emulsion in the digestive system. Ball milling contributed promotion on stability emulsion but ion strength in simulated liquids predominated in affecting zeta potential. Overall, ball milling extended green protocols for modification of properties for dietary fiber, providing a promising application in food industry. Practical applications. For safety consideration, materials used for food processing should be in low toxicity with less employment of chemicals. Hence, it is essential to develop a green and renewable strategy to modify properties of dietary fiber (DF) in food applications. Ball milling is a simple and low cost strategy that can effectively improve or modify physicochemical properties including crystallinity, surface potential, water and oil holding capacities, and hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. Importantly, ball milling can treat dietary fiber in batch processing with no waste and chemicals, which is suitable for industrial applications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16242					FSTA:2022-05-Jc6580

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Recent studies indicated a strong relationship between carotenoids and gut microflora. However, their structure-activity relationship remains unclear. This study evaluated the interaction between four typical carotenoids (beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and astaxanthin) and gut microflora using an in vitro fermentation model. After 24 h of fermentation, the retention rates of the four carotenoids were 1.40, 1.38, 1.46, and 5.63 times lower than those of their without gut microflora control groups, respectively. All four carotenoid treated groups significantly increased total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. All carotenoid supplements significantly promoted the abundance of Roseburia and Parasutterella and inhibited the abundance of Collinsella, while beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, and astaxanthin significantly promoted the abundance of Ruminococcus, Sutterella, Subdoligranulum, and Megamonas, respectively. Furthermore, xanthophylls have a more significant impact on gut microflora than carotenes. This study provides a new way to understand how carotenoids work in the human body with the existing gut microflora.										2022	70	42	13592	13601	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03464					FSTA:2023-03-Aj4937

Food Research International					Plant-based meat alternatives (PMAs) is a new type of food that meets people's health needs, but the lack of awareness of its nutritional properties limits product development and promotion. Here, we compared the similarities and differences of the nutritional properties of PMAs and meat before and after in vitro simulation of gastrointestinal digestion by chemical composition analysis, peptidomics and bioactivity tests. The molecular weights of Plant-based meat alternatives derived peptides (PDPs) as well as meat-derived peptides (MDPs) in the beef and pork groups were mainly concentrated in the low mass range from 800 Da to 1500 Da. The principal component analysis indicated that the composition of MDPs in the beef and pork groups significantly differed from PDPs but overlapped slightly with the chicken group. Also, there were very few common peptides among them. The proportion of high-biological-scoring peptides (33.3%-40%) in PDPs was more than that in MDPs (4.8%-20.8%). PDPs were predicted to have higher antibacterial activity than others. PDPs and MDPs showed a certain antioxidant capacity and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitory activity (62.2%-92.5%) in vitro. Some peptides weakly inhibited the growth of Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) while promoting the growth of probiotics. This research provides a theoretical basis for in-depth exploration of the nutritional characteristics of PMAs.

J		Zhuzhu Wang; Qianyi Wu; Mohammed Kamruzzaman							Portable NIR spectroscopy and PLS based variable selection for adulteration detection in quinoa flour.		Food Control					Quinoa flour is prone to economically motivated adulteration due to its high nutritional value and growing demand worldwide. In this study, portable near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with multivariate analysis was used to detect adulteration in quinoa flour. The initial investigation was carried out using principal component analysis (PCA) and uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) to identify the most potential adulterate in quinoa flour. Quinoa flour samples were then adulterated with identified adulterant in the range of 0-51% (w/w). The partial least squares regression (PLSR) model built with original spectral data had the best performance for detecting the level of adulteration, with a coefficient of determination (Rp2) of 0.94, root-mean-square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 3.04%, ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) of 4.04, and range error ratio (RER) of 11.84. The variable importance in projection (VIP) resulting from the PLSR model was used to select 13 informative spectral bands. The new PLSR model led to an R2p of 0.98, RMSEP of 1.60%, RPD of 7.71, and RER of 22.56. The results demonstrated the potential of portable NIRS as a rapid, low cost and non-destructive analytical tool for adulteration detection in quinoa flour .© 2022 Elsevier Ltd.

Food Chemistry					This work monitored the effect of ripening and variety on the physiochemical quality and flavor of fermented Chinese chili pepper (Paojiao). Three commercial varieties of chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens Linn.) at three ripening stages were selected. Physiochemical quality (color, texture, and vitamin C) and flavor properties [capsaicinoids, free amino acid (FAA), and aroma] were determined and compared by multivariate data analysis. The hardness and chewiness decreased, while the contents of vitamin C, capsaicin, and taste-active FAAs increased in Paojiao with ripening. More volatiles were found in green peppers. Fingerprinting and multivariate data analysis revealed that ester, aldehydes, and terpenes were discriminant volatiles that significantly changed in Paojiao during ripening. In general, ripening and variety greatly affect the physiochemical and flavor quality of peppers and their effects intensify after fermentation.

Food Research International					Pickled chili pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.), a traditional Chinese fermented vegetable product, is favored by consumers because of its unique flavor. Microbial succession is the main factor affecting the development of the typical flavor of pickled chili pepper. This study investigated the dynamics of flavor changes (mouthfeel sensation, taste properties, and aroma profile) and microbial diversity (bacterial and fungal communities) during the industrial-scale fermentation of pickled chili pepper. Results revealed that during fermentation, the hardness and pungency of pickled chili pepper decreased significantly (P< 0.05), whereas organic acids, free amino acids, and volatiles (especially terpenes, alcohols, and aldehydes) increased significantly (P< 0.05). Lactobacillus and Candida species, specifically, Lactobacillus brevis and Candida sp. F15, dominated in pickled chili pepper. Correlation analysis indicated that the dominant bacterial (Lactobacillus versmoldensis and L. brevis) and fungal (Colletotrichum simmondsii and Cladosporium tenuissimum) species had a high positive correlation with volatile compounds (e.g., aldehydes, terpenes, and esters).

Food Chemistry					Herein, a novel hemicyanine derivative (E)-3-(1,1-dimethyl-2-(4-(methylthio) styryl)-1 H-benzo [e] indol-3-ium-3-yl) propane-1-sulfonate (BIS) has been reasonably designed. Compound BIS is long-wavelength emissive and water-soluble with a large Stokes shift. Intriguingly, probe BIS provides a dual-mode fluorescence response pattern for the sensing of bisulfite (HSO3-) and hypochlorous acid (HClO) with great limit of detections (3.6 and 57.4 nM). First, the 1,4-Michael addition of HSO3- on the conjugated double bond triggers a ratiometric response (I465/ I575). Second, the rapid oxidation of HClO on the thioether moiety provides a turn-on response (I575). Evaluation of HSO3- and HClO levels in dried fruit, beverage, and water samples has been carried out with satisfactory results. Moreover, motivated by an impressive chromatic variation (red to blue), smartphone-assisted signal readout system and thin-film sensing platform are facilely constructed for real-time and on-site measurement of HSO3- levels. Furthermore, probe BIS is used for the in vivo imaging of HSO3- in edible fish models.

Food Chemistry					The shelf life of chestnut rose beverage is largely dependent on packaging method and storage temperature. In this study, we investigated the effects of packaging beverages in bottles made of either polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) /PET and storage temperature (4, 25, 37, and 55 °C) on the shelf life of chestnut rose beverage. The physicochemical parameters and enzyme activity of beverages were evaluated, and we found that at 4 °C, the vitamin C, superoxide dismutase, and total polyphenol contents of beverages stored in PEN/PET bottles increased by 9.950.49%, 2.860.13%, and 3.230.09% respectively, compared to beverages in ordinary PET bottles. In addition, other characteristic indicators including total soluble solids, browning index, and color value were also significantly improved. A shelf-life model was established based on the Arrhenius equation, and it will help distributors and consumers to determine the storage time and optimal shelf life of chestnut rose beverage.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is one of the leading crops worldwide, containing high nutritional components such as fiber and polyphenols. Root tuber of Simon 1 (SIMON), a cultivar of sweet potato, is a folk food in China with a hemostasis function but lacking experimental data support. Methods and results. Now the protective effect of SIMON on chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia (CIT), a serious complication of cancer treatment, is investigated for the first time by a CIT mouse model induced by intraperitoneal injection of carboplatin. As a result, SIMON raises the number of peripheral platelets, white blood cells, and bone marrow nucleated cells in CIT mice significantly. Besides, carboplatin-induced atrophy of the thymus, spleen, and disordered metabolism of the inflammatory immune system and glycerophospholipids are also reversed by SIMON. Phytochemical analysis of SIMON indicates 16 compounds including eight phenolic derivatives, which might be associated with its anti-CIT bioactivity. Conclusion. Sweet potato (SIMON) may be an efficient function food in the prevention of bleeding disorders. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	16			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202200126					FSTA:2022-12-Jk16747

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A simple and sensitive fluoroimmunoassay (FIA) based on a heavy-chain antibody (VHH) for rapid detection of fenitrothion was developed. A VHH library was constructed from an immunized alpaca, and one clone recognizing fenitrothion (namely, VHHjd8) was achieved after careful biopanning. It was biotinylated by fusing with the Avi tag and biotin ligase to obtain a fusion protein (VHHjd8-BT), showing both binding capacity to fenitrothion and the streptavidin poly-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (SA-polyHRP). Based on a competitive assay format, the absorbance spectrum of oxidized 3, 3′, 5, 5′-tetramethylbenzidine generated by SA-polyHRP overlapped the emission spectrum of carbon dots, which resulted in quenching of signals due to the inner-filter effect. The developed FIA showed an IC50 value of 1.4 ng/mL and a limit of detection of 0.03 ng/mL, which exhibited 15-fold improvement compared with conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The recovery test of FIA was validated by standard GC-MS/MS, and the results showed good consistency, indicating that the assay is an ideal tool for rapid screening of fenitrothion in bulk food samples.										2022	70	13	4102	4111	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00826					FSTA:2022-08-Cf2495

Food Chemistry					In this study, glycated soy beta-conglycinin (beta-CG) stabilized curcumin (Cur) composites were fabricated by a unique reversible self-assembly character of beta-conglycinin-dextran conjugates (beta-CG-DEX). Intrinsic fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra revealed that glycation did not affect the self-assembly property of beta-CG in the pH-shifting treatment. The structure of beta-CG-DEX could be unfolded at pH 12.0 and reassembled during acidification (from pH 12.0 to 7.0). Meanwhile, beta-CG-DEX-3d, which was incubated at 60°C for 3 days, exhibited a high loading capacity (123.4 mg/g) for curcumin, which far exceeds that (74.90 mg/g) of beta-CG-Cur. Moreover, the reassembled beta-CG-DEX-3d-Cur showed eminent antioxidant activity of approximately 1.5 times higher than that of free curcumin. During the simulated gastrointestinal condition, compared with beta-CG-Cur, beta-CG-DEX-3d-Cur nanoparticles showed a more stable and sustained release of curcumin. Thus, beta-CG-DEX has immense potential to become a new delivery carrier for hydrophobic food components by means of a self-assembly strategy.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					A new drying technology, far-infrared radiation heating assisted pulsed vacuum drying (FIR-PVD) was applied to process blueberries. Influences of drying temperature, vacuum pressure duration (VPD), and ambient pressure duration (APD) on drying characteristics and quality attributes of blueberries were investigated under FIR-PVD. Results showed that drying temperature, APD, and VPD had significant influence on drying time and quality attributes of dried blueberries expect for color and cohesiveness. Compared to hot air dried blueberries, FIR-PVD seriously damaged the cellular walls of blueberries during drying at 65°C. The highest total phenolics (TP) and total monomeric anthocyanins (TMA) contents of dried blueberries were obtained at 65°C with pulsed ratio of 15min: 4min and 15min: 2min, respectively. The FIR-PVD products obtained lower color difference, better mechanical properties and rehydration performance and maintained higher antioxidant capacity by shortening drying time, reducing exposure to oxygen, and modifying the microstructure compared to hot air drying. Industrial relevance Blueberry is a popular function fruit around the world. With high moisture content and tender tissue, fresh blueberry is very susceptible to microbial infection even under low temperature storage conditions. Drying is a good alternative to extend the shelf life and increase the availability of fresh blueberries. However, the existence of waxy hydrophobic layer covered the surface of blueberries inhibits moisture diffusion during drying. Chemical dipping and thermal blanching pretreatments were usually used to reduce the influence of skin hydrophobicity and promote moisture diffusion. Nevertheless, the chemical additive residue leads to food safety risk and it's a big challenge to deal with the corrosive waste chemical solutions, while thermal blanching resulted a high loss of bioactive compounds. FIR-PVD is a recent developed emerging drying technology to process berries with waxy layer beyond pretreatments. Results indicated that FIR-PVD is a very promising technology for processing blueberries with the improvement of drying efficiency and quality attributes.

Foods					Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) may lead to abnormally elevated blood glucose, lipid metabolism disorder, and low-grade inflammation. Besides, the development of T2DM is always accompanied by gut microbiota dysbiosis and metabolic dysfunction. In this study, the T2DM mice model was established by feeding a high-fat/sucrose diet combined with injecting a low dose of streptozotocin. Additionally, the effects of oral administration of ethanol extract from Sanghuangporous vaninii (SVE) on T2DM and its complications (including hypoglycemia, hyperlipidemia, inflammation, and gut microbiota dysbiosis) were investigated. The results showed SVE could improve body weight, glycolipid metabolism, and inflammation-related parameters. Besides, SVE intervention effectively ameliorated the diabetes-induced pancreas and jejunum injury. Furthermore, SVE intervention significantly increased the relative abundances of Akkermansia, Dubosiella, Bacteroides, and Parabacteroides, and decreased the levels of Lactobacillus, Flavonifractor, Odoribacter, and Desulfovibrio compared to the model group (LDA > 3.0, p< 0.05). Metabolic function prediction of the intestinal microbiota by PICRUSt revealed that glycerolipid metabolism, insulin signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and fatty acid degradation were enriched in the diabetic mice treated with SVE. Moreover, the integrative analysis indicated that the key intestinal microbial phylotypes in response to SVE intervention were strongly correlated with glucose and lipid metabolism-associated biochemical parameters. These findings demonstrated that SVE has the potential to alleviate T2DM and its complications by modulating the gut microbiota imbalance. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zi-Wei Wang; Ya-Nan Gao; Sheng-Nan Huang; Jia-Qi Wang; Nan Zheng							Ex vivo and in vitro studies revealed underlying mechanisms of immature intestinal inflammatory responses caused by aflatoxin M1 together with ochratoxin A.		Toxins					Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) and ochratoxin A (OTA), which are occasionally detected in milk and commercial baby foods, could easily enter and reach the gastrointestinal tract, posing impairment to the first line of defense and causing dysfunction of the tissue. The objective of this study was to investigate the immunostimulatory roles of individual and combined AFM1 and OTA on the immature intestine. Thus, we used ELISA assays to evaluate the generation of cytokines from ex vivo CD-1 fetal mouse jejunum induced by AFM1 and OTA and explored the related regulatory pathways and pivot genes using RNA-seq analysis. It was found that OTA exhibited much stronger ability in stimulating pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 from jejunum tissues than AFM1 (OTA of 4muM versus AFM1 of 50muM), whereas the combination of the two toxins seemed to exert antagonistic actions. In addition, transcriptomics also showed that most gene members in the enriched pathway "cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction" were more highly expressed in OTA than the AFM1group. By means of PPI network analysis, NFKB1 and RelB were regarded as hub genes in response to OTA but not AFM1. In the human FHs 74 Int cell line, both AFM1 and OTA enhanced the content of reactive oxygen species, and the oxidative response was more apparent in OTA-treated cells in comparison with AFM1. Furthermore, OTA and AFM1 + OTA raised the protein abundance of p50/RelB, and triggered the translocation of the dimer from cytosol to nucleus. Therefore, the experimental data ex vivo and in vitro showed that OTA-induced inflammation was thought to be bound up with the up-regulation and translocation of NF-kappaB, though AFM1 seemed to have no obvious impact. Since it was the first attempt to uncover the appearances and inner mechanisms regarding inflammation provoked by AFM1 and OTA on immature intestinal models, further efforts are needed to understand the detailed metabolic steps of the toxin in cells and to clarify their causal relationship with the signals proposed from current research. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Peony seed phospholipids (PPLs), a kind of multifunctional plant-like phospholipids were extracted from peony seed meal. We investigated the functional properties of PPLs and compared their emulsification performance in corn oil-peony seed oil o/w emulsion systems with that of soy lecithin (DPLs). The PPLs were characterized with the higher content of phosphatidylcholine (PC) (416 28mg/g) and lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) (43 14mg/g) fractions, and lower content of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) (71 13mg/g). The polyunsaturated fatty acids showed higher content (83.25%), with the highest content of linoleic acid (46.05%) in PPLs. PPLs-emulsions showed smaller average particle size and higher loaded peony seed oil content at pH 5, temperature 50°C, and about 60% corn oil content. PPLs-emulsions imparted better hydroxyl radical scavenging efficiency and reducing power than DPLs. Our results suggest that PPLs can be used as emulsifiers with improved antioxidant properties.

The cooking also changed the secondary structures of the proteins in SAM with the rising beta-sheet and descending alpha-helix, and the chemical interactions with the rising hydrophobic interactions and disulfide bonds but the descending ionic bonds and hydrogen bonds. These caused the longitudinal shrinkage and transverse aggregation of muscle fibers, and the aggregation and cross-linking between myofibrils which led to the squeeze of immobile water from myofibril network structure. This indicated that the denaturation, oxidation, aggregation and cross-linking of proteins caused by heat treatment changed the microstructure and water distribution, which contributed to the increased textural indicators of sous-vide cooked SAM.

Food Chemistry					The oxidation products and metabolic pathways of five Citrus flavonoids were studied by online electrochemical/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (EC/Q-TOF/MS). The simulated oxidation metabolism of target compounds in phase I and phase II was carried out at boron-doped diamond (BDD) working electrode. The results obtained by EC-MS were compared with the conventional metabolism of rats and humans reported in previous literatures. In addition, the method of incubating the target compounds with rat liver microsomes in vitro was established, the target compounds and their metabolites were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry. The structures of the metabolites were determined by accurate mass measurements and previous in vivo metabolite results. The results showed that the electrochemical oxidation metabolites were consistent with the results of in vitro incubation of liver microsomes, and also with the results reported in other literatures. As a consequence, EC/Q-TOF/MS is a promising and effective tool for studying metabolic transformation of different complex food components.

J		Zi-Xuan Yue; Jun Cao							A rapid and sensitive method for the simultaneous determination of multipolar compounds in plant tea by supercritical fluid chromatography coupled to ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry.		Foods					In this study, matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) microextraction combined with supercritical fluid chromatography-ion mobility quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (SFC/IM-QTOF-MS) was used to analyze the multipolar compounds in plant tea. The parameters of stationary phase, mobile phase, make-up solution, temperature, and back pressure were optimized. The target analytes were gradient eluted in 8min by supercritical CO2 on a Zorbax RX-SIL column. Collisional Cross Section (CCS) values for single and multiple fields were measured. A series of validation studies were carried out under the optimal conditions, and the linear relationship and reproducibility were good. The limits of detection were 1.4 (Scoparone (1)) ~70 (Naringenin (4)) ng/mL, and the limits of quantification were 4.7 (Scoparone (1)) ~241 (Naringenin (4)) ng/mL. The recoveries of most compounds ranged from 60.7% to 127%. As a consequence, the proposed method was used for the separation and quantitative analysis of active ingredients in caulis dendrobii. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The variations in the flavour substances of different varieties of camellia seed oil and the effect of the refining process were studied by headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-IMS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed that in different kinds and different processing stages of camellia seed oil, the flavour substances were mainly composed of aldehydes, ketones, heterocycles, alcohols, esters and acids. Moreover, the contents of aldehydes and ketones significantly were higher than the rest substances. These substances with a relative odour activity value (ROAV) greater than 1 in the sample were selected as the analysis objects to evaluate influence on flavor of camellia seed oil. The flavour fingerprints from different Camellia varieties and the effect of refining stages on the flavor of camellia seed oil were established based on the detected volatile compounds.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The inhibition of punicalagin on tyrosinase and melanogenesis was investigated through multiple spectroscopic approaches, molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulation, cell assay, and preservation assays. The results confirmed that punicalagin significantly inhibited tyrosinase activity in vitro (IC50= 0.64 0.05mM) and B16F10 cells (IC50= 16 0.7muM). The binding of punicalagin to tyrosinase changed the conformation of the enzyme by influencing the hydrophobicity and polar environment of the binding site. The results of molecular docking and thermodynamic analysis showed that hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond were major driving forces in stabilizing the punicalagin-tyrosinase complex, influencing substrate-binding affinity to tyrosinase and resulting in tyrosinase activity reduction. Molecular dynamic analysis indicated that punicalagin stretched the basic framework structure of tyrosinase and lowered the surface hydrophobicity of the enzyme. Cell analyses further demonstrated that punicalagin inhibited melanogenesis by down-regulating the expressions of MITF and tyrosinase. What's more, preservation assays showed that punicalagin could reducing the oxidation of phenols to melanin by inhibiting the polyphenol oxidase, thereby preventing the browning of fresh-cut apples. These findings provided new perspectives on the inhibition mechanism of punicalagin on tyrosinase/melanogenesis and a theoretical support for its feasible application in the food and medicine industry.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Biologically active peptides with tyrosinase inhibitory activity may be important raw materials in the field of whitening foods. Gastrointestinal digestion was employed to obtain components with higher tyrosinase inhibitory activity from the grass carp fish scale gelatin hydrolysates. The results revealed that the product had stronger tyrosinase inhibitory activity after gastrointestinal digestion than before. The digested products were screened using bioaffinity ultrafiltration for tyrosinase inhibitory activity for the first time, yielding 6 peptides. As a reversible competitive inhibitor, FTGML showed the highest IC50 value of 1.89 mmol/L. The main forces between FTGML and tyrosinase was dominated by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction. Zebrafish models for skin whitening and lightning were established respectively to verify the effect of FTGML in vivo, and it was discovered that FTGML concentrations of 125 mug/mL and 62.5 mug/mL had the best whitening and lightning effects, respectively.

J		Zia Qureshi, I.; Ud Din, N.; Ghulam Khadija; Aneeqa Shahzadi; Bakhtawer Rafiq; Hina Afaqi							Adverse physiologic effects of a common food additive potassium metabisulfite (E224) in laboratory rats.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Current study investigated the effects of potassium metabisulfite (E224), a common food preservative, in male rats following 28 days of oral exposure at doses: 0.7, 7.0, and 70 mg/kg b.w. Following autopsies, blood and tissues samples (liver, kidney, brain, and testes) were taken. Data were compared statistically at p<.05. Potassium metabisulfite caused significant dose-dependent reduction in most hematological parameters except the white blood cells and platelets that showed elevation. Biochemically, dose-dependent significant increase occurred in the oxidative stress biomarkers, the reactive oxygen species, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, while a concomitant significant decrease was noticeable in the antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and non-enzymatic reduced glutathione and as well as total protein content in liver, kidneys, brain, and testes of treated animals. Mild to relatively severe histological alterations were noticeable in all tissues. The study for the first time shows that potassium metabisulfite is toxic even in very small quantity. Novelty impact statement. Potassium metabisulphite designated as E224 is a food preservative used in many food items, but its effects on physiological health are lacking. Rats exposed to its oral doses for 28 continuous days demonstrated that it is toxic even at the lowest recommended concentration of 0.7 mg/kg body weight. It produces excessive free radicals and has every potential to damage the cells biochemically and structurally when used in slightly greater amounts. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16393					FSTA:2022-07-Tb2625
J		Ziagova, M. G.; Mavromatidou, C.; Samiotis, G.; Amanatidou, E.							Total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of Greek medicinal and aromatic plant extracts using pulsed electric field followed by ultrasounds extraction process.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of this study was to evaluate an advanced water extraction method applying pulsed electric field followed by ultrasound. For this purpose, antioxidant capacity (AC) and total phenolic content (TPC) of Olea europaea L. leaves and unripe fruit, Melissa officinalis L. leaves, Cistus incanus L. ssp. creticus leaves, Vitis vinifera L. cv. "Xinomavro" leaves, marc, and fruits, Aronia melanocarpa L. fruits , Punica granatum L. peel, and Crocus sativus L. petals were analyzed. The results showed that a ratio of 1/20g plant material/ml water, 5min pulsed electric field and 30min ultrasounds presented the maximum extraction efficiency. Melissa officinalis L. and Punica granatum L. had high TPC exhibiting 155mg GAE/g DW (DW: dry weight) and 208mg GAE/g DW, respectively, comparing to Vitis vinifera L. marc (31mg GAE/g DW). All aqueous extracts studied, had high AC approaching 90% (except 32% in Crocus sativus L. petals and Vitis vinifera L. marc). Practical applications. The beneficial use of medicinal and aromatic plants extracts in human health has been widely accepted. However, the efficiency of the process for the extraction of phenolic compounds from plants constitutes a challenge, since it is highly depended on the applied technique itself and the imposed operating conditions. In this regard, this work studies the application of a novel combined process of pulsed electric field extraction followed by ultrasounds assisted extraction for the recovery of polyphenols from selected Mediterranean plants. The evaluated process showed high extraction yields at short processing time and at moderate temperatures, which in conjunction with the use of water as a "green" extraction solvent lead to bioactive compounds stability and increased applicability of aqueous extracts. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16639					FSTA:2022-11-Aj21320
J		Ziang Zhang; Hong Lin; Jianxin Sui; Xiangning Han; Luefeng Wang; Xun Sun; Limin Cao							The effect of chlorophyll on the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of procymidone in vegetables and the way to overcome the matrix interference.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. There is now an increasing demand for the immunoassay of procymidone residue in foodstuffs. However, the matrix interference could significantly affect the analysis. Till now there is no detailed information on the source of the interference and the mechanism involved, which greatly limits the real application of these techniques. Results. Significant matrix effect was observed in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) of procymidone in negative vegetable samples (leek, broccoli and cucumber). By the investigation with both vegetable extracts and standard solutions, the chlorophyll was confirmed as an important source of the matrix effect. Therefore, a new strategy was proposed for the pretreatment based on the exploitation of 5-sulfosalicylic acid. It was demonstrated to effectively eliminate chlorophyll and exhibited little effect on procymidone and the competitive indirect ELISA (ci-ELISA) performance. The established technique was validated with different vegetables. With the spiking concentration of procymidone investigated, the recovery rate of ci-ELISA was 71.52-120.37%, and the relative standard deviation was 4.05-17.61%. Conclusion. Chlorophyll was for the first time illuminated as an important source of matrix interference to the immunoassay of procymidone in vegetables. A new pretreatment based on 5-sulfosalicylic acid was established to remove chlorophyll and therefore eliminate the matrix effect. Validated with different vegetable samples, the new technique was demonstrated much better efficiency in comparison to conventional methods, which indicated its promising application for the development of immunoassays of herb-origin samples. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	8	3393	3399	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11686					FSTA:2022-09-Jh12317

An investigation using a validated method based on HS-SPME-GC-MS detection for the determination of 2-dodecylcyclobutanone and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone in X-ray irradiated dairy products.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The headspace-solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS) technique was used to investigate 2-dodecylcyclobutanone (2-DCB) and 2-tetradecylcyclobutanone (2-TCB) as X-ray induced markers in irradiated dairy products. For the first time, an intensive study on several types of milk and cheeses, was carried out to evaluate both the suitability of this analytical technique for dairy products and how different factors related to these types of food, such as matrix composition, ripening time and technological processes, can affect 2-DCB and 2-TCB extraction. The results demonstrated that these analytes were identified in all types of irradiated samples, even if 2-TCB showed a lower sensibility than 2-DCB. Moreover, for both analytes, increasing irradiation dose over the experimental range of 0.5-5.0 kGy, a linear response was observed in all the matrices studied. The minimum dose level (MDL) and limit of detection (LOD), in irradiated and spiked samples, were 0.5 kGy and 5.0 mug L-1, respectively. Furthermore, linear correlation between 2-DCB and 2-TCB contents was demonstrated. Finally, chemometric analysis highlighted the influence of ripening time and dairy technological processes on extraction capability of the two investigated analytes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Association of carob galactomannans with probiotic bacteria in synbiotic fermented milk and colon targeted-release carrier.		International Food Research Journal					For the first time, this study presented the use of raw locust bean gum (LBG) as a prebiotic, with one probiotic strain in synbiotic fermented milk or combined with Na-alginate as a biopolymer, for a targeted release of bacteria under colon-like conditions. For this purpose, the fermentative characteristics (biomass, pH), bacterial survival, and developed viscosities of the stored fermented milks were determined. The survival rates of microencapsulated bacteria using the emulsion technique under simulated gastrointestinal conditions (stomach: pH 2 + 0.3% pepsin; colon: pH 6.5 + 1% pancreatin + 0.3% bile) were also evaluated. Results showed that all the tested bacteria maintained better biomass and acidifying activities in the presence of LBG, especially at 2%. During cold storage, the viscosities of the LBG-fermented milks were regulated and better appreciated, especially at 2%. Lactobacillus rhamnosus LbRE-LSAS and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis Bb12 microencapsulated separately in Ca-alginate-raw carob gum maintained good survival rates (51-66%) as compared to free cells (21-59%) under simulated digestive conditions, and were released under colon-like conditions. Therefore, the formulation of LBG-enriched fermented milks containing probiotic bacteria could represent a very good candidate for industrial application. Ca-alginate-raw LBG beads for the specific release of probiotics in the colon could benefit consumers with celiac disease or other digestive disorders because LBG is naturally gluten-free.										2022	29	4	879	891	1985-4668				10.47836/ifrj.29.4.15					FSTA:2023-01-Pl0202

Food Chemistry					Selenium (Se)-enriched green tea has been recognized as a possible source of supplemental Se, while the structural and physiological activities of Se-containing flavone are still unclear. In this study, a Se-containing flavone was isolated from Se-enriched green tea by high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) and characterized through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap, FT-IR and NMR. Results proved that HSeO3- can be combined with the alcohol hydroxyl of 2-phenylchromone in flavone and the content of Se-containing flavone in tea was 15690.4mug L-1. Additionally, Se-containing flavone can effectively inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO), and downregulate expression of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Compared with regular flavone extracted from green tea (43.24 pg mL-1), release of IL-10 was higher in Se-containing flavone group (53.37 pg mL-1), indicating that Se-containing flavone played an important role in the process of severe inflammatory injury. The results indicated that Se-containing flavone was an attractive natural ingredient for developing novel functional foods.

J		Zibian Fan; Wei Jia; An Du; Lin Shi							Pseudo-targeted metabolomics analysis of the therapeutic effect of phenolics-rich extract from Se-enriched green tea (Camellia sinensis) on LPS-stimulated murine macrophage (RAW264.7).		Food Research International					Selenium (Se)-enriched green tea (Se-Te) has been recognized as a possible source of Se supplements, while the effect of Se enrichment on function of polyphenols in green tea is still unclear. In this study, a pseudo-targeted metabolomics strategy was carried out to reveal the regulatory mechanism of polyphenols extracted from Se-Te and regular green tea (Re-Te) on inflammatory response at cellular level. A novel analysis strategy using UHPLC/ESI Q-Orbitrap combined with MS-IOP was applied to profile the dynamic changes of metabolites in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages during polyphenols incubation. A total of 128 characteristic variables (VIP > 1, p< 0.05) were screened in Se-Te group and the results of bioinformatics analysis and quantitative research indicated that in addition to the 6 conventional immune protective pathways involved in tea polyphenols, Se-enriched polyphenols were also participated in 3 unique antioxidant enzyme activation pathways, including phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, phenylalanine metabolism and pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis. The result of weight calculation based on topological analysis indicated that the promoting synthesis of antioxidant enzymes was the main mechanism of Se-Te polyphenols to inhibit inflammation. However, compared with Re-Te group, the intracellular B vitamin pathway in Se-Te group was disturbed, which is related to the fact that Se supplementation can promote the synthesis of selenoprotein and catalyze the reduction of thioredoxin by NADPH, thus blocking the signaling pathways of B vitamins. This study comprehensively explored the immune protective mechanism of polyphenols extracted from Se-Te and Re-Te under natural growth conditions, which could give a better understanding of the potential nutritional value of Se-Te as a widely used Se supplement.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Ligustilide (LIG) is a major active ingredient in traditional Chinese medicines that is also found in plant rhizomes such as carrot, coriander, and others, and it has been demonstrated to have cardiovascular preventive benefits. However, the mechanisms through which LIG protects the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems in atherosclerosis (AS) remain unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms of LIG in AS utilizing the network pharmacology and molecular docking, and then to validate the putative mechanism through experiments. The network pharmacological analysis indicated that a total of 55 were performed on LIG and AS intersection targets. The genes of LIG and AS intersection targets enriched in the regulation of receptor and enzyme activity, cytokines-related, and transcription factors, indicating that these targets were primarily involved in cell proliferation and migration, regulating cell differentiation and skeletal activities in the development of AS. Finally, molecular docking was used to validate the major targets of LIG and AS intersection targets. Further experiments revealed that LIG may inhibit cell migration induced by AngII by reducing calcium influx, and regulating phenotypic translation-related proteins SM-22alpha and OPN. The present study investigated the potential targets and signaling pathways of LIG, which provides new insight into its anti-atherosclerosis actions in terms of reducing inflammation, cell proliferation, and migration, and may constitute a novel target for the treatment of AS. Practical applications. LIG has been shown to have cardiovascular protective benefits, the mechanism by which it protects the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular systems in AS remains unknown. This study uses a holistic network pharmacology strategy to investigate putative treatment pathways and conducts exploratory experimentation. The findings demonstrate that LIG reduces VSMC migration in the treatment of AS, acts as an anti-inflammatory agent, and prevents excessive cell proliferation and migration. Finally, the goal of our research is to uncover the molecular mechanism of LIG's influence on AS. The findings will provide a new research avenue for LIG as well as suggestions for the study of other herbal treatments. These research results will provide a new research direction for LIG and provide guidance for the research of other herbal medicines. This work revealed the multi-component, multi-target, multi-pathway, and multi-disease mechanism of LIG. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14146					FSTA:2022-11-Jk14706

Food Chemistry					A novel and green one-step simultaneous extraction process of phycobiliproteins and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from wet Porphyridium biomass has been done and optimized by using three phase partitioning (TPP) process. Results showed that the coupling of ammonium sulfate and protein buoyancy-promoting t-butanol afforded the best TPP to extract phycobiliproteins and PUFAs in term of the extraction performance and cost-effectiveness. TPP process gave the best capability to simultaneously extract Porphyridium-derived phycobiliproteins and PUFAs in 20% ammonium sulfate, 0.5% biomass, and 1:0.5 slurry to t-butanol ratio at 100 rpm and 20°C for 10min of extraction time. Moreover, the established TPP system achieved excellent reproducibility in the extraction of Porphyridium biomass from different sources (Porphyridium cruentum and P. purpureum); and was successfully implemented in pilot-scale (20-L), indicating its industrial potential as a promising integrated approach to comprehensively exploit Porphyridium as a renewable bioresource for high-value bioproducts.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Torreya grandis seed oil, with a feature of Delta5-sciadonic acid (SA, 20:3 Delta5, 11, 14 omega-6), is an attractive woody oil as its potential health benefits in lowering blood and hepatic lipids and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, its oxidative stabilities at both room temperature and heating conditions were investigated by analysing oxidation stability index (OSI), shelf-life, changes of fatty acids, acid value and peroxide value during stir-frying tests. Also, its effects on the sensory qualities of stir-fried shredded potatoes were evaluated. The OSI of T. grandis seed oil was 2.97h at 120 °C, which was 11.24% higher than that of the control soybean oil, contributing to a longer predicted shelf-life of 135-195d for T. grandis seed oil than 127-180d for soybean oil. T. grandis seed oil also exhibited superior thermal stability compared to soybean oil. The feature fatty acid, SA, only lost 2.48-5.73% (decreasing from 14.14 to 13.33-13.79%) under the optimised stir-frying conditions at 140-180 °C for 3-5min. For the stir-frying shredded potatoes, T. grandis seed oil made it more pleasing in colour, odour and palatability. Due to its desirable oxidative stability at room temperature and stir-frying performance at high temperature, T. grandis seed oil is suitable for use as a domestic cooking oil. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	3	1836	1845	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15561					FSTA:2022-06-Ne1229

Structural morphology and rheological properties of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods subjected to cold plasma treatment.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Cold plasma (CP) is an innovative technology for non-thermal food processing. Low temperature and active particles during CP processing play a significant role in limiting nutrient loss in food and modifying biomacromolecules. So far, numerous works have been carried out on the use of CP in food processing. However, the effectiveness of the CP pre-extraction treatment on the structural morphology and rheological properties of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods is not described yet. Therefore, the study aimed to evaluate the effect of CP on the changes in structural morphology and rheological properties of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions extracted from okra pods. The yield of extraction depended on the type of solvent and the duration of CP treatment. The short CP treatment (5 s) caused the suspension of extraction, while longer treatments (15 and 30 s) contributed to the formation of microcracks on the surface of okra that favored efficient extraction yields. Pectins extracted from okra belonged to the group of the low methylated ones. The degree of methylation was<50%, and it depended on the solvent type but not on the treatment. WSP fraction was characterized by the highest viscosity, and it was followed by the viscosities of DASP and CSP.

Modification of the cell wall polysaccharides and phytochemicals of okra pods by cold plasma treatment.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of different processing times of cold plasma (CP) treatment on the cell wall polysaccharides and phytochemical properties of okra pods was investigated. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) spectra of water-soluble pectin (WSP), chelator-soluble pectin (CSP), and diluted alkali-soluble pectin (DASP) fractions isolated from okra pods subjected to different CP treatment times were analyzed by principal component analysis (PCA) and the results highlighted significant differences among different pectin fractions. The CP treatment caused a decrease in the contents of lycopene and chlorophyll alpha. However, the CP treatment with 30 s (CP30) resulted in a slight increase (4%) in the content of chlorophyll beta and led to the smallest color change of okra pods. The CP5, CP15, and CP30 slightly decreased the total phenolics (TP) content of okra pods by 5, 13, and 20%, respectively. The total flavonoids (TF) content of okra pods was not significantly affected by the CP. The short CP treatment, i.e. CP5, was found to be beneficial to the antioxidant potential of okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays. The antioxidant potentials of CP-treated okra pods determined by the FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS assays were positively correlated with TP contents (r = 0.53, r = 0.97, and r = 0.82, respectively) and TF contents (r = 0.92, r = 0.76, and r = 0.87, respectively). The results of this study provide a deep understanding and insight into non-thermal CP treatment and its influence on the properties of agro-food products and are useful for designing and optimizing non-thermal unit operations.

The effect of high humidity hot air impingement blanching on the changes in molecular and rheological characteristics of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods.		Food Hydrocolloids					The aim of study was to evaluate the changes in molecular and rheological characteristics of pectin fractions extracted from okra pods subjected to high-humidity hot air impingement blanching (HHAIB). HHAIB had pronounced impact on the pectin solubility of okra pods, their structure and rheology. For example, short HHAIB, i.e. 15 and 30 s, resulted in some microcracks on the surface of okra pods, while the longer ones, i.e. 60, 90 and 120 s, resulted in higher stress and teared the outer skin of okra pods. HHAIB for 15 and 30 s prevented extractability of pectins from okra pods and resulted in a decrease in yield. HHAIB for 60 s facilitated pectin extraction providing higher yields, while HHAIB for 90 and 120 s led to the extraction of non-pectin cell wall components as well. Molecules of pectins of okra pods have been characterized by different molecular size, shape, and branching that depended on both solvent used for extraction and the time of HHAIB treatment. Degradation, aggregation and transformation of molecules to more easy soluble fractions was observed during blanching treatment. A pick of consistency index and viscosity was observed for pectins extracted from okra pods subjected to HHAIB treatment for 30-60 s. HHAIB was found to be one of the heat treatment methods that may be suitable support for improving pectin extraction and useful in tailoring pectin properties for further applications.

The effect of high humidity hot air impingement blanching on the changes in cell wall polysaccharides and phytochemicals of okra pods.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Okra pods contain heat-sensitive substances, such as phenolic compounds and other phytochemicals that can be degraded when okra pods are subjected to heat treatment. The understanding of the impact of high humidity hot air impingement blanching (HHAIB) on the changes in physicochemical properties of polysaccharides and phytochemicals of okra pods is of great importance because over-blanching may result in cell membrane disruption and changes in biologically active compounds under prolonged exposure to the thermal treatment. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of HHAIB on the changes in physicochemical properties of pectins and phytochemicals extracted from okra pods. Results. Both the HHAIB time and method of extraction influenced their physicochemical characteristics and biological activity. Pectin fractions subjected to HHAIB were composed of polygalacturonic acid, rhamnogalacturonan, glucomannan, galactan, mannose, arabinose, rhamnose, calcium pectate and arabinogalactan. The contents of total phenolics, total flavonoids and antioxidant activity of extracts mostly increased during HHAIB (i.e.up to 19.0%, 13.2% and 35.3%, respectively). However, HHAIB reduced the chlorophyll-a (up to 55.7%) and lycopene (up to 52.6%) contents of okra pods. Conclusion. The acquired knowledge may be useful for better understanding and optimization of technologies based on HHAIB treatment. The HHAIB treated okra can be a promising natural alternative in different applications, including its use as a replacement of some ingredients in food or non-food systems as a result of richness in polysaccharides and polyphenols, as well as high antioxidant properties. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.

Food Chemistry					The concentration of aldehydes is one of the important indicators in the food quality and safety. To efficiently analyze the four aldehydes (methanal, ethanal, propanal and n-butanal) in beer, charged microdroplet driving online derivatization apparatus coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry was firstly developed. Utilizing the high-speed reaction accelerated by microdroplets, the offline derivative of aldehydes with 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in bulk was transferred into online derivatization. The developed method featured acceptable linearities (R2 ≥ 0.95), high sensitivities (LODs at ng mL-1 level) and qualified precisions (RSDs ≤ 8.4 %) for target compounds. Four aldehydes with trace amount were successfully determined in beer. The results indicated that the novel online analytical strategy did not require complex sample preparation and could conduct simple, rapid, sensitive detection of small molecule aldehydes with high throughput in beer or even other food samples.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					ACE inhibitory and antioxidant peptides from goat milk fermented by Lactiplantibacillus plantarum L60 and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus LR22 with Alcalase were optimized through Box-Behnken Design. The effects of enzyme addition, fermentation time, and temperature on DPPH free radical scavenging rate and ACE inhibition rate were studied. The optimum conditions are to add 0.15% enzyme and ferment at 37°C for 12 h, contributing to DPPH free radical scavenging rate of 75.17% and ACE inhibition rate of 84.15%. Compared with the control, it increased by 16.87% and 22.74%, respectively. The bioactive peptides below 3 KDa were obtained by ultrafiltration and identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The results demonstrated that both exist three identical peptides: FFDDK, NMAHIPR, SCQDQPTTLAR. There are eight identical peptides in goat milk fermented by two probiotics. This study will contribute to the production of functional fermented dairy products with high ACE inhibitory and antioxidant properties. Practical applications. ACE inhibitory and antioxidant peptides have the functions of relieving elevated blood pressure and scavenging free radicals in the body, respectively. In this study, the process of Alcalase-assisted two probiotics in fermentation was optimized, and ACE inhibition and DPPH free radical scavenging rate are significantly improved. There were three same peptides in five goat milk containing bioactive peptides and they mainly derived from whey protein and casein of goat milk, which indicates the enzymes produced by different probiotics have the same restriction sites. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16514					FSTA:2022-09-Pl4153

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Angiotensin convening enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides can inhibit ACE effectively, which is crucial to regulating blood pressure. Many studies on the production of ACE-inhibitory peptides by probiotics, but few works have been carried out on Directed-Vat-Set (DVS) starter producing ACE-inhibitory peptides. In the study, The DVS starter producing ACE-inhibitory peptides were optimized using Lactiplantibacillus plantarum L69 (L69) and starter with Lactobacillus bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus (Starter LS) through the single factor and the Box-Behnken design. The optimum conditions were: addition of DVS starter is 0.20%, which is composed of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum powder and starter in the ratio of 1:1, cultivation time of 4.5 hr, fermentation temperature 42°C, and the response value were pH of 4.63, optical density (OD) of 0.759, ACE-inhibition activity of 87.20% in fermented milk. The accelerated storage test demonstrated that the inactivation rate constant of the DVS starter was k-18 = 4.24 * 10-3 at -18°C, indicating good stability. Practical applications. ACE-inhibitory peptides have a significant antihypertensive effect and are safe without toxic side effects compared with ordinary antihypertensive drugs. In this study, Single-factor and Box-Behnken design were used to optimize the conditions of producing ACE-inhibitory peptides from DVS starter and the acceleration test was used to evaluate its stability. The fermentation time of DVS starter is shorter and the storage property is better. This study provided technical support for the development of DVS starter for functional dairy products. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16475					FSTA:2022-07-Pl3377

Food Chemistry					Multiple-layer coating technology has widely applied to the quality modification of bioactive ingredients nowadays. This research used a rotary side-spray fluid bed to manufacture chlorophyll multiple-layer particles to adjust control release characteristics. The chlorophyll extracts were coated with sodium alginate (A1) and sodium caseinate (CA1) as the primary layer on sugar spheres and the product yield was 96.98 and 96.71%, respectively. The content of chlorophyll a and b (mug/g) were 41.04 and 13.20 in A1, 47.40 and 13.68 in CA1. The Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed the bonding change and increase stability. The CA1 was coated with sodium alginate (CA-A), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CA-C) and xanthan gum (CA-X) as the secondary layer, which can increase coated integrity, shell strength and thermal stability. The simulated gastrointestinal fluid showed 30.11% release in the stomach and 94.27% in the intestine, which improved release control characteristics.

Food Chemistry					Trans fatty acids (TFAs), associated with the risks of coronary heart disease and diabetes, are formed by isomerization of unsaturated fatty acids during refining of linseed oils. In this study, TFAs and the chemical characteristics (acid value, peroxide value, carbonyl compounds, bioactive minor components and fatty acids) in 32 commercial linseed oils were investigated, and the correlation among them were further analyzed. Results showed that C18:3 TFAs were predominant TFAs in linseed oils and about 9% of the samples had TFA contents above 2 g/100 g fat, as well as the average level of TFA in the refined samples was higher than that in the unrefined oils. The correlation analyses suggested C18:3 TFAs exhibited significant negative correlations with acid value, levels of acetone, trans-2-nonenal, campesterol and alpha-linolenic acid. These results provided a comprehensive insight of TFAs in linseed oil and had important implications for consumers and linseed oil industry.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Soluble dietary fiber (SDF) obtained from Lentinula edodes byproducts has beneficial effects on human intestinal health. This study aimed to examine the combined preventive and ameliorative effects of a kind of synbiotic (SDF with a molecular weight of 1.58 * 102kDa and Lactobacillus plantarum LP90 (LP) at 1 * 109CFUkg-1) on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis mice. Results. The results demonstrated that synbiotic treatment could alleviate weight loss, decrease the disease activity index level and cause histological amelioration. Synbiotic treatment also promoted the production of goblet cells, increased the expression of tight junction proteins, and adjusted the production of myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde and superoxide dismutase to repair intestinal epithelial injury. Clinical symptoms were alleviated by maintaining Th17/Treg balance, increasing interleukin 10 and immunoglobulin A levels, reducing interleukin 17a and tumor necrosis factor alpha production, and promoting mRNA to highly express of Foxp3 and vitamin D receptors. Moreover, synbiotic treatment could upregulate butyric acid production (4.71 0.46molg-1 feces, P<0.05) and diversity of intestinal microbial to maintain intestinal homeostasis. Conclusion. This study suggested that the combination of LP and SDF as a synbiotic has the potential for use as a nutritional supplement to alleviate colitis. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	103	2	616	626	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12173					FSTA:2023-03-Jq5605

Food & Function					Food-grade isomaltulose exhibits significant modulation of gut microbiota and its metabolites in healthy populations. This study further explored the preventive therapeutic effect and anti-colitis potential of isomaltulose on dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis in mice. Our results suggested that isomaltulose played a significant role in preventing colon shortening, reducing intestinal epithelial destruction and inhibiting inflammatory cell infiltration. Meanwhile, the isomaltulose supplement greatly reduced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and restored the balance between T helper type 17 (Th17) cells and regulatory T (Treg) cells. Pathway enrichment analysis for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) also indicated that the anti-inflammatory effect of isomaltulose was closely related to intestinal immunity. Moreover, the disturbed gut microbiota in ulcerative colitis (UC) was partially restored after treatment with isomaltulose. These results suggest that isomaltulose is a promising therapeutic agent for the prevention and adjunctive treatment of UC by maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis and remodeling the gut microbiota. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	16	8572	8584	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo01157c					FSTA:2022-12-Aj22608

Food Hydrocolloids					Although gelatin-based composite gels have been widely used in the food and pharmaceutical industries, further research is needed to improve gel strength. This work reported the microstructure and gel properties of gelatin-based composite gels containing different contents of kappa-carrageenan (CGN) or konjac glucomannan (KGM). The rheological and textural results revealed that the gelling temperature, melting temperature, strength (from 1.68 to 4.13 times), toughness, and chewiness of the composite gel were positively correlated with the addition of CGN. The microscopy and infrared spectroscopy showed that gelatin and CGN molecules could be clustered in helices by electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding to form excellent gel networks with outstanding gelation properties. However, gelatin and KGM could either be compatible with or separated from each other. At a low KGM content, the gelatin-based composite gel was porous and had a dense gel structure. When the KGM content was 0.3%, the composite gel showed greater ordering degree. Thus, the addition of the proper amount of CGN to gelatin led to composite gels with better strength, toughness, and chewiness, whereas the addition of KGM generated gels being easy to chew and swallow.

Food Chemistry					Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa is recognized as a potential sustainable protein material in food industry, however, its application remains still very limited. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the antioxidative properties of Auxenochlorella pyrenoidosa protein hydrolysates and identify novel antioxidative peptides from protein hydrolysates through a workflow mainly including enzymatic hydrolysis, peptidome quantification, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling, in silico screening, and validation. Three novel antioxidative peptides including AGWACLVG, IDLAY and YPLDL were identified from protein hydrolysates by papain with the hydrolysis time of 4 h, in which, AGWACLVG showed strong 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity with the IC50 value of 68.88 M and Trolox equivalent antioxidative capacity of 6.200.23 mmol TE/g.

Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effect of dry heat on the aggregation characteristics of egg white protein (EWP) solutions. Turbidity and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) results showed that dry heat hindered the subsequent bulk aggregation of dry heated EWP (DEWP) in aqueous solutions. A similar trend was also found in the particle size distribution of DEWP aggregates, where longer dry heating times resulted in smaller size distributions. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations showed that native EWP tended to form bulk aggregates when heated in aqueous solutions, while DEWP aggregates presented linear and chain-like morphology. The alpha-helices of DEWP aggregates were converted to beta-sheets, and more chromogenic amino acids and hydrophobic groups were exposed owing to dry heat. Heat-induced aggregation of DEWP in water is more intense than that induced only by dry heat, but the hydrothermal aggregates with longer dry heating times were smaller in size and molecular weight.

Effect of processing on polyphenols in butternut pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata).		Food Bioscience					Pumpkin (Cucurbita moschata) is consumed worldwide with a diverse array of phytochemicals, including phenolics, that have therapeutic properties such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, and neuroprotective effects. Nevertheless, detailed information on polyphenol content in pumpkin processing is still limited. Therefore, the present work aimed to investigate the changes in polyphenol content and their antioxidant potential during pumpkin processing, followed by their comprehensive characterization and quantification using liquid chromatography electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC-PDA). The antioxidant results showed that pumpkins' seeds and skins (PSS) contained the highest total phenolic content (TPC, 0.39mg gallic acid equivalent mg/g) and total antioxidant capacity (TAC, 0.35mg ascorbic acid equivalent mg/g), respectively. However, separated pumpkin puree (SPP) had a higher total condensed tannins content (TCT, 0.15mg catechin equivalent mg/g). The LC-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS tentatively identified a total of 23 phenolic compounds present in the five pumpkin samples. Through HPLC-PDA quantification, the most abundant phenolic compounds were epicatechin (6.645mug/g) and catechin (6.146mug/g) detected in PSS. The comprehensive characterization and quantification of phenolics in processed pumpkins indicate the importance of pumpkins as a promising source of polyphenols with antioxidant properties. This study provides supportive information on the utilization of pumpkin phenolics in the food, pharmacological, and nutraceutical industries.

Food Research International					The present study aimed to enhance the bioaccessibility of hydrophobic astaxanthin (AST) by developing food-grade emulsion systems. Ovalbumin (OVA) fibrils and candelilla wax-based oleogels were prepared for the next fabrication of AST-loaded oleogel-based Pickering emulsions. The food-grade oleogel was obtained by mixing 0.7% (w/w) candelilla wax and soybean oil. The nano-scale OVA fibrils were observed by transmission electron microscope. SDS-PAGE analysis of OVA fibrils displayed the appearance of peptides with molecular weight around 10 kDa. Contact angle measurement indicated that excellent amphiphilicity endowed OVA fibrils with satisfactory Pickering emulsifier performance. The obtained oleogel-based Pickering emulsions displayed ultrastability during 90-day storage and outstanding freeze-thaw stability. Furthermore, the superiority of AST-loaded oleogel-based Pickering emulsion was further reflected in the apparently ameliorative lipolysis extent and AST bioaccessibility compared with oleogel. This work would facilitate the utilization of OVA and the development of oleogel-based Pickering emulsions with desirable nutraceutical bioaccessibility.

J		Zijian Liang; Veronica, V.; Jiehe Huang; Pangzhen Zhang; Zhongxiang Fang							Combined effects of plant food processing by-products and high oxygen modified atmosphere packaging on the storage stability of beef patties.		Food Control					Plant food processing by-products (PFPB) have attracted industrial attention as a potential source of natural antioxidants that can be used in meat industry. This study investigated the combined effects of PFPB including sugarcane bagasse (SCF), orange peel (ORP) and tomato pomace (TMT), and high oxygen modified atmosphere packaging (HOMAP; 80 % O2: 20 % CO2) on the oxidative and microbial stability of beef patties during cold storage for up to 12 days. The total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity of the PFPB were also evaluated. ORP was found to have the highest TPC, followed by TMT and SCF. DPPH-radical and ABTS-radical assays demonstrated a similar trend. The PFPB were proved to successfully improve the meat properties of a* value and total viable count (TVC) and minimize lipid and protein oxidation, although the effectiveness did not exceed that of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The HOMAP maintained the redness of beef patties and inhibited microbial growth compared to aerobic packaging, but did not improve lipid and protein oxidative stability. Overall, the combination of HOMAP and natural antioxidants from sugarcane, tomato and orange by-products can potentially improve the shelf life of beef patties by reducing oxidative deterioration of color, lipid and protein and delaying the growth of microorganisms. This research provided a reference for the future utilization of PFPB in meat preservation.

Food Chemistry					Pea protein-based delivery systems have drawn much attention in the food and pharmaceutical fields in recent years. However, its broad application faces great limitations because of the low solubility. Here, we present a novel and effective approach to overcome this difficulty and enhance the techno-functional characteristics, especially emulsifying stability, of the pea protein isolate (PPI). By combining pH-shifting with ultrasound and heating (PUH), we concluded that the solubility of PPI greatly increased from 29.5 % to 90.4 %, whereas its surface hydrophobicity increased from 1098 to 3706. This was accompanied by the changes of PPI structure, as shown by circular dichroism and scanning electron microscopy. In addition, the modified PPI was applied to stabilize sunflower oil-in-water emulsions. The droplet size of the emulsion with PUHP was reduced and its emulsion stability was significantly elevated. Taken together, we propose a novel combined approach to prepare modified PPI with high solubility and emulsion stability. We expect our method will have a wider application in modifying plant proteins and improving their industrial processing.

With the prolongation of processing time, the ZnPP content increased significantly, while the heme content decreased significantly. Compound curing agent significantly inhibited the formation of ZnPP and significantly decreased the heme content. The bacterial communities changed dynamically and the five bacterial genera were significantly positively correlated with ZnPP content. Forty-seven differential metabolites were obtained through screening, of which seventeen differential metabolites were significantly positively correlated with ZnPP content. Correlation analysis showed a strongly positive correlation between Staphylococcus, Delftia, Acinetobacter and these seventeen differential metabolites. These findings can provide a theoretical basis for further establishing the color control measures of Nuodeng ham.

J		Zijie Lin; Xiaojie Qin; Jing Li; Zohaib Aslam, M.; Tianmei Sun; Zhuosi Li; Xiang Wang; Qingli Dong							Machine learning approach for predicting single cell lag time of Salmonella Enteritidis after heat and chlorine treatment.		Food Research International					The importance of single-cell variability is increasingly prominent with the developments in foodborne pathogens modeling. Traditional predictive microbiology model cannot accurately describe the growth behavior of small numbers of cells due to individual cell heterogeneity. The objective of the present study was to develop predictive models for single cell lag times of Salmonella Enteritidis after heat and chlorine treatment. A time-lapse microscopy method was employed to evaluate the single cell lag time by monitoring cell divisions. Four supervised machine learning algorithms including gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF), and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and compared. Results show that all four machine learning models have good predictive capabilities without an overfitting of the data. The ANN approach demonstrated superior prediction performance over other machine learning models (RMSE: 0.209, MAE: 0.135 and R2: 0.989). Furthermore, the SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) measures were used to capture the influence of each feature on the model output, and results revealed that population lag times and sublethal injury rate have dominant impacts on the single cell lag time. Consequently, the findings generated from this study may be useful in managing the potential food safety risk caused by single cells of foodborne pathogens.

J		Zijie Wang; Yuying Yuan; Yaxian Liu; Menglei Zhang; Xiao Hua							Modification on the length of glucosyl chain in glucosyl steviol glycosides and its effect on product taste quality.		European Food Research and Technology					The taste quality of steviol glycosides (SG) is highly dependent on the numbers and linkages of glucosyl units connecting to its diterpenoid core. In this work, the transglycosylation of stevioside (ST) catalyzed by cyclodextrin glucanotransferase were optimized initially. At a high conversion rate of~65%, a mixture of ST derivatives was produced by adding 1-6glucosyl units to the ST molecule. By further treatment with alpha-glucosidase for 4-24 h, the length of the glucosyl chain can be reduced to 1-2 units. Based on a previous investigation, the SG recovered from the mother liquor of stevia production was used as the substrate. Taste quality evaluation on the obtained glucosyl steviol glycosides (GSG) suggested both the sweet and bitter aftertaste were significantly weakened after transglycosylation. The sweetness of GSG was obviously reduced with the increase in glucosyl-chain length, while the licorice flavor caused by the residual polyphenols can also be weakened after enzymatic modification. The GSG products presented unique taste quality different from rebaudioside A (RA) and rebaudioside M (RM), while their overall taste quality was close to that of RM. Conclusively, the research can provide a clean approach to promote the resource utilization of stevia, and new GSG products with improved taste quality can be the potential sweetener for food manufacture. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	7	1703	1713	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-03997-x					FSTA:2022-10-Tb3881

J.; Jian Li; Zhongyan Wang; Shiying Huang; Mingjing Zheng; Linfan Shi; Shanggui Deng; Shen Yang							Synergistic antibacterial effects of low-intensity ultrasound and peptide LCMHC against Staphylococcus aureus.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The increasing demand for ready-to-eat fresh foods requires the use of non-thermal sterilization, hence, the application of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) combined with ultrasound could serve as a novel food preservation method to prevent foodborne diseases. In this study, in silico tools were used to predict and screen potential AMPs from the antimicrobial amino acid sequence of myosin heavy chain of Larimichthys crocea. A novel AMP, designated as LCMHC, had strong antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus when combined with low-intensity ultrasound treatment. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of LCMHC was 125 mug/mL when used alone but 31.25 mug/mL when combined with 0.3 W/cm2 ultrasound treatment. Structural analysis using circular dichroism (CD) revealed that peptide LCMHC has alpha-helical structure, which had slightly untwisting effect with increasing ultrasonic intensity. Transmission electron microscopy and permeability analysis of bacteria cell membrane showed that low-intensity ultrasound combined with peptide LCMHC could greatly improve the cell membrane permeability of S. aureus. Moreover, low intensity-ultrasound could assist the entry of more peptide LCMHC into bacterial cells to bind DNA. The findings here provide new insight into the potential application of peptide LCMHC combined with low-intensity ultrasound in the food industry.

J		Zijing Wu; Chenxi Huang; Yongzhen Dong; Binjie Zhao; Yiping Chen							Gold core @ platinum shell nanozyme-mediated magnetic relaxation switching DNA sensor for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in chicken samples.		Food Control					Herein, an Au@Pt nanozyme-mediated magnetic relaxation switching (MRS) DNA biosensor has been developed for the rapid detection of Listeria monocytogenes. Au@Pt nanoparticle was with enhanced stability and high peroxidase activity for decomposing the hydrogen peroxide. After DNA hybridization and magnetic separation, the conjugates of MNP180-probe1-L. monocytogenes DNA-probe2-Au@Pt could adjust the hydrogen peroxide-mediated Mn (VII)/Mn (II) conversion, and thus leading to the change of the transverse relaxation time. The amount of Au@Pt was directly proportional to the concentration of L. monocytogenes. The Au@Pt nanozyme and the hydrogen peroxide-mediated Mn (VII)/Mn (II) signal conversion system contributed to the sensitivity and stability of this sensor. This sensor enabled the detection of L. monocytogenes with a LOD of 30 CFU/mL, which was 33-folds enhancement compared with that of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, providing a promising platform to trace the foodborne pathogen in the complex food matrix.

J		Zijuan Yu; Dawei Yu; Junli Dong; Wenshui Xia							Ultrasound-reinforced encapsulation of proanthocyanidin by chitosan-chondroitin sulfate nanosystem.		Food Hydrocolloids					The polyelectrolyte complexation between chitosan (CH) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) and the ultrasonication assistance were adopted as the encapsulation strategy for preparing proanthocyanidin (PC) encapsulated nanoparticles (NPs) to protect bio-functions of PC. Conditions of 1.5mg/mL of CH and CS, 1:3 wt ratio of CH/CS, 0.5mg/mL of PC, pH 3.25, and 1min ultrasonic treatment were recommended by the systematic research, respectively, with NPs appearing the smallest size (~300 nm) and high entrapment efficiency (37.5%). Ultrasound crushed aggregates into nanoparticles by the acoustic cavitation and generated more amide bonds observed by XPS. Due to the physical barrier of NPs, PC in NPs still had a 94.4% DPPH radical scavenging rate after illumination of 10 d. Application of NPs for fabricating CH bio-films was carried out, and the bio-films containing CH/CS-PC NPs decreased aerobic bacteria count and lipid oxidation of fillets stored for 8 d by 2.2 log10 CFU/g and 51.1%, respectively, which was better than pure CH bio-films. The incorporation of PC-encapsulated NPs to CH bio-films inhibited the bacteria and oxidation induced spoilage for refrigerated grass carp flesh, providing a potential application for food preservation.

J		Zijuan Yu; Qinbo Jiang; Dawei Yu; Junli Dong; Yanshun Xu; Wenshui Xia							Physical, antioxidant, and preservation properties of chitosan film doped with proanthocyanidins-loaded nanoparticles.		Food Hydrocolloids					The nanoparticles (NPs) loading with proanthocyanidins (PC), obtained by crosslinking of chitosan (CH) and chondroitin sulfate (CS), were used as nanofillers in the matrix of the neat CH film, designing a novel edible bioactive packaging film. The electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bonding between NPs and the CH film matrix made the film denser, greatly enhancing the mechanical strength and barrier ability of the film. Moreover, NPs significantly improved antioxidability of the film and weakened the damage of ultraviolet rays and thermal effects on the biological activities of PC. The positive synergistic effect between the CH film matrix and NPs was established to effectively inhibit Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and fish-original spoilage bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Aeromonas hydrophila). In general, the addition of PC-loaded NPs to the CH film endowed the film with stronger antioxidant, antibacterial, and oxygen barrier effects, and could effectively slow down the quality deterioration of refrigerated grass carp fillets during storage, such as lower accumulation of total volatile base nitrogen and biogenic amines (putrescine, cadaverine, etc.) and more stable texture characteristics when compared to the control, confirming the potential in the application of food active packaging film.

Food Science & Nutrition					The objective of this study was to investigate the changes of the proteins in bovine milk serum after retort processing by label-free quantification proteomics techniques. A total of 96 and 106 proteins were quantified in control group (CG) and retort group (RG), respectively. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the identified milk serum proteins showed a decrease in the abundance of most proteins, such as serum albumin, lactoperoxidase, lactotransferrin, and complement C3, and an increase in the abundance of other proteins such as kappa-casein, lipocalin 2, and Perilipin. Student's t-test showed 21 proteins significantly differential abundance between CG and RG (p<.05), of which intensity-based absolute quantification (iBAQ) of five proteins decreased and iBAQ of 16 proteins increased. Bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that retort processing increased the digestibility of proteins, but this improvement was offset by a decrease in the digestibility of proteins caused by protein modification. Our results provide insight into the proteome of retort sterilized milk for the first time. Given the extremely high security of retort sterilized milk, the proteome of bovine milk serum changes after retort sterilization exposed in this study will contribute to the formula design of retort sterilized milk products. © 2021 The Authors.

J.; Mei Shi; Zhaohui Wang							Synchrotron X-ray fluorescence technique identifies contribution of node iron and zinc accumulations to the grain of wheat.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Increasing iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in crop grains with high yield is an effective measure to ensure food supply and alleviate mineral malnutrition in humans. Micronutrient concentrations in grains depend on not only their availability in soils but also their uptake in roots and translocation to shoots and grains. In this three-year field study, we investigated genotypic variation in Fe and Zn uptake and translocation within six wheat cultivars and examined in detail Fe and Zn distributions in various tissues of two cultivars with similar high yield but different grain Fe and Zn concentrations using synchrotron micro-X-ray fluorescence. Results revealed that root Fe and Zn concentrations were 11 and 44% greater in high-nutrient (HN) than in low-nutrient (LN) concentration cultivar. Although both cultivars accumulated similar amounts of Fe in shoots, HN cultivar had greater accumulation of Fe in grain and greater accumulation of Zn in both shoots and grain. Grain Zn concentration was positively correlated with shoot Zn accumulation, and grain Fe concentration was positively correlated with the ability to translocate Fe from leaves/stem to grains. In the first nodes of shoots, HN cultivar had 482% greater Fe and 36% greater Zn concentrations in the enlarged vascular bundle (EVB) than LN cultivar. In top nodes, HN cultivar had 225 and 116% greater Fe and Zn concentrations in the transit vascular bundle and 77 and 71% greater in the EVB when compared to LN cultivar. HN cultivar also had a greater ability to allocate Fe and Zn to the grain than LN cultivar. In conclusion, HN cultivar had greater capacity of Fe and Zn acquirement by roots and translocation and partitioning from shoots into grains. Screening wheat cultivars for larger Fe and Zn concentrations in shoot nodes could be a novel strategy for breeding crops with greater grain Fe and Zn concentrations.										2022	70	30	9346	9355	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c02561					FSTA:2022-12-Mj6931

Ergogenic property of Morinda citrifolia L. leaf extract affects energy metabolism in obese Sprague Dawley rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Ergogenic property is the ability to enhance capacity for physical activities through efficient production of energy and is potentially beneficial in weight management for the obese. In this study, ergogenic property of Morinda citrifolia leaf's extract (MCL) was evaluated using AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity and high fat diet-induced obese rats. Findings from the study showed that MCL demonstrated ergogenic activity via enhancement of AMPK activity using L6 skeletal muscle cell line. Interestingly, the result also revealed that rats treated with the intermediate dosage of MCL experienced the lowest% weight gain. The rats fed the highest dose of 200 mg/kg BW MCL demonstrated the longest swimming time of approximately three times that of green tea and caffeine-fed rats. The highest dose fed rats were also found to have lower glucose and lactate levels, suggesting that energy metabolism was more effective in these rats. In addition, lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase activities, the muscle injury indicators, were found to be the lowest in rats fed the highest MCL dose. The same effect was not seen in rats fed either caffeine or green tea, indicating that MCL treatment is may be protective of the rats' muscles. It was also shown that MCL consisted of various flavonoids with epicatechin, catechin, and quercetin that may be responsible for the effects measured. In conclusion, improvements were seen in rats fed MCL in terms of weight management, endurance capacity, energy metabolism, and muscle injury parameters. Practical applications. Results of the study revealed that Morinda citrifolia leaf has great potential to be used as functional ingredient in the development of designer food/drink as ergogenic aid for both obese and non-obese individuals. Morinda citrifolia leaf could help in the weight management of obese people and enhance endurance capacity and energy metabolism in active individuals. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14027					FSTA:2022-04-Ge1967
J		Ziliang Huang; Rujing Wang; Qiong Zhou; Yue Teng; Shijian Zheng; Liu Liu; Liusan Wang							Fast location and segmentation of high-throughput damaged soybean seeds with invertible neural networks.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Fast identification of damaged soybean seeds has undeniable importance in seed sorting and food quality. Mechanical vibration is generally used in soybean seed sorting, but this can seriously damage soybean seeds. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is considered an effective method for location and segmentation tasks. However, a CNN requires a large amount of ground truth data and has high computational cost. Results. First, we propose a self-supervision manner to automatically generate ground truths, which can theoretically create an almost unlimited number of labeled images. Second, instead of using popular CNNs, a novel invertible convolution (involution)-enabled scheme is proposed by using the bottleneck block of the residual networks. Third, a feature selection feature pyramid network (FS-FPN) based on involution is designed, which selects features more flexibly and adaptively. We further merge involution-based backbones and FS-FPN into a unified network, achieving an end-to-end seed location and segmentation model; the best mean average precision of location and segmentation achieved was 85.1% and 81% respectively. Conclusion. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method greatly improves the performance of the baseline network with faster speed and fewer parameters, enabling it to detect soybean seeds more effectively. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4854	4865	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11848					FSTA:2022-11-Jn15140

Food Bioscience					Brassica rapa L. is an edible and medical plant in China used for treating various diseases, especially in the Tibet region. In this study, the chemical constituents of Brassica rapa L. extract (BE) was clarified by UHPLC-MS and anti-fatigue ability of BE was assessed through the behavior test and weight-loaded forced swimming test in mice. Then we determined several biochemical parameters related to fatigue to explore possible reasons. Results. Indicate that BE could significantly enhance exercise performance in mice, and there was a significant improvement in both grip-strength and the time on rota-rods. Meanwhile, BE showed significant anti-fatigue effects by decreasing the blood lactic acid (BLA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatine kinase (CK) levels and increasing the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Increases in superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were observed and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels was regulated. Liver and muscle glycogen levels and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels were also significantly increased. Pearson correlation analysis indicates that fatigue-related indexes including metabolites and energy-related indexes were significantly correlated with antioxidant levels. In conclusion, BE possesses remarkable anti-fatigue activity, thereby shows great potential for improving exercise performance and alleviating physical fatigue and can be considered as a functional food supplement for further development.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The excessive intake of caffeine might adversely affect health, so decaffeinated food becomes a hot topic for investigation. Penicillium simplicissimum 4-17 was inoculated into sun-dried green tea for the pile fermentation (QZTWP) at a pilot scale to develop decaffeinated Qingzhuan tea (QZT). Through comparisons in chemical compositions, fungal community structure and sensory qualities, the results showed that after 21-d pile fermentation, most quality components in QZTWP were same or similar to those in naturally fermented QZT, except caffeine. Caffeine decreased nearly 50%, and some quality components were better in QZTWP than those in naturally fermented QZT. The addition of P. simplicissimum 4-17 couldn't change the dominant strains in the pile fermentation of QZT, but was conducive to increasing the amount of Saccharomyces, Candida, and Penicillium and to inhibiting the unfavorable strains. The results confirmed that P. simplicissimum 4-17 not only contributed high caffeine degradation ability of pilot fermentation of QZT, but also helped to improve the comprehensive quality of QZT. It means that there is a great potential of P. simplicissimum 4-17 for industrial production of decaffeinated QZT.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The effects of hot air (HA) pretreatment on quality, phenolic accumulation and antioxidant activity of fresh-cut pitaya fruit were investigated. It was found that 42°C HA pretreatment for 3 h effectively alleviated the browning of fresh-cut pitaya fruit stored at both 4°C for 14 d and 20°C for 48 h. To better understand the physiological mechanisms of HA on browning alleviation, higher storage temperature at 20°C was used to accelerate and amplify the wounding responses. The results demonstrated that HA pretreatment delayed the wound induced biosynthesis of phenolic compounds of fresh-cut pitaya fruit during earlier storage period but enhanced their contents and maintained higher antioxidant activity during the later stage of storage. It retarded but enhanced the activation of key enzymes (PAL, 4CL and C4H) and their relative gene expressions involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. Moreover, HA pretreatment suppressed the activities of enzymes associated with oxidative browning of phenolics (PPO and POD), activated ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle and inhibited the wound induced proliferation of ROS production which could cause oxidative damage of fresh-cut pitaya fruit. These findings suggested that pretreatment with HA could be an efficient and feasible approach for the browning alleviation and quality retention of fresh-cut pitaya fruit, and the phenylpropanoid metabolism and AsA-GSH cycle played crucial roles in this process.

J		Ziman Hu; Miao Shao; Bin Zhang; Xiong Fu; Qiang Huang							Enhanced stability and controlled release of menthol using a beta-cyclodextrin metal-organic framework.		Food Chemistry					Menthol inclusion complexes (ICs) have addressed a range of opportunities in food applications due to their volatile resistance. However, previous protocols used for their synthesis give low yields and high industrial application costs. In the present investigation, metal-organic frameworks based on beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD-MOF) have been prepared for the molecular encapsulation of menthol. Menthol/beta-CD-MOF-IC was synthesized under the optimized parameters, after which release behavior was studied. In this optimized manner, a higher menthol capacity was obtained in which the menthol content and encapsulation efficiency were 27.1 and 30.6%, respectively. Compared with menthol/beta-CD-IC, menthol/beta-CD-MOF-IC is resistant to high temperature, but sensitive to moisture. In a simulated oral release experiment, the rate of menthol release from different samples followed the order of: pure menthol > beta-CD > beta-CD-MOF, which can be attributed to two mechanisms: non-specific binding and site preference. We propose that beta-CD-MOF can be used as a promising delivery system for aroma compounds.

Food Chemistry					The optimum supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) extraction of fermented soybean lipids (FSE-C) was as follows: 35 °C, 30 MPa, and 2.40 0.19% moisture content using response surface methodology. The fatty acid composition of FSE-C contained more palmitic acid and alpha-linolenic acid and less linoleic acid than unfermented soybean lipids (SE-C). FSE-C had higher contents of minor active components (phytosterols, squalene, total flavonoid, and total polyphenol) than SE-C. The protective effects of FSE-C on erastin-induced ferroptosis were investigated to reveal the potential mechanisms of action characterized by increasing cell viability and glutathione concentrations, attenuating levels of intracellular Fe2+ ion, lipid peroxidation, and ROS, as well as modifying mRNA expression (GPx4, SLC7A11, ACSL4, and LPCAT3) and lipid metabolism. These findings suggest that FSE-C is a class of active ingredients against erastin-induced ferroptosis and warrants further exploration and utilization as a functional food.

Food Chemistry					Seabuckthorn extract is rich in bioactive compounds and well known for its health benefits. The study investigated the effect of seabuckthorn leaf extract on browning of fresh-cut potatoes. The results showed that seabuckthorn leaf extract significantly inhibited the browning of fresh-cut potatoes compared with seabuckthorn fruit extract. Catechin, hypericin, gallic acid, casuarinin and isorhamnetin were main components in seabuckthorn leaf extract. Further research revealed that seabuckthorn leaf extract competitively inhibited polyphenol oxidase (PPO) with IC50 value of 0.7mg/mL. Molecular docking indicated that gallic acid stably bound to the active site of PPO, while isorhamnetin had low affinity on PPO. These results also demonstrated that seabuckthorn leaf extract inhibited browning of fresh-cut potatoes by reducing activities of peroxidase and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, decreasing contents of phenolics and elevating antioxidant capacity. In addition, synergistic anti-browning effect was found with casuarinin, isorhamnetin, gallic acid and pedunculagin.

Food Bioscience					Microorganisms played a key role in developing the flavor quality, while few studies focused on the relationship between microbial diversity and flavor quality of dry-cured boneless ham. To explore the relationship, sensory evaluation, lipases, microorganism communities, free fatty acids and volatile compounds were investigated in dry-cured boneless ham with different quality grades (NS, WS and GS groups); the correlation between cored microbes and crucial volatiles was further evaluated by metabolic network analysis. GS group showed the highest scores in aroma and overall acceptance among three groups. The highest values of phospholipase activities (7.88 U*g-1 protein) were shown in GS group, while the lowest values of TBARS (0.93mg/kg) were observed in GS among three groups. High-throughput sequencing revealed that fungi showed the most various among three groups; Xerochrysium, Aspergillus, Penicillium and Debaryomyces were the most genera in GS. SPME-GC-MS revealed that GS showed higher contents and numbers in volatiles than other groups; aldehydes and furans were intensely response to the variations of volatiles among these groups. Metabolic pathway further revealed that several key species derived from Penicillium and Aspergillus accelerated the formation of volatiles by beta-lipoxidation and Strecker degradation. These results indicated that molds could be the major contributors in developing and differentiating the flavor quality of Chinese dry-cured boneless ham.

Journal of Functional Foods					Cardamine violifolia polysaccharide (CVP) has been studied mainly for structural analysis and in vitro activity. The present study showed that CVP supplementation was effective in enhancing the production of N-Oleoylethanolamin and improving the content of campesterol and stigmasterol in the Steroid biosynthesis-Mus musculus metabolic pathway. The genus levels of Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 genus, Lactobacillus genus, were significantly increased in the intestine of mice after CVP infusion. Importantly, CVP had a protective effect on the intestinal microbiota of mice, which may result from the increase in short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria of the genera Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillus. The therapeutic effect of CVP in STZ-induced type 2 diabetic mice may be achieved by modulating the structure of the intestinal microbiota and regulating the Steroid biosynthesis-Mus musculus metabolic pathway, and CVP is expected to be a potential food for the treatment and prevention of type 2 diabetes.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					With the benefits of high temperature and short time treatment, microwave irradiation has conquered novel extraction technology to valorize food wastes. In this study, the extraction processes of bioactive compounds from beetroot peel were accomplished by a home-use microwave oven following the central composite design performed by R statistical software. Aside from peel, stalk and flesh were utilized for bioactive compounds extraction as a comparison under three different processing conditions. Concerning the control (extracted conventionally), superior amounts of betalains, phenolics, flavonoids, and the relevant antioxidants were scavenged at 800 W of microwave power together with 150 s of extraction period following the descending order: peel, flesh, and stalk. Their respective extraction yield percentages are 9.14% (peel), 11.37% (stalk), and 14.99% (flesh). Ultimately, our observation is a prove of the high extraction efficiency of the pure water solvent.

J		Zini, S.; Mouhanni, H.; Besombes, C.							Effect of Argan oil, thyme, and rosemary on the drying process of Sardina Pilchardus fillets.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This work aims to study the drying kinetics of sardine fillets marinated with Argan oil, thyme, and rosemary at 70°C via the hybrid solar dryer. The static gravimetric method has been used to determine the sorption isotherms at 50, 60, and 70°C. Histamine content, TVBN, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and pH levels were analyzed as well. Finally, a statistical analysis of the results was accomplished using PCA. The sardine drying kinetics was accelerated with increasing air temperature in a synchronous manner. The optimal water activity for the conservation of sardines is aw = 0.32. The results obtained have led to an increase in the shelf life of sardine fillets marinated and dried on the basis of argan oil and thyme, unlike the product with argan oil, rosemary, and without marinade that will be destroyed in a few weeks. The findings results be explained by the antioxidant activity of thyme. Novelty impact statement. The drying kinetics of sardine fillets was determined experimentally, as well as the characteristic drying curve. Determination of the optimum water activity for the conservation of sardines is aw = 0.32. The combination of marine products with argan oil and thyme provides the longest preservation period while also adding a new quality and taste dimension to sardine conservation. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16628					FSTA:2022-11-Rc4724

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Dietary isothiocyanates (ITCs) from cruciferous vegetables have shown potent anti-breast cancer activities in preclinical models, but their anticancer effects in vivo in breast cancer patients remain elusive. A proof-of-principle, presurgical window of opportunity trial is conducted to assess the anticancer effects of dietary ITCs in breast cancer patients. Methods and Results. Thirty postmenopausal breast cancer patients are randomly assigned to receive ITC-rich broccoli sprout extract (BSE) (200 mol ITC per day) or a placebo for 2 weeks. Expression of biomarkers related to ITCs functions are measured in breast cancer tissue specimens at pre-and post-interventions using immunohistochemistry staining. First morning urine samples are collected at both timepoints for proteomic analysis. Overall, the study shows high compliance (100%) and low toxicity (no grade 4 adverse event). Trends of increase in cleaved caspase 3 and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and trends of decrease in Ki-67 and nuclear to cytoplasm ratio of estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha are observed in the BSE arm only, consistent with the significantly altered signaling pathways identified in urinary proteomic analysis. Conclusions. Anticancer activities of ITCs are observed in breast cancer patients, supporting the potential beneficial roles of ITC-containing cruciferous vegetables in breast cancer prognosis. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2022	66	12			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202101094					FSTA:2022-10-Jq14185

Food Chemistry					Three commercial lactic acid bacteria (LAB), namely Lactobacillus acidophilus 85 (La85), Lactobacillus helveticus 76 (Lh76) and Lactobacillus plantarum 90 (Lp90), were employed to investigate the effects on the phenolic compounds, antioxidant capacities and flavor volatiles of kiwifruit juices prepared from two cultivars (Actinidia deliciosa cv. Xuxiang and Actinidia chinensis cv. Hongyang). Results showed that both kiwifruit juices were favorable matrices for LAB growth and the colony counts remained above 9.0 log CFU/mL after fermentation. Total phenolics and flavonoids in Xuxiang and Hongyang juices were increased dramatically by Lh76. Correspondingly, antioxidant capacities based on DPPH, ABTS and FRAP methods were improved significantly and positively correlated with protocatechuic acid and catechin contents (p< 0.05), two newly formed phytochemicals in fermented kiwifruit juices. Furthermore, results of hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that flavor profiles were improved significantly by LAB, and there were noticeable differences between fermented Xuxiang and Hongyang juices.

Physicochemical and rheological characteristics of pectin extracted from renewable orange peel employing conventional and green technologies.		Food Hydrocolloids					Hydrochloric acid-(HAE), citric acid-(CAE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of pectins from orange peels, as a whole or their albedos, was performed. Pectin yield varied from 10.6 to 22.8%, galacturonic acid content (GalA) from 46 to 73.5%, intrinsic viscosity [eta] from 0.3 to 0.8 dL/g and molecular weight from 5 to 15 kDa. All pectins were high methoxy pectins with a degree of esterification (DE) > 50% and their solutions presented acidic pH values. The studied properties were affected by both extraction conditions and raw material. The gelling and emulsifying properties of the pectins were also evaluated. HAE pectin-based emulsions were more stable and showed greater viscosity and lower conductivity. All pectins formed a gel network on cooling from 95°C to 5°C, which was thermally irreversible with the exception of CAE pectins that presented an increase of moduli at temperatures >40°C. A thermal annealing behaviour was observed when gels were taken to high temperature and re-cooled. All gels exhibited great syneresis. Overall, the extracted pectins can be good candidates for the formation of food products of specific textural and rheological properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Zipeng Liu; Ling Chen; Bo Zheng							Control of starch-lipid interactions on starch digestibility during hot-extrusion 3D printing for starchy foods.		Food & Function					The nutritional design of personalized starchy foods has become a research hotspot in the field of food science. Driven by the immense functional and nutritional implications of starch-lipid binary interactions, this study is aimed at designing starch digestibility by controlling the interaction between starch and glycerol monostearate (GMS) /stearic acid (SA) using a hot-extrusion 3D printing (HE-3DP) environment. The results indicated that the thermal shear force in the HE-3DP environment promoted hydrophobic interactions between starch and lipids, forming a V-type starch-lipid complex with a compact and ordered structure, thus enhancing enzymatic resistance. Compared with GMS, SA with linear hydrophobic chains was inclined to compound with starch to form a more ordered structure. Interestingly, the slowly digestible starch (SDS) and resistant starch (RS) content reached 25.06% when the added SA content was 10%. Besides, correlations between the structural parameters and digestibility were established, which provided crucial information for designing nutritional starchy food systems using HE-3DP. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	9	5317	5326	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00558a					FSTA:2022-08-Lc1383
J		Ziping Ai; Yongkang Xie; Xingyi Li; Dengwen Lei; Ambrose, K.; Yanhong Liu							Revealing color change and drying mechanisms of pulsed vacuum steamed Cistanche deserticola through bioactive components, microstructural and starch gelatinization properties.		Food Research International					Cistanche deserticola is a famous herbal medicine and has been used worldwide for its kidney-tonifying and anti-aging values. This study investigated the effects of pulsed vacuum steaming (PVS) on bioactive phenylethanoid glycosides (PhGs), total soluble sugars, polysaccharides, color, drying characteristics, microstructure, and starch gelatinization properties of Cistanche deserticola. PVS pretreatment significantly increased PhGs and soluble sugar content while reduced the polysaccharides content. And increasing the material core temperature to 75 °C at the largest diameter was proposed as the optimal steaming condition and the PhGs content was increased by 1.11 times compared with that by atmospheric steaming. The color of steamed samples changed to oily black due to Maillard reaction. PhGs content was significantly (P < 0.05) positively correlated with total color difference (DeltaE). Steaming until the DeltaE value of 15.95 could achieve the maximum accumulation of PhGs, corresponding to the highest increasing ratio of echinacoside and acteoside. Starch was completely gelatinized and formed a barrier layer adhering to the cell surface when the material core temperature reached 75 °C at the largest diameter, explaining why after steaming the Cistanche deserticola drying time was prolonged by 85.71 %. The study can provide an innovative steaming technology and optimal process parameters for obtaining high-quality Cistanche deserticola decoction pieces, as well as propose a non-destructive testing method to quickly predict PhGs content based on color parameters during the steaming process.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The effects of hot air impingement drying (HAID), hot air drying with temperature and humidity process control (HADTHPC), medium-and short-wave infrared drying (MSWID), shade drying (HD) and sun drying (SD) on the drying characteristics and physicochemical quality of Stevia leaves were investigated, MSWID was screened out most suitable for Stevia leaves drying. The relationships among drying time, microstructure, color and nutrients retention were analyzed. Compared with other drying methods, MSWID significantly reduced drying time by 15.38% and better preserved the nutrients (steviol glycosides and chlorogenic acids) due to the formation of a distinct microporous structure. Moreover, medium wave infrared (MIR) drying was superior to short wave infrared (SIR) in retaining steviol glycosides and color and improving drying efficiency. Brightness and greenness of dried Stevia leaves were significantly correlated with glycosides and chlorogenic acids content, respectively. MIR at 60°C is recommended as the most suitable drying conditions due to the highest comprehensive score (0.723) considering drying time, energy consumption and quality. Overall, MSWID is a promising drying technology for realizing high-quality and efficient industrial production of Stevia leaves.

J		Ziping Ai; Samir Mowafy; Yanhong Liu							Comparative analyses of five drying techniques on drying attributes, physicochemical aspects, and flavor components of Amomum villosum fruits.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Amomum villosum fruit is an attractive spice owing to its pleasant aromatic properties, and drying is an efficacious way to maintain its therapeutic and trading values. In this study, Amomum villosum fruits were dried using five drying technologies namely, freeze drying (FD), hot air impingement drying (HAID), hot air drying with temperature and humidity process control (HADTHPC), HADTHPC combined with radio frequency-vacuum drying (HADTHPC + RFVD), as well as medium-and short-wave infrared drying (MSWID). Quality and drying characteristics were compared. Result showed that FD achieved the best color retention, the lowest shell burst ratio, and the best retention of flavor profiles due to the complete glandular trichomes structure; however, it recorded the longest drying time and the highest energy consumption. HADTHPC + RFVD, combining the advantages of HADTHPC and RFVD, had the shortest drying time, the highest conservation of total flavonoids content (TFC), the best antioxidant activity, and low energy consumption compared with the other thermal drying methods. After drying, the content of esters decreased, while alcohols content increased. GC-IMS indicated the fingerprints of the four thermal dehydrated samples exhibiting similar signal intensities. Therefore, in terms of maintaining quality and saving energy, HADTHPC + RFVD would be a promising drying technology for Amomum villosum fruits.

Food Chemistry					In order to broaden the application of grape skin anthocyanin extract (GSAE) in flour products, the interaction of gliadin (Gli) and GSAE were investigated. Seven anthocyanin components from GSAE were identified by HPLC-MS2, which could form complexes with Gli having different binding rates based on UV, FTIR and HPLC analysis. The fluorescence quenching experiment showed that GSAE was capable of efficiently quenching the intrinsic fluorescence of Gli through hydrophobic interactions, and the binding parameters were near to one unit at the given temperatures. Additionally, GSAE binding changed the conformational properties of Gli, increasing alpha-helix and beta-turn content, but decreasing beta-sheet and irregular coil content. The molecular docking suggested that Gli possessed various binding sites bound with different anthocyanin monomers, mainly depending on hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. These findings further proved the formation of Gli-GSAE complex, indicating the potential of anthocyanins as natural colorant.

J		Ziqi Wang; Liang Qiao; Qinqin Zheng; Haolei Han; Zuguang Li; Xiangchun Zhang; Hongping Chen							Combined hepatotoxicity and toxicity mechanism of intermedine and lycopsamine.		Toxins					Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are common constituents of plants and have serious hepatotoxicity. Intermedine (Im) and lycopsamine (La) are two monoesters of PAs that frequently coexist in the PA-containing plants (e.g., comfrey and tea). The present study aimed to explore the combined hepatotoxicity and toxicity mechanism of the Im and La mixture. In vitro, the combined cytotoxicity of the Im and La mixture on human hepatocytes (HepD) was examined by CCK-8, colony formation, wound healing, and Annexin V/PI staining assays. The combination of Im and La inhibited the ability of HepD cells to proliferate, colonize, and migrate and induced hepatocytes apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. In addition to significantly causing a burst of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitochondrial apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the Im and La mixture can also cause an increase in intracellular Ca2+, triggering the PERK/eIF2alpha/ATF4/CHOP apoptosis pathway. This study provided the first direct evidence that the combined PAs induced hepatotoxicity through ER-mediated apoptosis. These results supplemented the basic toxicity data for the combined PAs and provided a new perspective for the risk assessment of combined PA toxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

Food & Function					In this study, the effects of crude Fuzhuan brick tea polysaccharides (CFBTPS) and their purified fraction (FBTPS-3) on colitis induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in mice were investigated. Both CFBTPS and FBTPS-3 exhibited intestinal anti-inflammatory activities, including restoring body weight, colon length and solid fecal weight, and decreasing the disease activity index score in mice. Moreover, the expression of lipocalin-2 in colitis could be significantly reduced. The inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha) and lipopolysaccharides in the serum and the expression of inflammation-related mRNA in the colon tissue were decreased. Both CFBTPS and FBTPS-3 could increase tight junction proteins (Occludin, Claudin-1 and ZO-1), promoting the intestinal barrier function. For gut microbiota, DSS treatment resulted in abnormal proliferation of Bifidobacteria, while FBTPS-3 could restore this disorder to a certain extent. In addition, FBPTS-3 promoted the growth of probiotics such as Bacteroides, Parasutterella and Collinsella. Both CFBTPS and FBTPS-3 could attenuate colitis; what's more, FBTPS-3 exhibited a better anti-inflammatory effect than CFBTPS. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	2	649	663	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02702f					FSTA:2022-05-Hn4333

Food Chemistry					Natural deep eutectic solvents (NADESs) have received considerable attention for green extraction. In this study, ultrasonic-assisted natural deep eutectics were applied for hydrodistillation to extract essential oil from perilla leaves. Compared to hydrodistillation assisted with ultrasound, this novel method effectively raised the yield of perilla leaf EO from 0.21% to 0.69% (choline chloride: malic acid, molar ratio 2:1) and broadened the types of chemical compositions (71 in total), especially aliphatic and aromatic compounds. Stronger antimicrobial and antioxidant activity was confirmed, and phenolics were increased. Additionally, the pH of the final solution was detected. The leaf residues were dried, weighed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy to show the influence of NADESs' strong extractability. This new extraction method may be applicable in edible natural product extraction and provide a reference for further exploration of NADESs.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The changes in polyphenol fractions after in vitro fermentation of apple peel polyphenol (APP) by gut microbiota as well as the effects of APP on the growth, pH value, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production and intestinal flora composition of gut microbiota fermentation were firstly explored in this study. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus in the APP group was 49.55% with an increment of 49.40% compared with the blank group, while that of Bifidobacterium was 13.32%. Moreover, the flora produced 37.093 0.478mM of SCFAs including acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and valeric acid during the process of fermentation, thus reduced the environmental pH value. In addition, polyphenol fractions in APP were altered by gut microbiota fermentation to some extent, for example, glycosides were hydrolysed to aglycones. These findings suggested APP as a potential prebiotic agent to alleviate the disorder of intestinal flora. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	7	4268	4276	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15751					FSTA:2022-10-Je14336

Toxins					Ochratoxin A (OTA) is second only to aflatoxin in toxicity among mycotoxins. Recent studies have shown that selenomethionine (SeMet) has a protective effect on mycotoxin-induced toxicity. The purpose of this study was to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of SeMet on OTA-induced liver injury in rabbits. Sixty 35-day-old rabbits with similar body weight were randomly divided into five groups: control group, OTA group (0.2 mg/kg OTA), OTA + 0.2 mg/kg SeMet group, OTA + 0.4 mg/kg SeMet group and OTA + 0.6 mg/kg SeMet group. Rabbits were fed different doses of the SeMet diet for 21 d, and OTA was administered for one week from day 15 (the control group was provided the same dose of NaHCO3 solution). The results showed that 0.4 mg/kg SeMet could significantly improve the liver injury induced by OTA poisoning. SeMet supplementation can improve the changes in physiological blood indexes caused by OTA poisoning in rabbits and alleviate pathological damage to the rabbit liver. SeMet also increased the activities of SOD, GSH-Px and T-AOC and significantly decreased the contents of ROS, MDA, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, effectively alleviating the oxidative stress and inflammatory response caused by OTA poisoning. In addition, OTA poisoning inhibits Nrf2 and HO-1 levels, ultimately leading to peroxide reaction, while SeMet activates the Nrf2 signaling pathway and enhances the expression of the HO-1 downstream Nrf2 gene. These results suggest that Se protects the liver from OTA-induced hepatotoxicity by regulating Nrf2/HO-1 expression. © 2022 by the authors.

Food Research International					Patatin is a useful plant protein with excellent gelation properties that could be used as a gelling agent in the food industry. However, the commercial production of patatin is limited because the traditional extraction methods are inefficient and time consuming. Production of patatin with gelation properties by microorganisms is a promising alternative route. In this study, 1424.5 mg/L patatin storage protein with great gelation properties could be obtained in a 5-L bioreactor after optimization of the signal peptide, the promoter, and the fed-batch process when a Pichia pastoris GS115, but not Escherichia coli, expression system was used. Compared with commercial potato-extracted patatins, P. pastoris-derived patatins showed better gelation properties, such as a lower gel-forming concentration and gelation temperature. In addition, the gel strength of P. pastoris-derived patatins was comparable with that of potato-extracted patatins. These results suggested that P. pastoris-derived patatins have the potential to replace current potato-derived ones, which are now widely used in plant-based meat products.

J		Ziqing Yan; Miaomiao Zhang; Mengjie Xu; Jinglin Yu; Copeland, L.; Yongchun Huang; Shujun Wang							Effect of debranching and differential ethanol precipitation on the formation and fermentation properties of maize starch-lipid complexes.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of starch debranching followed by differential ethanol precipitation on the formation and in vitro fermentation of starch-lipid complexes. Three groups of linear glucan chains, with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 383~2950, 37~75, and 3~8, were obtained after debranched maize starch (DMS) was fractionated by differential ethanol precipitation. The glucan fraction with DP 383~2950 formed only type IIb complexes with lauric acid (LA), whereas the fraction with DP 37~75 formed predominantly type Ia complexes. The glucan faction with DP 8~32 did not form V-complexes with LA. In vitro fermentation of the type IIb complexes with human fecal samples promoted the proliferation of butyrate-producing bacteria Megamonas, Blautia, and Megasphaera and resulted in a larger amount of butyrate and total short-chain fatty acids being produced than in similar fermentations of the maize starch-LA complex, DMS-LA complex, and fructo-oligosaccharides. This study showed that starch-lipid complexes with a more stable type IIb crystallite resulted in a greater production of butyrate.										2022	70	29	9132	9142	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c03081					FSTA:2023-03-Mc1902

Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coliare an important pathogen causing food poisoning. The rapid detection of viable E. coliO157 in vegetables and fruits at single-cell level is critical because of the low infective dose of this pathogen. In this study, an immunomagnetic flow cytometry (IMFC)-based method was developed to detect E. coliO157 in lettuce and strawberries inoculated with 1 CFU/25 g. This method developed immunomagnetic (IM)-beads to capture E. coliO157 cells. The pre-enrichment of E. coliO157 and IM-bead separation rapidly increased the concentration of cells to a detectable range for flow cytometry. Compared with the plate-based method, the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the IMFC-based method were 100% in 166 samples, including 100 artificially contaminated samples, 60 retail samples, and six O157-positive samples for proficiency testing. The developed IMFC-based method was found to be effective in detecting E. coliO157 at single-cell level in 25 g of lettuce or strawberry with relatively shorter associated time to results of 5.7 h. Therefore, the IMFC-based method could improve detection efficiency and also make early warnings in a short time.										2022	19	1	36	44	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2021.0031					FSTA:2022-05-Ja5987

Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Salmonella, Escherichia coli O157, and Shigella flexneri are typical foodborne pathogens in ground beef, which can cause severe infection even when present as a single cell. Flow cytometry (FCM) methods are widely applied in the rapid detection of pathogens in food products. In this study, we report an FCM-based method for detecting single cells of Salmonella, E. coli O157, and S. flexneri in 25g ground beef samples. We fluorescently labeled specific antibodies that could effectively identify bacterial cells, prepared single-cell samples by serial dilution, and optimized the pre-enrichment time. The results showed that 7h of pre-enrichment is appropriate for sensitive single-cell detection by FCM. Finally, we evaluated this method in artificially contaminated and retail beef samples. This study outlines a novel highly sensitive FCM-based method to detect Salmonella, E. coli O157, and S. flexneri in beef samples within 8h that can be applied to the rapid and multiplexed detection of foodborne pathogens.										2022	19	4	272	280	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2021.0088					FSTA:2022-09-Sg4638

Food Chemistry					Zinc-thiazole is a new fungicide that was independently developed in China and has a high efficiency and low toxicity. A modified derivatization method was established to measure zinc-thiazole in foods of plant origin. Zinc-thiazole decomposed into 2-amino-5-mercapto-1,3, 4-thiadiazole (AMT) under alkaline conditions, and the AMT was extracted with acidic acetonitrile (pH = 3). The AMT was quantitated by HPLC-MS/MS, and then the amount of zinc-thiazole residue was calculated. Good linearity (R2> 0.9997) was obtained in 0.001-1mg/L. The limit of quantification of zinc-thiazole was 0.02mg/kg in peaches, grapes, brown rice and soybeans. A qualified accuracy (recoveries of 75%-90%) and precision (RSD of 1%-5%) were obtained at three fortified levels. This method was applied to peach samples collected from farmland, and the zinc-thiazole residues complied with the residue limits. In the future, this method could be used to analyze residues and in the risk assessment of metal-thiazole fungicides.

J		Zirui Huang; Yun Liu; Xiaoyan Liu; Kewen Chen; Wenyu Xiong; Yuyang Qiu; Xiaoyu He; Bin Liu; Feng Zeng							Sanghuangporus vaninii mixture ameliorated type 2 diabetes mellitus and altered intestinal microbiota in mice.		Food & Function					Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease mainly caused by insufficient insulin secretion and insulin resistance. In addition, T2DM is often accompanied by dysregulation of lipid metabolism and inflammatory response. The effect of oral administration of a Sanghuangporus vaninii mixture (SVM) on T2DM mice was evaluated. The results showed that SVM intervention could change body weight and glucose/lipid metabolism-related indicators. In addition, it can also improve the level of inflammatory factors to play a protective role in the pancreas and the jejunum. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis indicated that SVM intervention significantly altered the intestinal microbiota in mice, elevating the relative abundances of Bacteroidetes, Verrucomicrobia, Akkermansia, Alloprevotella, and Blautia, and decreasing the relative abundances of Firmicutes, Lactobacillus, Flavonifractor, and Odoribacter in the feces of diabetic mice, compared with the model group. Moreover, the functional modules of fatty acid degradation, glycerolipid metabolism, purine metabolism, histidine metabolism, folate biosynthesis, GABAergic synapse, etc. were regulated by SVM intervention in T2DM mice. Additionally, integrative correlation analysis revealed that the representative intestinal microbes in response to SVM intervention in diabetic mice were markedly related to glucose/lipid metabolism-related indicators (e.g. blood glucose, insulin resistance, lipid indexes, and inflammatory factors). Hence, these findings suggest that the SVM could modulate the structure, abundance, and function of intestinal microbiota to potentially ameliorate T2DM and its complications (e.g. hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation) in mice. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	22	11758	11769	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo02268k					FSTA:2023-03-Jq3803

Food Chemistry					The peroxide value (PV) is an important indicator to assess quality of edible oils. However, traditional methods for determining PV are complicated for operating and lack sensitivity. In this paper, we report a fast, reusable, selective and sensitive room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP)-based sensor to determine the PV of edible oils. The sensor comprises a lead-based metal-organic framework (Pb-MOF, Pb4O (TPA)3, TPA: (terephthalic acid). Luminescence studies reveal that bright RTP of Pb-MOF quenched significantly by iodide ions (I-), a classic reductant for peroxides in edible oils, thus the determination of the PV is possible. Crucially, the proposed method yields responses within 10min and has a wide linear range of 0.35-25.62mmol/kg, a low detection limit of 30mumol/kg, and high selectivity for PV detection. The sensing system was successfully applied to determine the PVs of edible oils and monitor the PV of rapeseed oil during storage.

J		Zisheng Han; Mingchun Wen; Haiwei Zhang; Liang Zhang; Xiaochun Wan; Chi-Tang Ho							LC-MS based metabolomics and sensory evaluation reveal the critical compounds of different grades of Huangshan Maofeng green tea.		Food Chemistry					Six grades of Huangshan Maofeng (HSMF) green tea were studied by LC-MS based metabolomics combined with sensory evaluation on bitterness, astringency and sweet aftertaste. Although there was no significant correlation (p> 0.05) between tea grades and the contents of total polyphenols and flavonoids, non-targeted metabolomics revealed that all grades of tea could be classified into two groups, group 1 (T1, T2) and group 2 (T3, 1, 2, 3). The main marker compounds responsible for distinguishing the two groups were procyanidins, flavonoid glycosides, and four hydrolysable tannins, including monogalloyl glucose, digalloyl glucose, trigalloyl glucose and galloyl-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-glucose. The Pearson correlation coefficients of these hydrolysable tannins with HSMF green tea grades were between 0.82 and 0.95. Furthermore, their Pearson correlation coefficients regarding sweet aftertaste were in the range of 0.73-0.83. This study suggested combination of metabolomics and sensory evaluation could provide an insight in searching for more potential taste-active components.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Amadori rearrangement products (ARPs) derived from the Maillard reaction between theanine and glucose (ARP 1), as well as pyroglutamic acid and glucose (ARP 2), were identified by liquid chromatograph tandem mass spectroscopy methods. The effects of initial reactant ratio, temperature, pH, and heating time on ARP generation were analyzed. The formation of both ARPs was most favored under 100°C, while an alkaline environment slightly promoted the generation of ARP 1 and acidic conditions contributed more to ARP 2 formation. The decomposition of ARP 1 was suggested to be the predominant formation mechanism of ARP 2. Preparation, purification, and structure identification of ARP 1 were conducted, with its structure confirmed as 1-deoxy-1-l-theanino-d-fructose. The contents of ARP 1 in green, black, dark, white, yellow, and Oolong teas were quantitatively determined, of which black teas contained the highest levels of ARP 1, possibly due to the high glucose content and processing techniques.										2022	70	37	11727	11737	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04560					FSTA:2023-01-Hn0864

Food Research International					In this study, a twelve-week intervention was conducted to investigate the anti-obesity effects of yak bone collagen hydrolysates (YBCH) on mice with a high-fat diet. The obesity-associated phenotypes of mice were detected and the feces of mice were jointly analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. Results indicated that supplementation with YBCH could ameliorate the obesity-associated phenotypes of mice, especially with the medium dose (MD) and high dose (HD) of YBCH. Compared with the high-fat diet control (HC) group, the ratio of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the fecal microbiota of the low dose (LD), MD, and HD groups was separately decreased by 29.83 %, 70.85 %, and 75.70 %. Lachnospiraceae and Muribaculaceae were the key bacteria for the YBCH intervention, which might be attributed to their different substrate preferences. The joint analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequencing and untargeted metabolomics suggested that the anti-obesity effects of YBCH might be achieved by up-regulating the arginine and proline metabolism and down-regulating the aromatic amino acids metabolism via the gut microbiota.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The apple greasiness disorder can seriously affect the quality of appearance and commercial value. However, the complex molecular mechanism of fatty acid desaturases (FADs) in greasiness disorder has not been explored. In this study, greasiness disorder of susceptible cultivar "Golden Delicious" apples could be characterized by comprehensive evaluation system: At the physiological level, the disorder was associated with high level of the greasiness score, the respiration rate, ethylene release and the MDA content; At the morphological level, it caused the epidermal wax crystals disappeared with the appearance of a liquid wax form of the pericarp; At the metabolic level, it increased the liquid greasiness components and contents. As the MdFADs, induced by the greasiness esters, were key genes in the greasiness disorder process, and MdFAD27 and MdFAD28 were obtained by analyzing their family members at transcriptomic level during postharvest storage. Furthermore, the results from both homologous overexpression in apples and heterologous overexpression in tomatoes indicated that MdFAD27 and MdFAD28 were involved in the formation of the main substrate of greasiness esters and the phenotype of greasiness disorder. Collectively, this study shows that MdFAD27 and MdFAD28 influence the development of greasiness disorder in apples by promoting the production of greasiness components.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In this paper, the effects of different succinic anhydride (SA) additions on the flexibility of soy protein isolate (SPI) were investigated, and changes in protein conformation and interfacial functional properties were measured. The structure-effect relationship between conformation, flexibility, and interfacial functional properties was established. Results. SPI was bound to SA through disulfide bonds, and the zeta potential was reduced. The beta-sheet content decreased, the disordered structure increased, and there were changes in tertiary structure and microstructure. The surface hydrophobicity, disulfide bond content, and solution turbidity were reduced to 5063, 1.0967mumolg-1, and 0.0036mumolg-1 respectively. The best flexibility of SPI (0.3977) and interfacial functional properties were obtained when the mass ratio of SA/SPI was 15%. Correlation analysis showed a highly significant positive correlation (P<0.01) between flexibility and emulsification and foaming properties, with correlation coefficients of 0.960 and 0.942 for flexibility with emulsifying activity and emulsion stability respectively, and 0.972 and 0.929 for flexibility with foaming capacity and foaming stability respectively. Conclusion. The results suggest that succinylation-induced conformational changes of SPI improved its interfacial functional properties by changing its flexibility. These results provide theoretical guidelines for the development and application of highly emulsifiable and stable soy protein products utilizing succinylation. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	14	6454	6463	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12012					FSTA:2023-01-Gg0348
J		Zitomer, N. C.; Rybak, M. E.; Sternberg, M. R.							Assessing the impacts of preanalytical field sampling challenges on the reliability of serum aflatoxin B1-lysine measurements by use of LC-MS/MS.		Toxins					Aflatoxin exposure is endemic in developing countries with warm, humid climates that promote toxigenic mold growth on crops and foodstuffs. Estimating human aflatoxin exposure is key to identifying and abating contamination sources. Serum aflatoxin B1 bound to albumin lysine (AFB1-lys) is a preferred exposure biomarker, but field sample collection, processing, transportation, and storage logistics are challenging. We validated an improved LC-MS/MS method for serum AFB1-lys and applied it to three field sampling challenges: transportation/storage (elevated temperature); collection/processing (hemolysis); and sample type substitution (heparinized plasma). Our new LC-MS/MS method had a LOD of 0.03 ng/mL, accuracy (mean spike recovery) of 112%, total imprecision (replicate pool measurements) ≤5% at ≥ 0.2 ng/mL, and results that were 95.1% similar (mean percentage similarity) to an established method. AFB1-lys in human serum spiked with serum from aflatoxin-dosed rats was stable for 14 days at both ambient (22.5°C) and elevated (38°C) temperatures. Simulated hemolysis (adding 0.25-3 mg hemoglobin) did not affect AFB1-lys accuracy at ≥0.5 ng/mL but caused 10-25% signal suppression. Heparinized plasma AFB1-lys was 99.0% similar to serum but interfered with albumin measurements (bromocresol green) causing spurious low bias. Further investigation is warranted, but our findings suggest that AFB1-lys is pre-analytically robust. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the bacterial and fungal diversities and compositions in the traditional fermented yak milk from 5 major ecotopes of the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau. Totally 47 lactic acid bacteria species or subspecies were found in the traditional fermented yak milk, and the dominant bacterial species were Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Streptococcus salivarius, and S. thermophiles. Although differences in the relative abundances of bacteria were found among the samples from 5 ecotopes, there were no correlations between the dominant lactic acid bacteria species and the pH of traditional fermented yak milk or altitude, longitude, and latitude of sampling sites. There were 9 yeast species and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia kudriavzevii and Debaryomyces hansenii were the dominant fungal species. Among the 5 ecotopes, samples from the ecotope located in the western region of the plateau with the harshest environment (altitude 4591-4977 m) had the lowest relative abundance of L. delbrueckii but the highest S. salivarius and S. thermophiles. In brief, the present study provides important information on an overview of the microbial resources in the traditional fermented yak milk from the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau, and the ecological regions had a remarkable influence on the microbial compositions in the traditional fermented yak milk.

J		Ziwei Chen; Jiajun Chen; Zhaolin Huang; Dawei Ni; Yuqing Tian; Wanmeng Mu							Mutations in the different residues between dextransucrase Gtf-DSM and reuteransucrase gtfo for the investigation of linkage specificity determinants.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The dextransucrase Gtf-DSM has 99.3% sequence identity with the reuteransucrase GtfO, and only 11 out of 1045 residues are different between their N-terminally truncated recombinant forms. Gtf-DSM is capable of synthesizing a dextran with 1% (alpha1 2), 6% (alpha1 4), 24% (alpha1 3), and 69% (alpha1 6) linkages, while GtfO produces a reuteran with 21% (alpha1 6) and 79% (alpha1 4) linkages. In this work, using recombinant Gtf-DSM and GtfO as templates, parallel substitutions targeting these 11 distinguishing residues were performed to investigate their linkage specificity determinants. The combinatorial mutation (I937L/D977A/D1083V/Q1086K/K1087G) at the acceptor binding subsites + 1 and + 2 nearly converted the linkage specificity of Gtf-DSM to that of GtfO. Surprisingly, all of the individual or combinatorial mutations in four residues from domains IV and V of Gtf-DSM significantly altered the linkage specificity of Gtf-DSM. Additionally, all mutations in the 11 distinguishing residues of Gtf-DSM resulted in a dramatically reduced transferase/hydrolysis activity ratio, which was closer to that of GtfO. These mutation results suggested that the linkage specificity differences between Gtf-DSM and GtfO are determined by the distinct micro-physicochemical environments, formed by the concerted action of a series of residues not only from the acceptor binding subsites + 1 and + 2 but also from domains IV and V.										2022	70	38	12107	12116	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04562					FSTA:2023-02-Bg0212

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Ginsenoside Rg2 (G-Rg2) in the rhizome of Panax ginseng can modify lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in the liver induced by a high-fat diet. This research adds to this by assessing the potential antifibrosis effect of G-Rg2 (including possible mechanisms). G-Rg2 significantly improved pathological changes in liver tissue induced by a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined, high-fat diet (CDAHFD), it inhibited serum transaminase, plasma lipopolysaccharide, and liver hydroxyproline levels; it inhibited TGF-beta1, alpha-SMA, and COL1A1 expression, it activated the AKT/mTOR signal pathway, and it inhibited liver expression of autophagy-related proteins. The in vitro experiments showed that G-Rg2 also restored the autophagy flux impairment induced by oleic acid and inhibited TGF-beta1 expression by promoting p62 degradation in hepatocytes. In hepatic stellate (HSC-T6) cells, G-Rg2 reversed lipopolysaccharide-induced activation through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, inhibiting autophagy. Thus, G-Rg2 ameliorates CDAHFD-induced liver fibrosis and lipopolysaccharide-induced HSC-T6 cell activation by inhibiting AKT/mTOR-mediated autophagy.										2022	70	6	1911	1922	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07578					FSTA:2022-11-Ge5308
J		Ziwei Liu; Jinbao Jiang; Mengquan Li; Deshuai Yuan; Cheng Nie; Yilin Sun; Peng Zheng							Identification of moldy peanuts under different varieties and moisture content using hyperspectral imaging and data augmentation technologies.		Foods					Aflatoxins in moldy peanuts are seriously toxic to humans. These kernels need to be screened in the production process. Hyperspectral imaging techniques can be used to identify moldy peanuts. However, the changes in spectral information and texture information caused by the difference in moisture content in peanuts will affect the identification accuracy. To reduce and eliminate the influence of this factor, a data augmentation method based on interpolation was proposed to improve the generalization ability and robustness of the model. Firstly, the near-infrared hyperspectral images of 5 varieties, 4 classes, and 3 moisture content gradients with 39,119 kernels were collected. Then, the data augmentation method called the difference of spectral mean (DSM) was constructed. K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machines (SVM), and MobileViT-xs models were used to verify the effectiveness of the data augmentation method on data with two gradients and three gradients. The experimental results show that the data augmentation can effectively reduce the influence of the difference in moisture content on the model identification accuracy. The DSM method has the highest accuracy improvement in 5 varieties of peanut datasets. In particular, the accuracy of KNN, SVM, and MobileViT-xs using the data of two gradients was improved by 3.55%, 4.42%, and 5.9%, respectively. Furthermore, this study provides a new method for improving the identification accuracy of moldy peanuts and also provides a reference basis for the screening of related foods such as corn, orange, and mango. © 2022 by the authors.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. To investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS)-induced autophagy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and the intervention mechanism of Portulaca oleracea L. (POL) extract, a medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immune-regulating, and antitumor properties, in vitro and in vivo. Methods and Results. An IL-10-deficient mouse model is used for in vivo experiments; a thapsigargin (Tg)-stimulated ERS model of human colonic mucosal epithelial cells (HIECs) is used for in vitro experiments. The levels of ERS-autophagy-related proteins are examined by immunofluorescence and Western blot. Cellular ultrastructure is assessed with transmission electron microscopy. POL extract promotes a healing effect on colitis by regulating ERS-autophagy through the protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK)-eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha)/Beclin1-microtubule-associated protein light chain 3II (LC3II) pathway.

Food Control					The survival of murine norovirus (MNV) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) in bottled drinking water, strawberries, and oysters stored at different temperatures for various durations was investigated. In drinking water, over 6.4 and 1.6 log10 plaque-forming units (PFU/mL) reductions of viable MNV and HAV were observed after 20 days of incubation at 35 °C. After 160 days of incubation at 20 °C, there was a sharp decrease in the MNV (>6.4 log10 PFU/mL) and HAV (>2.9 log10 PFU/mL) load but only a slight reduction at 4 °C. In fresh strawberry, the MNV and HAV titers reduced by 1.0 and 0.9 log10 PFU/g after incubation for 2 days at 25 °C, by 0.85 and 1.22 log10 PFU/g after 3 days of incubation at 15 °C, and by 0.7 and 1.1 log10 PFU/g after 7 days of incubation at 4 °C, respectively. After 3 days of incubation at 4, 15, and 25 °C in oyster reductions of over 0.3, 0.4, and 0.6 log10 PFU/mL in the MNV load and 0.16, 0.28, and 0.52 log10 PFU/mL in the HAV load were observed, respectively. Even though, survival of the two viruses fluctuated with temperature and food commodity. Therefore, our results indicate that major enteric foodborne viruses such as MNV and HAV can survive for long periods, with only a partial reduction in their titers. Owing to the persistence of foodborne viruses, preventive measures need to be taken to prevent food contamination.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Impacts of pectin oligosaccharide (POS) got from hawthorn fruitage on adiponectin signaling pathway and white adipose metabolism in mice fed with high-fat control. The results showed that POS significantly inhibited the levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, and down-regulated expression of CD68. POS dramatically reduced gene expression contents of fatty acid composite concerning enzymes ACC and FAS, as well as TG synthesis-related enzymes SCD-1 and DGAT1 as compared to a high-fat group (HFC). POS dramatically increased expression levels of oxidation-related enzymes of fatty acid ACO, CPT-1, and TG deposition-related enzymes ATGL and HSL as contrast to the high-fat control group. In addition, POS activated adiponectin-mediated AdipoR1/AMPK/PPARalpha signaling path by upregulating expression levels of AdipoR1, AMPK and PPARalpha. The results demonstrated that POS can improve lipid metabolism of adipose tissue, and contribute to the creation of functional foods to prevent and treat lipid metabolism disorders. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2022.										2022	31	9	1197	1205	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-022-01109-9					FSTA:2022-11-Aj21638
J		Zixing Chen; Hau Yin Chung							Pseudo-taste cells derived from rat taste and non-taste tissues: implications for cultured taste cell-based biosensors.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Although the technique for taste cell culture has been reported, cultured taste cells have remained poorly validated. This study systematically compared the cultured cells derived from both taste and non-taste tissues. Fourteen cell lines established from rat circumvallate papillae (RCVs* or RCVs), non-taste lingual epithelia (RVEs), and tail skins (RTLs) were analyzed by PCR, immunocytochemistry, proteomics, and calcium imaging. The cell lines were morphologically indistinguishable, and all expressed some taste-related molecules. Of the tested RCVs*, RCVs, RVEs, and RTLs (%), 84.77.8, 63.9 22.8, 46.8 0.3, and 40.8 15.1 of them were responsive to at least one tastant or ATP, respectively. However, the calcium signaling pathways in the responding cells differed from the canonical taste transduction pathways in the taste cells in vivo, suggesting that they were not genuine taste cells. In addition, the growth medium intended for taste cell culture did not prevent the proliferation of non-gustatory epithelial cells regardless of supplementation of Y-27632 and EGF. In conclusion, the current method for taste cell culture is susceptible to pseudo-taste cells that may lead to overinterpretation. Thus, biosensors that rely on calcium responses of cultured taste cells should be applied with extreme caution.										2022	70	35	10826	10835	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04934					FSTA:2023-01-Ag1433

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Zinc absorption in intestinal system could be strongly affected by the gastrointestinal digestion and absorption of zinc-chelating peptides serving as zinc carriers. In this study, a novel zinc-chelating sea cucumber synthetic peptide (SCSP) was synthesized to estimate its gastrointestinal digestion and promotive effect of zinc absorption in vitro. Results. Analysis of isothermal titration calorimetry suggested that the binding of SCSP and zinc (N 1) was exothermic, with relatively weak binding affinity (K = 1.0 * 10-3 molL-1). The formation of SCSP-Zn complexes brought morphological changes to the peptides confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which also indicated 6.88% of the existence of zinc element. In addition, the SCSP-Zn complexes remained stable under simulated human gastrointestinal digestion. In an in vitro study, the SCSP-Zn complex could successfully transport through the intestinal membrane in the model of everted rat gut sacs (nearly 7.5muMcm-2) as well as Caco-2 cells where the zinc transport reached 0.0014mgmL-1 carried by SCSP. Fluorescence staining experiments revealed free zinc accumulation inside the tissues and cells treated with the SCSP-Zn complex. Conclusions. The chelation SCSP-Zn had the promotion ability of zinc absorption in vitro and ex vivo experiments, which suggested a theoretical basis for the design and production of effective zinc chelating peptides as zinc carriers to improve zinc bioavailability. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	11	4542	4550	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11811					FSTA:2022-11-Rg4621

Food Chemistry					In this study, HS-SPME/GC-MS based untargeted and targeted flavoromics combing with olfactometry were employed to uncover aroma boundary compositions of five types of commercial barley malts with a wide range of Lovibond (L), including kilned base malts (1.8 L and 3.5 L) and roasted caramel malts (10 L, 60 L, and 120 L). Thirty-two compounds were identified as aroma-active with modified detection frequency (MF) > 50%. 3-Methylbutanal (malty), (2E)-nonenal (fatty, cardboard-like), and 2-furfural (burnt, bready) were recognized as the most influential odorants with MF > 70% in all the malts. After untargeted flavoromics, twenty-eight aromas were retained and quantitated. Furthermore, aroma boundary compositions inside/among malt groups were explored with PLS-DA. Eight aroma markers, 3-methylbutanal, 2-isopropyl-5-methyl-2-hexenal, (2E,4E)-Decadienal, 2-furfual, maltol, 2-acetylpyrrole, phenylacetaldehyde, and ethyl hexadecanoate were shortlisted for aroma boundary compositions regarding to the Lovibond of malts.

J		Zixuan Gu; Xiao Chen; Jiajia Rao; Bingcan Chen							Statistical evaluation to validate matrix-matched calibration for standardized beany odor compound quantitation in yellow pea flour using HS-SPME-GC-MS.		Food & Function					Accurate and precise quantitation of beany odor compounds is important in developing yellow pea (Pisum sativum L., YP) flour-based foods. Aiming at establishing standardized external calibration using an internal standard (ECIS) quantitation method, the effect of solvent extraction on matrix deodorization and systematic statistical analysis on quantitation was evaluated. Initially, accelerated dichloromethane extraction on YP flour and starch produced two clearest deodorized matrix-matched matrices. Secondly, due to the heteroskedasticity, weighted least squares regression (WLSR) was introduced to build calibration curves. The curve linearity and regression parameters were further confirmed via a t-test. Lastly, methodology indicators including LOD/LOQ, accuracy and precision, and the matrix effect (ME) were assessed. Results showed that there were no significant differences in the quantity of beany odor compounds interpolated from two deodorized matrices. This study demonstrated for the first time that despite the unignorable ME, deodorized starch is a feasible and affordable alternative to deodorized YP flour in the quantitation of beany odor compounds to achieve a reliable result. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	7	3968	3981	2042-650X				10.1039/d2fo00050d					FSTA:2022-07-Jp9993

Food Science & Nutrition					Cordyceps militaris (CM) is traditionally used as dietary therapy for lung cancer patients in China. CM extract (CME) is hydrosoluble fraction of CM and extensively investigated. Caspase-3-involved cell death is considered as its major anticancer mechanism but inconclusive. Therefore, we explore its caspase-3-dependent programmed cell death nature (apoptosis and pyroptosis) and validate its caspase-3-dependent property in loss-of-function experiment. Component profile of CME is detected by High Performance Liquid Chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-qTOF). Results show that CME causes pyroptosis-featured cell bubbling and cell lysis and inhibits cell proliferation in A549 cell. CME induces chromatin condensing and makes PI+/annexin V+ staining in bubbling cells, indicating genotoxicity, apoptosis, and pyroptosis cell death are caused by CME. High concentration of CME (200mug/ml) exerts G2/M and G0 cell cycles arresting and suppresses P53-downstream proliferative proteins, including P53, P21, CDC25B, CyclinB1, Bcl-2, and BCL2 associated agonist of cell death (BAD), but 1-100mug/ml of CME show less effect on proteins above. Correspondingly, caspase-3 activity and caspase-3 downstream proteins including pyroptotic effector gasdermin-E (GSDME) and apoptotic marker cleaved-poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) are significantly promoted by CME. Moreover, regarding membrane pore formation in pyroptotic cell, expression of membrane GSDME (GSDME antibody conjugated with PE-Cy7 for detection in flow cytometry) is remarkably increased by CME treatment. By contrast, other pyroptosis-related proteins such as P2X7, NLRP3, GSDMD, and Caspase-1 are not affected after CME treatment. Additionally, TET2 is unexpectedly raised by CME. In present of caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO (Ac-DC), CME-induced cytotoxicity, cell bubbling, and genotoxicity are reduced, and CME-induced upregulation of apoptosis (cleaved-PARP-1) and pyroptosis (GSDME-NT) proteins are reversed. Lastly, 22 components are identified in HPLC-qTOF experiment, and they are classified into trophism, neoadjuvant component, cytotoxic component, and cancer deterioration promoter according to previous references. Conclusively, CME causes caspase-3-dependent apoptosis and pyroptosis in A549 through caspase-3/PARP and caspase-3/GSDME pathways, and it provides basic insight into clinic application of CME for cancer patients. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Zixuan Yang; Dan Xu; Hongling Zhou; Fengfeng Wu; Xueming Xu							New insight into the contribution of wheat starch and gluten to frozen dough bread quality.		Food Bioscience					The contribution of starch granules to the baking properties of frozen dough bread has been investigated using reconstituted dough method. The baking and aging characteristics of frozen dough bread were studied by texture analyzer, colorimeter, DSC, FTIR and LF-NMR. Results showed that starch had more impact on bread than gluten in specific volume of frozen dough bread, while gluten contributed more in color and cell density of frozen dough bread crumb during 8-weeks frozen storage. The changes of hardness mainly contributed to starch deterioration in first 4 weeks, then it was dominated by gluten in the later 4-8 weeks. A-Type granules have more effect on texture properties, number of cells and enthalpy of frozen dough bread during storage. B-Type granules contributed more on the size of cells in bread. The main aging change of wheat starch in profiles of bread was provided by A-Type granules during frozen storage.

J		Zixuan Zhao; Jian Ming; Guohua Zhao; Lin Lei							Color, starch digestibility, and in vitro fermentation of roasted highland barley flour with different fractions.		Foods					Highland barley (HB) is commonly milled into flour for direct consumption or further processed with other food formulations. Nevertheless, the association between milling and HB flour properties remains lacking. This work studied the effect of particle sizes (coarse, 250-500mum; medium, 150-250mum; fine, <150mum) on physicochemical and nutritional properties of raw and sand-roasted HB flour. Gelatinization enthalpy decreased with increasing particle sizes of raw HB flour, while no endothermic transitions were observed in sand-roasted flour. Sand roasting destroyed starch granules and decreased short-range molecular order. Starch digestibility increased while total short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production decreased with decreasing particle sizes in all samples. The relative crystallinity of sand-roasted HB flour decreased by 80-88% compared with raw samples. Sand roasting raised in vitro starch digestibility, while total SCFAs during in vitro fecal fermentation decreased. Sand-roasted HB flour with particle sizes <150mum had the highest starch digestibility (94.0%) but the lowest production of total SCFAs (1.89-2.24mM). Pearson's correlation analysis confirmed the relationship between the nutritional qualities of HB flour and milling. © 2022 by the authors.

Journal of Dairy Science					A quantitative proteomic technique based on data-independent acquisition (DIA) was used to analyze differentially expressed caseins of Saanen goat milk samples collected from 3 regions in China (Guangdong, GD; Inner Mongolia, IM; Shaanxi, SX). A total of 345 proteins were quantified in each sample. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis showed that proteins were mainly involved in cellular process and cell and binding functions. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that proteins were mainly involved in metabolic pathways. Differentially expressed proteins (DEP) between goat milk from 3 comparison groups composed of paired regions were compared and analyzed. The number of DEP was 114, 69, and 79 for GD versus IM, GD versus SX, and IM versus SX, respectively. The GO enrichment analysis of the 3 comparison groups showed that differences were mainly related to the regulation of biological quality, biological regulation, and response to stimulus in terms of biological process; extracellular region for cellular component; and binding function for molecular function. Pathways in which DEP of GD versus IM, GD versus SX, and IM versus SX were mostly protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum for the first 2 groups and metabolic pathways for the last. Protein-protein interaction network analysis demonstrated that the most prominent DEP was heat shock protein 90 beta family member 1 for both the GD versus IM and the GD versus SX groups, and haptoglobin for the IM versus SX group. Data from this study may offer useful information for further investigation of the protein composition of Saanen goat milk and its application in the dairy industry.

J		Zixuan Zhao; Fengming Ma; Baiqing Zhang							Study on preservation method and mechanism of peeling waxy corn kernels treated with composite film.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, we show that the shelf life of peeled waxy corn is prolonged when an edible coating agent made of sodium alginate, phytic acid, and nisin is applied. The purpose of this edible coating agent is to create flexibility in transportation methods and allow for a longer transportation time, while upholding its superior taste and quality. Results showed that the edible coating agent can reduce the weight loss rate by 1% and decrease the firmness by nearly 1500g. It can also delay evaporation of soluble sugar content. Standardized tests were conducted to determine the film's anti-bacterial properties. Additionally, the water migration rate during storage was studied by low-field NMR and found that it can effectively reduce the loss of free water. This creation of this edible coating agent will set a new direction in how food items will be preserved. Novelty impact statement. The edible coating agent can extend the shelf life of peeling waxy corn and change the mode of transportation. The film can also reduce the weight loss rate of the peeling waxy corn, maintain its texture and soft taste and delay the decrease of soluble sugar, maintain its sweet taste. Through the determination of various indexes and water migration of waxy corn kernel during the storage, and the determination of membrane properties, the mechanism of the composite film was analyzed. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16451					FSTA:2022-07-Mc4368

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The effect of ellagic acid on the formation of pyrazine, methylpyrazine, 2,3-methylpyrazine, 2,6-methylpyrazine, 2,5-methylpyrazine, and trimethylpyrazine in the xylose-glycine Maillard reaction model was researched. Ellagic acid could either inhibit or promote pyrazine formation, depending on its addition time point and the pH of the system. The addition of ellagic acid during the accumulation period of an Amadori compound inhibited pyrazine formation by capturing the Amadori compound in the xylose-glycine Maillard system and decreasing the pyrazine precursors. The inhibitory effect of ellagic acid on pyrazine formation got more obvious with an increase in the pH of the system. However, when ellagic acid was added at the beginning of the xylose and glycine Maillard system and when the oxidizing substances such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal were significantly formed in the Maillard system, its oxidation could promote the formation of pyrazines.										2022	70	5	1618	1628	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c07391					FSTA:2022-06-Ac9283
J		Ziyang Gong; Yi-Fan Su, L.; Shiyue Zhang, J.; Tianli Chen; Yi-Cheng Wang							Understanding the association between date labels and consumer-level food waste.		Food Quality and Preference					Waste resulting from consumers' confusion about foods' date labels is a multi-billion-dollar problem in the United States. The present study examines the mechanisms underlying such labels' influence on people's willingness to consume, and whether exposure to additional information regarding sensory assessment of food products or storage practices could help to reduce food waste. We conducted a mixed-design experiment in which the between-subjects variable comprised five commonly used food date labels (i.e., "Best if Used By", "Use By", "Sell By", "Enjoy By", and a date without any explanatory phrase), and the within-subjects variable consisted of three information conditions (i.e., basic information, sensory information, and food-storage information). Our data indicate that date labels affected consumers' willingness to eat yogurt through two mediators, quality concerns and safety concerns. The direct effects on willingness to consume of variation in date-label wording were non-significant after controlling for the two mediators. Additionally, when the participants were told that the yogurt had a normal color and odor, or that it had been stored in accordance with best practices, their intention to eat it rose significantly. These findings enhance our understanding of how food date labels affect consumer-level food waste, and provide insights that can aid the development of educational campaigns to reduce it.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effects of different isomalt concentrations on the quality of wheat flour dough and spicy wheat gluten sticks (SWGS) were evaluated at the physical, structural and molecular levels. The results showed that the radial expansion rate (RER) and oil absorption rate (OAR) of SWGS increased first and then decreased with increased isomalt supplementation, which reached the maximum at 3 wt%. The pasting properties of wheat starch also changed, and the peak viscosity, breakdown and setback were decreased with the addition of isomalt. Dynamic rheological properties results showed that the storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G) increased with the addition of isomalt, which may be attributed to the reinforcement of gluten network structure by hydrogen bonding of isomalt. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images illustrated that the SWGS surface becomes smooth and the broken gluten structure was reduced after the addition of different isomalt levels compared with the control group. Overall, the wheat flour dough quality analysis showed that the addition of isomalt could generate a close binding with wheat starch and protein and further strengthen the internal structure of gluten through isomalt hydrogen bonds. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	4	2310	2320	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15582					FSTA:2022-07-Mq3736

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The physicochemical properties of the hydrophilic peptides (HIPs) and the hydrophobic peptides (HOPs) from the oyster protein hydrolysates (OPHs) were analysed. The technology of high-performance liquid chromatography and dynamic light scattering was used to determine the molecular weights and the particle sizes of HIP and HOP. About 60-70% of them had a molecular weight below 500Da and the particle size was all about 100nm, which were smaller than OPH. Furthermore, compared with OPH and HIP, HOPs have obvious advantages in surface hydrophobic and emulsifying properties because they have more hydrophobic groups on the surface. The emulsifying activity and emulsion stability of HOP can be significantly improved from 3.80 to 42.88m2g-1 and 131.17-163.70min, respectively, because of its high surface hydrophobicity. Thus, our results suggest that HOPs have a great potential to be developed as an emulsifier. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	5	2611	2618	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15090					FSTA:2022-08-Re3166
J		Ziyi Cheng; Xiaoli He; Zufang Wu; Peifang Weng							Improving the viability of powdered Lactobacillus fermentum Lf01 with complex lyoprotectants by maintaining cell membrane integrity and regulating related genes.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this study, Lactobacillus fermentum Lf01, which was screened out in the early stage of the experiment, had better fermentation performance as the research objectives, and was prepared into powder by vacuum freeze-drying technology. We used response surface methodology to optimize the composition of the mixture used to protect powdered L. fermentum. Our data demonstrated that 10% skim milk, 12% sucrose, 0.767% tyrosine, and 2.033% sorbitol ensured the highest survival rate (92.7%) of L. fermentum. We have initially explored the potential mechanism of the complex protectants through the protection effect under the electron microscope, and the analysis methods of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and transcriptomics. The complex protectants could effectively maintain the permeability barrier and structural integrity of cell membrane and avoid the leakage of cell contents. Transcriptomic data have also indicated that the protective effect of the complex protectants on bacteria during freeze-drying was most likely achieved through the regulation of related genes. We identified 240 differential genes in the treatment group, including 231 up-regulated genes and 9 down-regulated genes. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto encyclopaedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) analyses of differential expression genes (DEGs) indicated that genes involved in amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, membrane transport, fatty acid biosynthesis and cell growth were significantly up-regulated. These new results provided novel insights into the potential mechanism of lyoprotectants at the cellular level, morphological level, and gene level of the bacteria. Practical applications. In our study, a strain of Lactobacillus fermentum Lf01 with good fermentation performance was selected to be prepared into powder by freeze-drying technique. Bacterial cells were unavoidably damaged during the freeze-drying process. As a result, we investigated the protective effects on L. fermentum of ten distinct freeze-dried protectants and their mixtures. We were also attempting to explain the mechanism of action of the complex protectants at the cellular level, morphological level, and gene level of the bacteria. This presents very important theoretical and practical significance for the preservation of strains and the production of commercial direct-investment starter. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	8			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14181					FSTA:2022-12-Ad22322
J		Ziyi Deng; Liyun Yao; Min Fang; Yongning Wu; Zhiyong Gong							Health risk assessment using in vitro simulation in assessing bioavailability of cadmium in rice from main producing areas across China.		Journal of Food Science					Rice is a recognized source of cadmium (Cd) exposure. In this study, a total of 102 rice samples were obtained from main producing rice regions of China, and the bioavailability of Cd in rice were assessed by using an in vitro digestion method combined with a Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The results revealed that the average (range of) concentration of Cd in the rice samples was 0.2840 (0.0123-2.4710) mg/kg, and the average (range of) bioavailability of Cd in the rice samples was 23.94% (7.47-39.73%). We analyzed the recent rice consumption data and calculated the target hazard quotients (THQs) to evaluate the noncarcinogenic health risk of Cd in rice consumption for adults and children, respectively. We suggested that the most of investigated regions showed low risks of Cd in rice for general population, and the regions of Cd in rice near the limit deserves might be attracted more attention after taking bioavailability into account. Practical Application. The cadmium content of rice itself will affect its corresponding bioavailability to a certain extent. By studying the in vitro bioavailability of cadmium rice with different pollution levels, it is helpful for the dose selection of animal experiments or toxicity tests, and finally, we may provide some references for the establishment of appropriate treatment scheme of rice Cd poisoning. © 2022 Institute of Food Technologists.										2022	87	6	2766	2774	1750-3841				10.1111/1750-3841.16158					FSTA:2022-10-Me6066

Orah).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to investigate the effects of 1-methylcyclopropylene (1-MCP) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments on the postharvest tangerine variety Orah. The whole fruit was treated separately with 0.6mul/L 1-methylcyclopropylene and 20mg/L abscisic acid. The fruit was subjected to texture analysis, whereas fruit peel was obtained for microstructure observation. Correlation and principal component analyses showed that 1-MCP treatment could maintain a good peel texture. ABA treatment accelerated fruit senescence and caused the deterioration of the textural properties of the fruit. The data showed that 1-MCP treatment maintained the integrity and compactness of the peel structure. The peel of the fruit treated with 1-methylcyclopropylene also had a uniform thickness after storing at ambient temperature for 20 days. The peel tissue of fruit treated with ABA was more prone to collapse and structural disorder. These findings suggested that 1-methylcyclopropylene treatment was an effective way to prevent the deterioration of Orah tangerines. Novelty impact statement. This study compared the effect of 1-methylcyclopropylene (1-MCP) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments on the postharvest tangerine variety Orah. The changes in texture and ultrastructure of the Orah tangerine during the postharvest storage were the first studied tangerine variety. 1-MCP maintained the texture characteristic and delayed softening of the Orah tangerine, whereas ABA treatment accelerated the fruit ripening and senescence. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16633					FSTA:2022-11-Jc15537

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Molecular docking is a powerful tool that visualises interactions between receptors and ligands. This technique and experimental studies were used to explore the adsorption effects of soy hull polysaccharides (SHP) on bile acids (BAs). Docking sites and interactions between SHP and six BAs (deoxycholic acid, lycholic acid, taurine cholic acid, chenodeoxycholic acid, glycocholic acid and glycodesoxycholic acid) were identified by molecular docking. The docking sites were mainly O and H atoms, and interaction forces were mainly facilitated by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, with hydrogen bonds being the main bond type. BAs-binding studies, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and zeta potential results showed that hydrogen bonding was the main force mediating SHP and BAs adsorption. The hydrogen bonding was positively proportional to the adsorption capacity of BAs and negatively proportional to the absolute value of zeta potential. The molecular dynamic simulation of glycocholic acid and SHP was also performed. Hydrogen bond spacing and root mean square deviation analyses indicated that the glycocholic acid and SHP combination was stable. This study has the significance of preventing cardiovascular diseases by revealing the adsorption effects of SHP on bile acids BAs. © 2022 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2022	57	6	3702	3712	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15695					FSTA:2022-09-Jn12015

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					During the postharvest storage of broccoli, yellowing becomes a problem that affects the nutritional value and market value of broccoli. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) on chlorophyll degradation in postharvest broccoli. Broccoli heads were immersed in 100 mgL-1 ClO2 solution and then stored at 4°C for 25 days. The results showed that postharvest ClO2 treatment delayed the yellowing of broccoli, suppressed weight loss and relative electrical conductivity, and increased total soluble solid content, indicating that ClO2 treatment could delay the decline of broccoli quality. At the same time, ClO2 treatment also reduced the loss of chlorophyll content and suppressed chlorophyllase (CLH), pheophyllase (PPH) and pheophyllase a oxygenase (PAO) activity, which in turn inhibited the expression of BoCLH1, BoCLH2, BoCLH3, BoPPH, and BoPAO. In summary, the results indicated that ClO2 treatment could delay the yellowing rate and maintain the commercial value of broccoli during storage. Novelty impact statement. Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) treatment can delay yellowing and maintain the commercial value of broccoli. ClO2 treatment inhibited chlorophyll degrading enzyme activity in harvested broccoli. ClO2 treatment can downregulate the expression of chlorophyll degradation gene in harvested broccoli. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16985					FSTA:2023-03-Jq4528

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Chilling injury (CI) of banana represents a serious problem constraining postharvest preservation in the industry. Application of ethylene was found to efficiently attenuate CI of banana, however, the mechanism of which remains to be investigated. Here, we found that application of ethrel could ameliorate the CI of banana, as evidenced by lower CI index, electrolytic leakage and malondialdehyde content. Meanwhile, expression of phosphatidic acid (PA) formation genes MaPLDdelta1, MaPLDdelta5 and MaDGK2, as well as two transcriptional regulators MabHLH060 and MabHLH183 was significantly increased with the progression of CI, but decreased under ethrel treatment. MabHLH060 and MabHLH183 were shown to locate in nucleus and have transactivation ability. Importantly, these two transcriptional regulators MabHLH060/183 recognized the E-box elements in the promoters of MaPLDdelta1, MaPLDdelta5 and MaDGK2, and promoted their transcription. Together, these findings suggest that ethylene-alleviated CI of banana may involve the MabHLH060/183 module in modulating the expression of PA formation genes.

J		Ziyu Gan; Wen Zhang; Muhammad Arslan; Xuetao Hu; Xinai Zhang; Zhihua Li; Jiyong Shi; Xiaobo Zou							Ratiometric fluorescent metal-organic framework biosensor for ultrasensitive detection of acrylamide.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Acrylamide is a neurotoxin and carcinogen that forms during the thermal processing of food, inflicting irreversible harm to human health. Herein, a ratiometric fluorescence biosensor based on a 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled aptamer (FAM-ssDNA) and porphyrin metal-organic framework (PCN-224) was developed. PCN-224 exhibits strong adsorption capacity for FAM-ssDNA and also quenches the fluorescence of FAM-ssDNA via fluorescence resonance energy transfer and photoinduced electron transfer. FAM-ssDNA hybridizes with complementary DNA to form double-stranded DNA (FAM-dsDNA), which is liberated from the PCN-224 surface, resulting in fluorescence recovery. However, the intrinsic fluorescence of the ligand remains unchanged. Acrylamide can create an adduct with FAM-ssDNA and inhibit the hybridization of FAM-dsDNA, thus realizing ratiometric sensing of acrylamide. The proposed biosensor displays excellent detection performance from 10 nM~0.5mM with a limit of detection of 1.9 nM. In conclusion, a fabricated biosensor was successfully applied to detect acrylamide in thermally processed food, and the results were consistent with those of high-performance liquid chromatography.										2022	70	32	10065	10074	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04756					FSTA:2022-12-Cf4240

Journal of Functional Foods					Obesity-associated skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction contributed to exercise capacity decline. 5-heptadecylresorcinol (AR-C17) has been proven effective against obesity and insulin resistance. However, its effects on skeletal muscle performance remains unclear. In this study, we investigate whether AR-C17 could protect against high-fat diet induced C57 BL/6J mice skeletal muscle dysfunction. The results indicated that AR-C17 intervention significantly improved skeletal muscle exercise capacity according to the strength and endurance test. AR-C17 showed no effect on skeletal muscle myofiber type conversion and myogenesis, but could significantly enhance PGC-1alpha mediated mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, AR-C17 significantly attenuated PA-induced reduction of mitochondrial DNA content in C2C12 cells and promoted mitochondrial biogenesis regulator gene PGC-1alpha and its downstream signaling pathway protein expression. In addition, AR-C17 increased the protein levels of SIRT3, while the protective effect was abolished by SIRT3 inhibitor (3-TYP), indicating AR-C17 ameliorated obesity induced skeletal muscle dysfunction might through SIRT3/PGC-1alpha signaling pathway.

J		Ziyue Wang; Hui Liu; Lu Li; Yucai Li; Haiyang Yan; Yuan Yuan							Modulation of disordered bile acid homeostasis and hepatic tight junctions using salidroside against hepatocyte apoptosis in furan-induced mice.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Furan, a processing-induced food contaminant, has attracted great attention due to its hepatotoxicity. To further investigate the underlying mechanism of salidroside (SAL) alleviating furan-induced liver damage, we divided Balb/c mice into the control group, the furan (8mg/kg/day) group, and three groups of three different doses of SAL (10/20/40mg/kg/day) in the current research. The shifted serum profile was observed through untargeted metabonomics, to which the bile acid metabolism was related, and the alleviating effect of SAL against furan-induced apoptosis was caused by the metabolism. Target bile acid quantification for the liver and serum showed that SAL positively regulated the homeostasis of bile acids disturbed by furan. Meanwhile, SAL significantly upregulated the synthesis genes of bile acids (Cyp7a1, Cyp7b1, Cyp8b1, and Cyp27a1) and the uptake transport genes (Ntcp and Oatps) and downregulated the efflux transport genes (Bsep, Ost-alpha, Ost-beta, Mrp2, and Mrp4). Transmission electron microscopy of the bile canaliculi and tight junctions and the levels of tight junction marker proteins (ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1) confirmed that the disruption of the hepatic tight junction was inhibited by SAL. The connection between the apoptosis-and tight junction-related proteins was observed through the construction of a protein-protein interaction network. SAL suppressed the furan-induced hepatocyte apoptosis evidenced by the detection of TUNEL and Bax, Bcl-2, and caspase-3 levels. Taken together, SAL alleviated furan-induced hepatocyte apoptosis via altering the disordered homeostasis of bile acids and hepatic tight junctions.										2022	70	32	10031	10043	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c04654					FSTA:2022-12-Cf4239
J		Ziyun Yan; Honggao Liu; Tao Li; Jieqing Li; Yuanzhong Wang							Two dimensional correlation spectroscopy combined with ResNet: efficient method to identify bolete species compared to traditional machine learning.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Different species of bolete have different nutritional and medicinal value, which leads to the phenomenon of shoddy in the market from time to time. Therefore, consumers need a fast and effective detection method to identify their species. In this paper, different data pretreatment was carried out for the Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectra, and the modeling results of partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), support vector machines (SVM) and residual neural network (ResNet) were compared. The results show that PLS-DA and SVM models need a suitable combination of pretreatment for spectral data. The purpose is to improve the accuracy of the model and avoid over fitting. After spectral pretreatment, the accuracy of PLS-DA model were improved to 99.63% and 97.38% respectively. In order to ensure that the SVM model does not have the risk of over fitting, the accuracy of the SVM model after pretreatment were reduced to 98.5% and 93.63%. The ResNet model was established based on the original spectrum. The accuracy of the model was 100%, and there is no over fitting phenomenon, which is one of the advantages of the model. Comparing the above three models, ResNet is the best model for bolete species identification.

J		Zizi Hu; Xiaomei Sha; Lu Zhang; Sheng Huang; Zongcai Tu							Effect of grass carp scale collagen peptide FTGML on cAMP-PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in b16f10 melanoma cells and correlation between anti-melanin and antioxidant properties.		Foods					Peptide Phe-Thr-Gly-Met-Leu (FTGML) is a bioactive oligopeptide with tyrosinase inhibitory activity derived from gelatin hydrolysate of grass carp scales. Previous studies have shown that FTGML addition can effectively inhibit mushroom tyrosinase activity in vitro, and also has some effect on the inhibition of melanogenesis in zebrafish in vivo, but the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In this study, we used FTGML to treat B16F10 melanoma cells, and found a significant inhibition of tyrosinase activity and melanin synthesis. Interestingly, the treatment showed a strong correlation between antioxidant activity and anti-melanin, which was associated with FTGML reducing the involvement of reactive oxygen species in melanin synthesis. Furthermore, FTGML reduced melanogenesis in B16F10 cells by downregulating the cAMP-PI3K/Akt and MAPK pathways (p38 and JNK). These results suggested that FTGML can reduce melanin production in mouse B16F10 melanoma cells through multiple pathways. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zobkova, Z. S.; Lazareva, E. G.; Semipyatniy, V. K.							Methodological approach to designing fermented dairy products with optimal biological value.		Foods					The development of food products implies ensuring the optimal composition and ratio of the basic components, as well as their technological compatibility. A priori, the quality of raw materials, the optimal formula of the product and the efficiency of the technological process determine the quality of products, including biological value. The use of whole-cell sensors such as infusoria Tetrahymena pyriformis is most productive for screening biological studies. At present, for a comprehensive assessment there are no data on the use of simplest technology of fermented dairy products and the design of their biological value. The purpose of this research is to develop a methodology for creating whole-milk products of optimal biological value using the express method of biotesting. The research object was yogurt with the ratio of the mass fraction of fat and protein in the range of 0.36 / 1.5, sucrose in the range of 5 / 10%. An express method for determining the relative biological value of fermented dairy products using test organisms and an original methodology for creating whole-milk products of optimal biological value have been developed. A software has been developed to calculate formula of the product optimized for the following indicators: the relative biological value of the product, the cost of raw material and basic materials. The methodology is a tool to assist industry organizations in improving production technologies and quality management systems. © 2022 by the authors.

On-line coupling of supercritical fluid extraction with enantioselective supercritical fluid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry for the determination of chiral pesticides in hemp seeds: a proof-of-principle study.		Food Chemistry					The present research can be considered as a proof-of-principle study focused on the determination of chiral pesticides using a supercritical fluid extraction instrument coupled on-line with an enantioselective supercritical fluid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. To the best of Authors" knowledge, this is the first description of an on-line approach for the extraction and determination of chiral pesticides. Metalaxyl, benalaxyl and dimethenamid were investigated in nine hemp seed samples belonging to four varieties of Cannabis sativa; only in one case a pesticide was found at levels above the method limit of quantification (LoQ), though within the EU maximum residue level value. The figures-of-merit determined were linearity, precision, limit of detection (LoD), and LoQ. Regression coefficients were between 0.9856 and 0.9973, the LoDs were in the 0.04-0.41 mug kg-1 range, the LoQs were in the 0.12-1.38 mug kg-1 range, while coefficients of variation were between 1 and 3% (10 mug kg-1 level).

Food Research International					The physicochemical features of mung bean protein (MBP) and adzuki bean protein (ABP) hydrolysates derived from Alcalase (MBPHA, ABPHA) and Flavourzyme (MBPHF, ABPHF) were assessed using FTIR, hydrophobicity, emulsion activity, zeta potential, and health-promoting activities. The results proved that the choice of peptidase and substrate both have a significant effect on the hydrolysates in different physicochemical, structural and functional properties. Size exclusion-HPLC was used to fractionate the MBP and ABP hydrolysates. The results demonstrated that Alcalase hydrolysates included smaller peptides than Flavourzyme hydrolysates, and the chromatogram patterns of the two peptidases were similar. The peptides with the most potent antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory properties were identified using MALDI-TOF-MS. The fraction (F4) of MBPHA exhibited the highest levels of metal chelating activity. The Flavourzyme hydrolysates fraction (F2) and the ABPHA fraction (F2) showed the highest ABTS radical scavenging activity and ACE-inhibitory activity, respectively. Pro-Pro was identified in peptide sequences with ABTS radical scavenging activity as an active component while Pro-Gln was identified in peptide sequences with ACE-inhibitory activity. As a result, Pro-Pro and Pro-Gln, respectively, are likely-one of the characteristics of antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory peptides from MBP and ABP. Compared to mung bean and adzuki bean protein as substrate, Alcalase and Flavourzyme as peptidases significant impacted the development of distinct functionalities and biological activities.

J		Zohreh Nasrollahi; Kahin ShahaniPour; Ramesh Monajemi; Mohammad Ahadi, A.							Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench improved blood glucose, lipid, and down-regulated PPAR-alpha, PTP1B genes expression in diabetic rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Okra (Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench) is one of the most important medicinal plants for the treatment of diabetes. Flavonoids are one of the most significant components of okra and are responsible for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic effects. The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of okra extract on biochemical parameters and expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B(PTP1B) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) genes in a model of streptozotocin-induced diabetic male Wistar rat. Rats were given oral dosages of okra extract, (75% ethanolic extract) (200-400 mg/kg) for eight weeks. Our findings indicate that okra extract and quercetin therapy may lower blood glucose (BS), insulin, Triglyceride (TG), Cholesterol (Cho), and glucose transporter protein type-4 (GLUT4) levels. PTP1B and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha(PPAR-alpha), which are important regulators of glucose and lipid homeostasis, are similarly inhibited by okra extract. According to the findings, okra extract also has antioxidant properties. Our results support the anti-hyperglycemic and hypolipidemic properties of okra extract. As a result, it appears to play a crucial role in controlling diabetes. Practical applications. In this paper, we show that flavonoids in okra may help diabetes by inhibiting the PTP1B and PPAR-pathways. This is significant because little research has been done on the impact of flavonoid chemicals in A. esculentus on the expression of PTP1B and PPAR using traditional methods of diabetes treatment. Many of today's essential drugs (e.g., atropine, ephedrine, tubocurarine, digoxin, and reserpine) have been developed by studding traditional treatments. Plant-derived medications are still used as a prototype by chemists in an effort to develop more effective and less risky treatments (e.g., morphine, taxol, physostigmine, quinidine, and emetine). © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.14097					FSTA:2022-11-Jq14698

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					A simple, fast, and efficient method of vortex assisted magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction for separation and pre-concentration of erythromycin in chicken samples prior to high LC-UV determination has been developed. The novel heterogeneous CeZrO2 nanoparticles doped magnetic graphene oxide, for use as an efficient nanosorbent, was synthetised and applied for the adsorption of erythromycin. The synthetised nanosorbent was characterised using both Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR) and energy dispersive X-Ray (EDX) spectroscopy together with field emission scanning electron microscopy-EDX. To obtain the best extraction condition and maximum extraction efficiency of erythromycin, the effect of important parameters including pH, amount of sorbent, vortexing time, ionic strength, sample volume, and desorption conditions were investigated. At optimum conditions, a linear range of 0.25-300 g kg-1, LOD (S/N = 3) of 0.079 g kg-1, and LOQ (S/N = 10) of 0.270 g kg-1 were obtained. The precision of the method was established as having an RSD (%) at 100 g kg-1 of erythromycin for seven replicates of 2.6% and 3.2% for the intra-day and the inter-day, respectively. Recoveries over 94.0% confirmed a high capability of the proposed method for separation and determination of erythromycin residues in chicken being one of the most important animal products. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2022	39	9	1521	1530	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2022.2096929					FSTA:2022-12-Sn6687

Journal of Food Biochemistry					The compounds in volatile flavor substances in duck meats of three different body parts (breast, leg, and wing) were extracted by headspace solid-phase micro-extraction and determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 16main volatile compounds including 4 hydrocarbons, 4 alcohols, 2 acids, 3 aldehydes, and 3 others (N-containing, S-containing) were identified in raw duck meats from three different body parts. The hydrocarbon compounds account for more than 50% of all volatile substances in all three body parts. And the percentage of hydrocarbon compounds in raw duck breast meat reaches 82.76%. A total of 81 volatile compounds including 15 hydrocarbons, 10 alcohols, 7 acids, 12 aldehydes, 4 esters, 19 S-containing and N-containing compounds, and 14 others were isolated and identified in 1 hr-marinated and cooked duck meats. A total of 101 kinds of volatile flavor compounds including 13 hydrocarbons, 14 alcohol, 7 acids, 8 aldehydes, 12 esters, 23 S-containing and N-containing compounds, and 24 others were detected in 3 hr-marinated duck meats of the three body parts. It was proved in this study that under the same conditions, the volatile compounds in duck legs are more than those in duck breasts and wings, and the types of volatile flavor substances increase significantly in duck meats after cooked. Practical applications. Prepared and cooked duck meat, especially wings and legs are popular food in China. The results suggest that Pickling makes duck meat more flavory while proper pickling time is less than 3 hr. Duck wings are better for marinating and cooking compared with duck breasts and legs. The acceptance study of duck meat from different body parts and the analysis of volatile flavor compounds are beneficial for optimizing utilization of whole parts of duck meat. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	6			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13908					FSTA:2022-10-Sn5253

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					N-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinone-substituted flavan-3-ols (EPSFs) were prepared by an in vitro model reaction, and the taste thresholds of EPSFs and their dose-over-threshold factors in large-leaf yellow tea (LYT) were investigated. The effects of initial reactant ratios, reaction temperatures and time, pH values, and water addition on the yield of EPSFs were explored. The contents of EPSFs during roasting were determined by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). When the initial ratio of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) to theanine was 1:2 and roasted under 120°C for 120min, the contents of EPSFs were the highest. The bitterness and astringency thresholds of four EPSF isomers were measured by the half-tongue method, of which EPSF2 and EPSF3 had higher thresholds than EGCG. In LYT, four EPSFs had lower bitterness and astringency dose-over-threshold factors than EGCG. This study suggested that the reduction of bitterness and astringency of tea after roasting may be mainly due to the formation of EPSFs.										2022	70	12	3832	3841	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.2c00798					FSTA:2022-07-Hn6758

Food Research International					Acrylamide (AA) is a common food contaminant that causes glucose metabolism disorders (GMD). However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Female Sprague Dawley (SD) rats were treated with AA via gavage for 21 days, and the glucose and insulin levels, gut microbiota, intestinal barrier, and metabolism were analyzed. The results revealed that AA elevated serum glucose levels, reduced insulin levels and caused intestinal barrier injury. The 16S amplicon sequencing and non-targeted metabolomics showed that AA induced gut microbiota dysbiosis and bile acids (BAs) metabolism disorder. Specifically, AA decreased the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bacteroides in the cecal contents, and increased the cholic acid (CA) content in feces. Meanwhile, the expression of ileum apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) responsible for CA reabsorption was suppressed. Further analysis indicated that BAs sensing nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) gene was activated and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) which stimulates insulin secretion was downregulated. In addition, activation of FXR increased the expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 (FGF15), which resulted in the inhibition of hepatic BAs synthesis. Overall, this study demonstrated that AA-induced GMD is associated with the gut-microbiota-CA-FXR/GLP-1 axis. These findings add new knowledge to the AA-induced GMD and provide a basis for potential AA toxicity mitigation by manipulation of the gut microbiota.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Food-borne pathogens and biofilm formation pose a serious threat to seafood safety. The objective of this study was to evaluate the inactivation effect of electron beam irradiation on the suspension and biofilms of Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus), Pseudomonas fluorescens (P. fluorescens), and Shewanella putrefaciens (S. putrefaciens) in vitro and on the surface of large croaker and the possible mechanisms of action. The results showed that electron beam irradiation could significantly reduce the number of viable bacteria both in vitro and on the surface of the large yellow croaker samples and could destroy the extracellular polymers (EPS) of biofilms. Mechanism studies showed that the increased Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels after irradiation treatment resulted in damage to the plasma membrane of bacterial cells, while the cell wall was intact. In addition, the nucleic acids of the bacteria were significantly damaged after irradiation, but the primary protein structure was not changed. These findings provide the internal mechanism of the effect of electron beam irradiation on Gram-negative bacteria and indicate that electron beam irradiation could be used as an effective method to control spoilage bacteria and pathogenic bacteria biofilms on the surface of seafood.

In this study, high-quality cultivar (HH) had better pasting properties among all other cultivars in D treatment. DHH supported higher short-branch chain amylopectin to develop the crystalline regions. Besides, DHH increased C16:0, C16:1, C18:1, C18:2, glutamate, aspartate, lysine, and threonine, and reduced glutelin and prolamine levels in head rice. Higher pasting properties in DHH was also supported by higher CO in esters and ketones, CO in carboxylic acid, esters, alcohols, and ethers, OH in alcohols before pasting and lower CO and CO in carboxylic acid, CO in aldehydes, and CO, CO and OH in carboxylic acid after pasting.

Food Chemistry					Novel films based on watermelon peel pectin (WMP) incorporated with purple cabbage extract (PCE) were developed for monitoring the freshness of mutton. The FTIR result showed that WMP and PCE interacted through hydrogen bonds. Low PCE content (≤ 1.5%) could be well dispersed in the film matrix, resulting in an enhancement in light transmittance, mechanical properties, barrier properties, and thermal stability. Excessive addition of PCE destroyed the compact structure of the film and decreased the comprehensive properties. The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of WMP/PCE films were proportional to the amount of incorporated PCE. Moreover, the color of the film deepened as the PCE content increased. The film had excellent color stability and pH response properties. The WMP/PCE1.5 film color varied from mauve to baby blue according to the quality of mutton (fresh to spoiled). Our results suggested that the WMP/PCE film might have great potential for monitoring the freshness of mutton.

Food Chemistry					The effects of dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma treatment on the physicochemical properties of potato starch and its films were studied. The results showed that the plasma species caused etching lead to small cracks and pores in potato starch particles and that oxidation, de-polymerization, and crosslinking were the main mechanisms underlying the effects of DBD plasma treatment. As the treatment time extended, starch hydrolysis, turbidity, syneresis, and gelatinization temperatures increased first and then decreased, whereas the solubility, swelling power, and water absorption significantly increased (P< 0.05). There was a decrease in the retrogradation tendency of the starch gels. The surfaces of the DBD plasma-modified potato starch-based films were relatively flat. After a 9-min treatment, the films exhibited the lowest water vapor permeability and highest tensile strength. In conclusion, the use of DBD plasma is a simple and green method to enhance the properties of potato starch and its film.

Food Science and Biotechnology					Diabetes mellitus, associated with alpha-glucosidase, has been considered as a chronic metabolic disorder, seriously affecting human health. Thus, searching natural alpha-glucosidase inhibitors and investigating their inhibition mechanism are urgently important. In this study, sixty-two essential oils (EOs), derived from aromatic plants, were found to exert different inhibition on alpha-glucosidase. The further study revealed that the most potent EOs against alpha-glucosidase were chuan-xiong, fructus cnidii, sacha inchi, aloe, Ganoderma lucidum spore and ginger with IC50 values of 3.02, 2.88, 7.37, 5.06, 5.32 and 7.40 mug/mL. Moreover, the inhibitory mechanism and kinetics studies found that chuan-xiong and sacha inchi were reversible and mixed-type inhibitors. Fructus cnidii, aloe, Ganoderma lucidum spore and ginger were reversible and uncompetitive-type inhibitors. It is suggested that EOs, being of natural origin, would be promising anti-alpha-glucosidase agents. ©The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2022.										2022	31	12	1593	1602	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-022-01145-5					FSTA:2023-02-Te0674

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Some soil microorganisms can mobilize unavailable phosphorus (P) in soils for plant use and increase P fertilizer efficiency. Thus, an abiotic P solubilization experiment and fungal incubation in solution and soil were conducted to investigate the mobilization of various P compounds by a new white-rot fungus Ceriporia lacerata HG2011. The crop agronomic performances were then evaluated in the winter barley-summer maize-winter wheat rotation field. Results. Ceriporia lacerata HG2011 had a wide P mobilization spectrum and mobilized P by different mechanisms depending on P sources supplied in liquid culture. The chief mechanism employed by this fungus was the production of protons in mobilizing Ca3 (PO4)2, low-molecular-weight organic acids and other unknown substances in FePO4 and AlPO4, phytase (an inducible enzyme in the presence of phytate) in phytate, and phosphatase in lecithin and ribonucleic acid, respectively. As a result of the large fungal biomass, P accumulated in the hypha should also be considered in the assessment of the fungal P mobilization, and not just only soluble inorganic P. As C. lacerata HG2011 colonized on and in the test soil, phosphatase and phytase activities were enhanced but pH decreased in the soil, leading to P mobilization. The application of this fungus mobilized soil P, increased crop P uptake and yields, and consecutively reduced P fertilizer use without yield sacrifices in the multiple crop rotation field. Conclusion. C. lacerata HG2011 showed a new use with respect to mobilizing soil P and reducing P fertilizer input in modern agriculture beyond medical purposes, environmental protection and biofuel production. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	102	4	1640	1650	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11501					FSTA:2022-06-Ma3046

L. plantarum AR113 harbors a C30 carotenoid operon crtNM based on genomic analysis, but the yield of C30 carotenoid is only 8.1mug g-1 DCW. Results. To improve the productivity of C30 carotenoid, crtNM from L. plantarum AR113 was cloned and reconstructed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). The proteins crtN and crtM were successfully expressed based on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis, and the carotenoid was detected using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). In comparison with the constitutive promoter P44, the use of the inducible T7 promoter significantly increased the carotenoid content in E. coli. The fermentation conditions were also optimized with induction by 0.5mmol/L IPTG at 20°C for 7 h. The yield of C30 carotenoid reached 154.5mug g-1 DCW, which was 18-fold higher than that of L. plantarum AR113. The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6sulfonic acid (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity of C30 carotenoids synthesized by heterologous expression in E. coli was also higher than that of the antioxidant food additive butylated hydroxytoluene. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that E. coli has strong potential as a basic chassis for the production of C30 carotenoids from Lactiplantibacillus with high antioxidant activity. © 2022 Society of Chemical Industry.										2022	103	2	506	513	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.12160					FSTA:2023-03-Ba0583

P.; Yaqi Cao; Xiaolan Du; Tianran Huang; Yiqun Cheng; Ming Huang							Meat quality and flavor evaluation of Nanjing water boiled salted duck (NWSD) produced by different Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) ingredients.		Food Chemistry					Reports on meat quality and flavor evaluation of Nanjing water boiled salted duck (NWSD) produced by different Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata) ingredients are limited. To select a suitable Muscovy duck ingredient for the NWSD processing, six kinds of NWSD products were produced using female (65, 70, and 75 days) and male (75, 80, and 85 days) Muscovy duck ingredients. The meat quality, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), smell and taste were investigated by using colorimeter, texture analyzer, headspace-gas chromatography-ion mobility spectroscopy (HS-GC-IMS), electronic nose (E-nose), electronic tongue (E-tongue), etc. Results exhibited that 32 iconic VOCs were obtained by using partial least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA), principal component analysis (PCA), and variable importance projection (VIP) methods. 80-day-old male Muscovy duck showed moderate moisture and protein content, good meat texture and bright color, diverse iconic VOCs and clear differentiation, making it the preferred ingredient for NWSD processing.

J		Zongyuan Han; Xiqing Yue; Jun-Hua Shao							The adsorption characteristics of 2D fibril and 3D hydrogel aggregates at the O/W interface combining molecular dynamics simulation.		Food Hydrocolloids					The 2D/3D microstructures and hydrophobic domains of interfacial proteins play important roles in interfacial adsorption and emulsification stability. The effects of spatial conformation, crystal structure and micro-structures on interfacial adsorption were investigated combining molecular dynamics simulation. The results showed that with the increase of pH s, the alpha-helix contents and surface hydrophobicity in the emulsified aggregates decreased significantly, and the beta-sheet contents increased significantly, in which the formation of interfacial protein membrane caused molecular re-arrangement. The alpha-helix contents and surface hydrophobicity in 2D fibril aggregates were significantly higher than those in 3D hydrogel aggregates, but the beta-sheet result was opposite along with different hydrophobic amino acid sequences. The peak intensity and crystallinity of interfacial proteins in hydrogel aggregation mode were higher than those in fibril aggregation mode, and the transformation of crystal structure can affect the interfacial microstructure. The interfacial protein membrane is mainly composed of fibrous rod-like aggregates, among which 2D fibrous network structure is formed at pH 3.0 and 3D multilayer network structure is formed at pH 9.0. Due to the differences in spatial conformation, crystal structure and characteristic micro-structure caused by emulsification and adsorption, the interfacial adsorption rate of 2D fibril aggregates is higher, and the ability of 3D hydrogel aggregates to reduce interfacial tension is greater.

J		Zor, M.; Sengul, M.; Karakutuk, I. A.; Odunkiran, A.							Changes caused by different cooking methods in some physicochemical properties, antioxidant activity, and mineral composition of various vegetables.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, it is aimed to determine how different cooking processes (boiled (B), steamed (S), pressure boiled (PB), and pressure steamed (PS)) cause changes in various vegetables (potato, carrot, beet root, black carrot, celery, turnip, and sweet potato). The different process had a very significant effect (p<0.01) on the L*, a*, b*, C*, H°, dry matter content, total soluble solids (TSS), ash content, pH, and titratable acidity values of vegetables. The process and vegetable kind were found to have a very significant effect (p<0.01) on vitamin C and total phenolic content (TPC) of vegetables. It was revealed that the vitamin C was preserved better in S and PS than B vegetables. Except all PB, B, S sweet potato and cooked celery the TPC of other samples decreased at different rates (6.12%-88.30%) with cooking. It was found that the antioxidant activity (AA) of vegetables decreased with the process. It was determined that the mineral compositions of vegetables cooked with different methods were significantly different (p<0.01) from raw vegetables, except for Fe. A positive correlation was detected between the samples' AA and color values. As a result, it was revealed that S vegetables preserved their color values better and the AA values of S vegetables were closest to raw vegetables. Novelty Impact Statement. In terms of healthy nutrition, the differences in the characteristics of the food cooked with the heat treatment process in cooked foods has recently aroused an increasing interest. The study showed that physical and chemical properties, total phenolic content, and antioxidant properties were interrelated with different vegetables and different cooking methods. This was due to the different compositions and cooking techniques of vegetables, which determine the cell wall integrity and solubility of cell components during heat treatments. It was determined that the properties of steamed beetroot and black carrot were better preserved among different vegetables cooked with four different cooking methods (boiled, steamed, pressure boiled, and pressure steamed). The antioxidant activity of vegetables decreased with the treatment. Except for Fe, the mineral compositions of vegetables cooked by different methods were significantly different from raw vegetables. As a result, it was revealed that steamed vegetables preserved their color values better and the antioxidant activity values of steamed vegetables were closest to raw vegetables. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16960					FSTA:2023-03-Jh4511
J		Zor, M.; Sengul, M.							Possibilities of using extracts obtained from Rosa pimpinellifolia L. flesh and seeds in ice cream production.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, extracts were prepared from the flesh and seeds of Rosa pimpinellifolia L. Using different solvents and different extraction methods. Flesh pulp, seed powder, and the obtained extracts were added to the ice cream at 5%. Changes in some physical and chemical properties of the ice cream at the beginning and in the 2nd, 4th, and 6th months of storage were determined. It was found that the process had a very significant effect on dry matter content, pH value, titratable acidity, volume increase, complete melting time, L*, a*, b*, C, H°, and Delta E values, total phenolic content, and total monomeric anthocyanin content (p<.01). It was revealed that storage time had a very significant effect on dry matter content, pH value, titratable acidity, complete melting time, b* and C values, total phenolic content, and ABTS+ (p<.01). There was no change in the total content of monomeric anthocyanins during the storage period of ice cream samples. Novelty impact statement. Nowadays, the use of natural colorants has become widespread and artificial colorants are considered to cause harm to human health. Color and color stability in foods are important factors that determine consumer preference. The ways of obtaining anthocyanins, which give the red color, from many plants and their stability are currently being investigated. However, the growing conditions of these plants and the storage stability of the obtained natural colorant are commercially important. Anthocyanin-based extracts were obtained from the flesh and seeds of R. pimpinellifolia, acquired from a shrub that is naturally grown in Turkey and can meet its water needs with rainwater, and the possibilities of using anthocyanin-based extracts as natural colorants were investigated for the first time. It was concluded that the fruit and extracts of R. pimpinellifolia were a good commercial source of anthocyanins and could be used as a natural colorant due to their color stability during storage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2022	46	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16225					FSTA:2022-05-Pn2255

Feeding silkworm (Bombyx mori L.) oil to growing rabbits improves the fatty acid composition of meat, liver and perirenal fat.		Meat Science					Silkworm oil was used in a rabbit diet to evaluate its benefit on the fatty acid (FA) profile of different carcass portions. Two experimental diets were prepared: a control diet (commercial diet with 13 g/kg sunflower oil) and a silkworm oil diet (SWO) (commercial diet with 13 g/kg silkworm oil). Rabbits received the experimental diets the last three weeks before slaughter, which occurred at 10 weeks of age. At slaughter, hind leg meat, liver, and perirenal fat were sampled for FA profile analysis. The SWO diet significantly increased the n-3 FA of all three sampling sites and halved the n-6/ n-3 ratio of hind leg meat and perirenal fat. Furthermore, the liver of SWO rabbits was also richer in C22:6 n-3 compared to that of control rabbits. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that the total dietary replacement of sunflower oil with silkworm oil in fattening rabbits positively changed the FA profile of the considered carcass tissues.

Food Chemistry					This study constructed a novel biomimetic enzyme electrochemical biosensor based on tetraphenyl metalloporphyrins functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The effect of central metal ions on the catalytic activity of tetraphenyl metalloporphyrin biomimetic enzyme was investigated. It was found that the change of central metal ions had a significant effect on the catalytic performance of metalloporphyrin and Zinc(II) tetraphenylporphyrin (ZnTPP) had the most excellent catalytic property. The electrochemical behaviors of tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) on ZnTPP/MWCNTs modified electrode were investigated. It was found that the redox peak current was increased significantly, which was attributed to the redox peak current to the electrocatalytic activity of ZnTPP and the synergistic effect between ZnTPP and MWCNTs. A strong linear relationship was shown in the concentration range of 0.01 to 1000 muM. This electrochemical sensor also had excellent repeatability, storage, and interference resistance. This work provided a simple and sensitive method for the determination of TBHQ. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2022	388				0308-8146				10.1016/j.foodchem.2022.132898					FSTA:2022-09-Ne1971
J		Zu Jia Lee; Shi-Cheng Tong; Teck-Kim Tang; Yee-Ying Lee							Palm-based cellulose nanofiber isolated from mechano-chemical processing as sustainable rheological modifier in reduced fat mayonnaise.		Journal of Food Science					Reducing fat intake from our daily diet serves to be an effective way to combat the rising obesity issue worldwide. Hence, reducing fat content in mayonnaise, a high fat food product, is one of the primary trends in the food industry. To date, research on the use of nanocellulose, a new and emerging form of fat mimetic, in mayonnaise formulation remains limited. This study sets out to formulate reduced fat 5%, 15%, and 30% mayonnaise using varying concentration of nanocellulose synthesized from palm pressed fiber followed by a 20-day stability study. Nanocellulose was synthesized with particle size of 106.0 18.7 nm and zeta potential of -72.5 2.26mV. It was used as fat mimetic in mayonnaise. Rheological analysis conducted showed that incorporation of nanocellulose into reduced fat mayonnaise formulation was able to counteract the loss of viscosity in mayonnaise caused by fat content reduction. This finding was further supported by the smaller oil droplets that are closely packed in reduced fat mayonnaise formulation when viewed under light microscope. Nonetheless, significant oil droplet coalescence was found in reduced fat mayonnaise formulations during storage period which could lead to loss of viscosity. Taken together, these findings suggest that CNF was able to act as fat mimetic upon formulation of mayonnaise but the same cannot be said during long term storage of mayonnaise. Practical Application. We successfully isolated nanocellulose from palm biomass (palm pressed fiber) using green approach and used it as a fat replacer for preparation of 5%, 15%, and 30% reduced fat mayonnaise. A computation study revealed a strong binding affinity of the nanocellulose on the lipase active site essential to inhibit the digestion of fats and oils. Therefore, nanocellulose demonstrated a huge potential to be used as not only as fat replacer but also rheological modifier for the development of reduced fat or vegan foods. © 2022 The Authors.

J		Zu-Man Dou; Chun Chen; Xiong Fu; Rui-Hai Liu							A dynamic view on the chemical composition and bioactive properties of mulberry fruit using an in vitro digestion and fermentation model.		Food & Function					Mulberry is a kind of fruit rich in nutrients, however, the beneficial effects of mulberry fruits are related not only to the amount consumed, but also to the bioavailability of these nutrients in the organism. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the bioaccessibility of main bioactive compounds from mulberry fruit using an in vitro digestion model, the changes in bioactivities as well as intestinal flora were also investigated. The results showed that the particle size of the mulberry fruit was gradually reduced (from 196.87 to 60.85mum), as well as the phenolics and carbohydrates were significantly released during the digestion and maximized in the first 15min in the intestinal phase (1752 2.80mg GAE per 100g, DW; 277.402 2.80mg GE per 100g, DW, respectively). Meanwhile, the bioaccessibility indices for phenolic compounds and carbohydrates were 55.49% and 84.62%. The antioxidant activity and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory effect of the mulberry fruit were positively correlated with their total content of released phenolic compounds. And the phenolic compounds (2,4,6-trihydroxybenzoic acid, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid and gallic acid) were the main compounds that inhibit the alpha-glucosidase activity by binding to its active cavity through hydrogen bonds. In addition, the mulberry fruit undigested fractions could be further fermented by intestinal microorganisms to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which decreased the colon pH value (from 5.93 to 4.79) and the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio which was beneficial for obesity. Our results indicated that the mulberry fruit exhibited good bioactivity during digestion and fermentation, and could be a promising candidate as a dietary source of functional foods. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2022	13	7	4142	4157	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03505c					FSTA:2022-07-Jf9990

Mechanistic role of astaxanthin derived from shrimp against certain metabolic disorders.		Food Science & Nutrition					Oxidative stress caused by the imbalance between production of oxidants and antioxidants in the body leads to the development of different ailments. The bioactive compounds derived from marine sources are considered to be safe and appropriate to use. Astaxanthin possesses antioxidant activity about 100-500 times higher than other antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol and beta-carotene. It has numerous health benefits and vital pharmacological properties for the treatment of diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, heart disease, ischemia, neurological disorders, and potential role in liver enzyme gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase which has significance in medicine as a diagnostic marker. The primary source of astaxanthin among crustaceans is shrimps and the presence of astaxanthin protects shrimps from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. Conclusively, astaxanthin derived from shrimps is very effective against oxidative stress which can lead to certain ailments. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Zudi Li; Wenting Zhao; Yue Ma; Hao Liang; Dan Wang; Xiaoyan Zhao							Shifts in the bacterial community related to quality properties of vacuum-packaged peeled potatoes during storage.		Foods					To reveal the potential relationship between the bacterial community and quality attributes of vacuum-packaged peeled potatoes, the bacterial community dynamics, visual quality, organic acids, flavor and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during 12 days of storage under 10°C were studied, and a correlation analysis was performed between the bacterial community and VOCs. During the whole storage, the dominant bacteria changed from Ralstonia, Pseudomonas, Pantoea and Comamonas to Clostridia, Clostridium, Lacrimispora, Lactococcus and Leuconostoc. The visual quality and hardness deteriorated significantly on day 12; meanwhile, lactic and acetic acid content accumulated to 0.79 and 4.87mg/g FW, respectively. Potatoes' flavor deteriorated severely after 8 days, as evidenced by results of an electronic nose (e-nose). A total of 37 VOCs were detected, and the total content showed an increasing trend from 2164.85 to 10658.68mug/kg during the whole storage. A correlation analysis showed that Enterobacteriaceae, Erwinia, Lacrimispora, Lactococcus, Serratia, Pantoea, Clostridium, Flavobacterium and Clostridia were positively correlated with the biosynthesis of VOCs. In addition, 10 spoilage markers were screened according to a variable importance in projection (VIP) ≥ 1. Ethanol, which was the most abundant spoilage marker, was significantly related to Enterobacteriaceae, Erwinia, Lacrimispora and Lactococcus. The results of this study have great practical significance for prolonging the shelf life of fresh-cut agricultural produce. © 2022 by the authors.

European Food Research and Technology					Illegal addition of bovine-and ovine/caprine-derived ingredients into ruminant feeds would increase the risk of spreading transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE). In this study, a nuclear DNA sequence with 18-bp deletion in ovine/caprine genomes was screened for specific detection of bovine-and ovine/caprine-derived ingredients in ruminant feeds. A universal primer distinguishable PCR (UP-D-PCR) method based on these sequence differences was then established, which is capable of simultaneously identifying and distinguishing bovine (125 bp) and ovine/caprine (107 bp) in one reaction, with a sensitivity of 0.1 ng DNA or 1% meat and bone meal (MBM). The specificity of UP-D-PCR was strictly tested with 20 animal species and 3 feed materials, and the stability and reliability were adequately evaluated in different individuals of 4 bovine species and 5 ovine/caprine breeds. The co-detection ability of UP-D-PCR method was further confirmed in binary meat mixture samples. Five commercial feed samples were accurately analyzed by the UP-D-PCR method, showing good applicability. The method developed in this study will provide an accurate, efficient, and low-cost technology to combat illegal addition in ruminant feeds and protect human and livestock health. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	6	1553	1561	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-03984-2					FSTA:2022-09-Sa4582

Effect of frying oil stability over repeated reuse cycles on the quality and safety of deep-fried Nile tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus): a response surface modeling approach.		International Journal of Food Properties					Fresh water fish is considered a source of good quality proteins and essential fats. Frying is among widely used fish preparation techniques globally. Deep-frying oil quality with repeated uses, has been a concern. This research investigated the influence of frying oil stability (expressed as levels of peroxide values (0.2, 1.2 meq/kg) and free fatty acids (0.05, 0.13% palmitic acid)) over repeated uses (1,6 cycles) on the oxidative stability and essential nutrients of fried fish using a response surface approach, with the objectives of generating information relevant for the improvement of community health outcomes, with a special focus of this particular research was on trends, but not optimization. The frying oil and fried fish quality were adequately explained by response surface model and supported by principal component analysis. The result showed that the oxidative stability of both the frying oil and fried fish were deteriorating over the reuse cycles of the frying oil (with increasing trends of unhealthy fats, saturated and trans) corresponding to decreasing trends in the healthy fat components and vitamin A. It was also indicated that the essential fats (omega 3, omega 6, cis, vitamin A), were decreased while the risky fats (saturated, trans) were increased along with the frying cycles. The result revealed the urgent need for regulating frying oil and fried food qualities, particularly in developing countries. © 2022 Aemiro Tadesse Zula and Tadesse Fikre Teferra.

Bioaccessibility, gut microbial metabolism and intestinal transport of phenolics from 100% Concord grape juice and whole grapes are similar in a simulated digestion and fecal fermentation model.		Food & Function					Phenolic rich 100% grape juice has been associated with many health benefits, but its place in dietary guidance is controversial relative to whole fruit. Direct comparisons of phenolic profiles and bioavailability between these food forms are needed. Phenolic bioaccessibility and metabolism from Concord (CG) and Niagara (NG) grapes and corresponding 100% juices were investigated using an in vitro digestion coupled with anaerobic gut fermentation model. Intestinal transport of resulting bioaccessible phenolics and microbial metabolites was estimated using a Caco-2 cell model. Total bioaccessible phenolics from both upper and lower digestion were similar (P > 0.05) between NG (400.9 26.3mumol per 100g) and NGJ (349.5 8.3mumol per 100g) and significantly different (P < 0.05) between CG (417.2 24.4mumol per 100g) and CGJ (294.3 45.4mumol per 100g) total cellular transport of phenolics was similar (P > 0.05) between whole grapes (89.4 5.3mumol per 100g for CG, and 71.8 2.4mumol per 100g for NG) and 100% juices (88.0 5.6mumol per 100g for CGJ, and 85.3 9.4mumol per 100g for NGJ). Differences were observed between the location of phenolic metabolism, bioaccessibility and subsequent cellular transport of individual phenolics between grapes and juice matrices. Specifically, greater amounts of phenolics were transported from grape juices than whole grapes from the upper tract. However, cumulative bioaccessibility and transport from upper and lower GI digestion/fermentation together indicates that the absorbable phenolics from 100% grape juice is similar to that of whole grapes, suggesting that phenolic-mediated health benefits from consumption of whole fruit and juice may be similar. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	8	4315	4330	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo04226b					FSTA:2022-08-Hq6940
J		Zuman Dou; Chun Chen; Qiang Huang; Xiong Fu							In vitro digestion of the whole blackberry fruit: bioaccessibility, bioactive variation of active ingredients and impacts on human gut microbiota.		Food Chemistry					In vitro digestion and fermentation of blackberry fruit was investigated, and results showed that the phenolics were mainly released in gastric phase while carbohydrates in small intestinal phase. The bioaccessibility for phenolics and carbohydrates were 42.80% and 69.30%, indicating most of phenolics still remain in colon and available for intestinal flora. The total phenolics released during the digestion account for the improvement of antioxidant and hypoglycemic activities. Especially, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside with higher released amount and bioaccessibility index (63.21%), exhibited the strongest alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity. After fermentation, the non-digestible fractions of blackberry affected the ecosystem of the intestinal tract by decreasing the colonic pH (DeltapH = 1.10), enhancing the production of SCFAs and modulating gut microbiota composition (the ratio of Firmicute/Bacteroidetes decreased from13.18 to 0.87). The results provided insights into the digestive properties and health benefits of blackberry fruit after consumption.

J		Zunaira Tahir; Farhan Saeed; Farhana Nosheen; Aftab Ahmed; Faqir M. Anjum							Comparative study of nutritional properties and antioxidant activity of raw and fermented (black) garlic.		International Journal of Food Properties					The core objective of this research work was to determine the nutritional and bioactive profile of raw and fermented (black) garlic. For this purpose, different varieties of garlic i.e., desi and farmi were procured from local market of Faisalabad, Pakistan. In addition, desi raw garlic (DRG) and farmi raw garlic (FRG) were converted into desi fermented (black) garlic (DFG) and farmi fermented garlic (FFG) through fermentation in incubator at 60°C and 70-80% humidity level for 30 days. Moreover, nutritional composition and antioxidant activity of raw and fermented (black) garlic were also elucidated. Results showed that moisture content of garlic was rapidly reduced, whereas crude protein, crude fiber, crude ash, and carbohydrate contents were significantly improved after fermentation. In addition, protein contents of DRG and FRG garlic were 8.57 0.21 and 6.38 0.05g/100g whilst 9.5 0.35 and 8.1 0.06g/100g, in DFG and FFG, respectively, after fermentation. Additionally, carbohydrate contents were also increased up to 30-40% after fermentation. Mineral contents such as potassium, sulfur, aluminum, iron, sodium, magnesium, zinc, and copper were also increased after fermentation. Furthermore, garlic fermentation significantly reduced pH level. Antioxidant activity showed that total phenolic contents (TPC) of DRG & FRG were 2421.3 & 2128.5mg GAE/kg while 2886.7, & 2529.8mg GAE/kg for DFG and FFG, respectively. Total flavonoid contents of DRG and FRG were 124 & 101mg RE/100g, whereas DFG and FFG were 191 & 121mgRE/100g. FRAP, DPPH, and ABTS values were higher in DRG and DFG as compared to FRG and FFG. Conclusively, fermented (black) garlic showed a higher nutritional profile, mineral content, as well as antioxidant activity as compared to raw garlic.

Food & Function					Nonalcoholic liver disease (NAFLD) is a pathological condition characterized by excessive fat deposition in the liver, and NAFLD usually has a close relationship with obesity or metabolic syndrome. Currently, oxidative stress is considered as an important risk factor in the progression of NAFLD, therefore, effective amelioration of oxidative stress has emerged as a promising way to improve NAFLD. Tangeretin is a natural compound having various pharmacological activities including antioxidation and hepatoprotection. However, whether tangeretin is able to improve NAFLD through reducing hepatic oxidative stress is rarely reported. In our work, the preventive effects of tangeretin on a NAFLD mouse model induced by a high fat (HF) diet were studied. The results exhibited that tangeretin supplementation observably slowed down NAFLD progression through alleviation of metabolic indexes such as glucose tolerance, serum lipid levels and inflammatory factors, hepatic oxidative stress as well as steatosis. QRT-PCR showed that tangeretin supplementation increased the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) expression and then upregulated the expression of its downstream factors including HO-1, GCLC, NQO1 and GSTA2. Furthermore, the expression of the hepatic nucleus, Nrf2, HO-1 and GCLC, was also seen to be significantly enhanced in WB analysis. Taken together, this study implies that tangeretin might alleviate NAFLD through lowering oxidative stress in the liver by partial modulation of the Nrf2 pathway. Our study provided theoretical support that tangeretin could be used as a dietary therapy for obesity related-NAFLD or related metabolic syndrome. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022.										2022	13	5	2782	2790	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02989d					FSTA:2022-06-Aj10368
J		Zuobing Xiao; Xueying Cao; Jiancai Zhu; Feng Chen; Yunwei Niu							Characterization of the key aroma compounds in three world-famous black teas.		European Food Research and Technology					The volatile compounds of three world-famous black teas (Darjeeling, DJL, Keemun, KM, and Ceylon, CL) were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction (SBSE), and analyzed by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The results indicated that 78, 76, and 69 volatile compounds were detected in the three tea infusions. And 9 sulfur compounds in black teas were identified by gas chromatography-flame photometric detection (GC-FPD). In addition, a total of 42 aroma compounds were perceived and 38 compounds were identified as important aroma compounds due to their high odor activity values (OAVs), such as 3-methylbutanal (OAV: 24-82), linalool (OAV: 24-64), geraniol (OAV: 2-97), beta-ionone (OAV: 54-122), and cis-jasmone (OAV: 2-119). According to the results of aroma recombination and omission experiments, 2-methylbutanal, linalool, methyl salicylate and beta-cyclocitral were confirmed to be the key aroma compounds in Darjeeling black tea, 3-methylbutanal, hexanal, beta-myrcene, and methyl salicylate were the key aroma compounds in Keemun, while beta-ionone, linalool, 2-methylbutanal, and salicylaldehyde were the key aroma compounds in Ceylon black tea. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	248	9	2237	2252	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-022-04039-2					FSTA:2022-11-Hn10550
J		Zuobing Xiao; Minxing Niu; Yunwei Niu; Jiancai Zhu							Evaluation of the perceptual interaction among sulfur compounds in durian by Feller's additive model and odor activity value.		Food Analytical Methods					Volatile aroma compounds in durian (Musang King) were comprehensively analyzed by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME), solvent-assisted flavor evaporation (SAFE), gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O), and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Twenty-seven odorant active compounds were identified by GC-O, and 56 volatile aroma compounds were identified by GC-MS. There were 21 compounds with odor activity value (OAV) greater than 1. Diethyl disulfide (OAV: 1,726, 977.8-4,180, 425.2), ethyl mercaptan (OAV: 16,973.2), propane mercaptan (OAV: 240,891.5), ethyl 2-methylbutanoate (OAV: 49,640.1-82,369.9), and 2-propyl methyl butyrate (OAV: 2310.4-2384.1) were considered to be important contributors to the aroma of durian samples. Ethyl propyl sulfide, dipropyl sulfide, methyl propyl trisulfide, and hexyl hexanoate were detected in durian for the first time. Feller's addition model and OAV were selected to study five sulfide interactions. Among the 10 binary mixtures, seven binary mixtures exhibited masking effect, two binary mixtures exhibited synergistic effect, and one binary mixture exhibited addition effect. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.										2022	15	7	1787	1802	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-022-02238-x					FSTA:2022-12-Jg16931
J		Zuobing Xiao; Xinyi Jiang; Yunwei Niu							Study on the interaction of sweet protein (thaumatin) with key aroma compounds in passion fruit juice using electronic nose, ultraviolet spectrum, thermodynamics, and molecular docking.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					As a high-intensity sweetener and flavor enhancer, thaumatin has received a lot of attention from the industry with the increasing demand for sugar reduction. Also as a protein, it can interact with volatiles to influence the overall consumer perception of the product. This work was the first to explore the interaction between sweet protein and aroma. Volatile substances were analyzed using SPME and SBSE. 24 volatiles were identified as key aroma compounds in passion fruit juice by AEDA in combination with OAV. The electronic nose result that there were differences in aroma between the juices after adding different concentrations of thaumatin. In addition, the adsorption capacity experiments showed that thaumatin had an adsorption effect on furfural, dihydro-beta-ionone, and geraniol, and release effect on ethyl hexanoate and limonene. Ultraviolet spectrum analysis showed that furfural, dihydro-beta-ionone, and geraniol can interact with thaumatin. The thermodynamic and molecular docking results further indicated that these interactions were mainly guided by hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds, and electrostatic interactions.

Food Chemistry					The effects of different liquid nitrogen freezing (LNF) temperatures (-35, -55, -75, -95, and -115°C) on the freezing rate, physicochemical properties, and microstructure of golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) were evaluated in the present study. The results showed that the total freezing time of golden pompano was significantly shortened using LNF (P< 0.05). Compared with other freezing methods, the cooking loss and L* values (lightness) of -95°C LNF golden pompano were significantly lower, the false-colour image was much redder and brighter, the loss and mobility of water in fish muscle were inhibited, the water holding capacity and hardness were higher, and the muscle microstructure was comparatively intact. Therefore, -95°C LNF effectively shortened the freezing time and improved the muscle qualities of frozen golden pompano.

Food Research International					Vegetable oils with different unsaturated degrees (corn > peanut > olive > palm > coconut) and corresponding enzymatic hydrolysis-thermal oxidation (ENTH) oils were added into D-xylose and L-cysteine Maillard reaction (MR) system, respectively, for potential meaty aroma production. Results indicated that coconut oil and palm oil had lower peroxide, p-anisidine, total antioxidant values, and malondialdehyde content after ENTH and MR. Corn, peanut, and olive oils after ENTH could significantly promote MR because they caused the lower pH, higher reactants depletion, and higher browning degree in the water phase separated from the oil-Maillard reaction system. Additionally, the volatiles were mainly formed from oil phase. Corn, peanut, and olive oils were beneficial to volatiles formation in the oil-MR system due to fatty acid oxidation, especially oleic acid and linoleic acid. Meanwhile, compared to raw oils, adding ENTH oils to the MR system could reduce the content of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-containing heterocycles.

J		Zurek, J.; Rudy, M.; Duma-Kocan, P.; StanisLawczyk, R.; Gil, M.							Impact of kosher slaughter methods of heifers and young bulls on physical and chemical properties of their meat.		Foods					This work aimed to comprehensively analyze the factors (slaughter method, gender, and muscle type) that determine the kosher status of beef and assess their influence on the selected quality characteristics of raw meat. The muscles were obtained from 40 carcasses of heifers and 40 carcasses of young bulls. In the first stage of the experiment, pH values were measured. The water, protein, fat, minerals, and collagen contents were determined. Then, the shear force, forced drip, and thermal drip were measured. The experimental results indicated that all the investigated parameters have an impact on the final quality of beef. Statistically significantly lower pH1 values were noticed in the longissimus thoracic muscle of young bulls obtained through kosher slaughter methods. However, 24 and 48 h after slaughter, higher pH values were observed in the meat of young bulls obtained by the kosher slaughter method, where the meat samples were subjected to kosher treatment. The koshering process (salting and washing) resulted in a significant reduction in both forced and thermal drip values of the meat sample, but this decrease was not affected by gender. © 2022 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work reports the evolution of polyphenolic compounds content during the cidermaking process in the Basque Country (Northern Spain). Fourteen monovarietal musts were obtained throughout three seasons (13 different, one repeated) using different apple cultivars from the Basque Country. Monovarietal musts were used to cover a wide range of polyphenolic content and to introduce variability. These musts were fermented and matured to obtain 14monovarietal ciders. The evolution of the musts was monitored during 6-8months by measuring the polyphenolic profile with an HPLC method throughout 4 or 5 samplings. Chlorogenic acid, 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid and (-)-epicatechin showed fluctuations during the alcoholic fermentation (10-40 days), followed by stabilisation. With phloretin 2′-O-xyloglucoside, an increase or a stable concentration was observed during the alcoholic fermentation followed by stabilisation. Tyrosol, absent in the initial musts, showed an increase during the alcoholic fermentation and became stable afterwards. These were the only general patterns observed. The rest of the phenolic compounds studied, such as procyanidin B1, procyanidin B2 and phloridzin, did not show any general evolution rule.

Food Chemistry					Training systems are an option to handle the pronounced apical dominance of grapevines and to influence diverse traits of the corresponding wine. However, it is still unclear if different training systems generate signatures in the metabolome of the wine. By an untargeted metabolomics approach using (SPME) GC-MS wine (volatiles) and leaves were evaluated. Different training directions such as vertical shoot positioning systems, hanging shoot systems, and minimal pruning systems were distinguishable in wine. It was shown, that different training systems generate a metabolomic signature in the wine which was more pronounced than in leaves. Moreover, the sensory analysis showed some changes in the aroma of the different training systems. Thus, the influence of the training system ranges from the leaf metabolome to the wine metabolome.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to inactivate Shigella flexneri using curcumin-based photosensitization and determine the sensitivity of S. flexneri to the combination of epsilon (epsilon)-polylysine (epsilon-PL) and curcumin-based photosensitization for decontamination. Bacterial numbers were reduced by 4.65 log CFU/mL after incubation with 80 muM curcumin and illumination for 20 min. Photosensitization resulted in cell morphology changes and increased cell permeability and protein degradation. Oxidative stress gene (oxyR) and efflux pump genes (marA, acrA) were upregulated. Decontamination of S. flexneri after incubation with curcumin and epsilon-PL for 1 h followed by photoactivation for 60 s has been investigated. It was found that the growth of bacteria was completely inhibited. Additionally, the number of bacteria was reduced by > 6 log CFU/mL. Experiments on the uptake of curcumin molecules by bacteria showed that epsilon-PL promoted the penetration of bacterial cells by curcumin, thus enhancing the effects of photosensitization.

J		Zuxuan Qi; Xiaohong Wu; Yangjian Yang; Bin Wu; Haijun Fu							Discrimination of the red jujube varieties using a portable NIR spectrometer and fuzzy improved linear discriminant analysis.		Foods					In order to quickly, nondestructively, and effectively distinguish red jujube varieties, based on the combination of fuzzy theory and improved LDA (iLDA), fuzzy improved linear discriminant analysis (FiLDA) algorithm was proposed to classify near-infrared reflectance (NIR) spectra of red jujube samples. FiLDA shows performs better than iLDA in dealing with NIR spectra containing noise. Firstly, the portable NIR spectrometer was employed to gather the NIR spectra of five kinds of red jujube, and the initial NIR spectra were pretreated by standard normal variate transformation (SNV), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), Savitzky-Golay smoothing (S-G smoothing), mean centering (MC) and Savitzky-Golay filter (S-G filter). Secondly, the high-dimensional spectra were processed for dimension reduction by principal component analysis (PCA). Then, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), iLDA and FiLDA were applied to extract features from the NIR spectra, respectively. Finally, K nearest neighbor (KNN) served as a classifier for the classification of red jujube samples. The highest classification accuracy of this identification system for red jujube, by using FiLDA and KNN, was 94.4%. These results indicated that FiLDA combined with NIR spectroscopy was an available method for identifying the red jujube varieties and this method has wide application prospects. © 2022 by the authors.

J		Zuzhe Wang; Jingran Bi; Haitao Wang; Mingqian Tan							Assessment of potential toxicity of onion-like carbon nanoparticles from grilled turbot Scophthalmus maximus L.		Foods					Although the presence of foodborne nanoparticles was confirmed in grilled fish in a previous study, the evaluation of potential health risks of these NPs was insufficient. In the present study, the potential toxicity of onion-like carbon nanoparticles (OCNPs) separated from grilled turbot Scophthalmus maximus L. Was evaluated using mouse osteoblasts cells model and zebrafish (Danio rerio) model. Cytotoxicity evaluation revealed that the OCNPs penetrated into the MC3T3-E1 cells without arousing cell morphology changes. No evident apoptosis or damage of cells was observed with increasing OCNPs' concentration to 20mg/mL. In the hemolysis test, OCNPs did not show an obvious hemolysis effect on red blood cells. In the acute toxicity test, the LC50 value (212.431mg/L) of OCNPs to zebrafish showed a weak acute toxicity. In subacute toxicity test, after exposure to OCNPs (30mg/L, 40mg/L) for 10 days, a significant increase of reactive oxygen species level of zebrafish was observed. Meanwhile, redundant ROS content caused inhibition to several antioxidant enzymes and induced lipid and protein peroxidation damages according to the upregulation of malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl levels. The chronic toxicity test results indicated that oxidative stress was only observed in the high concentration group of OCNPs-treated zebrafish. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Zuzheng Wang; Zhixiang Wu; Minke Zou; Xin Wen; Zheng Wang; Yuanzhang Li; Qingchuan Zhang							A voting-based ensemble deep learning method focused on multi-step prediction of food safety risk levels: applications in hazard analysis of heavy metals in grain processing products.		Foods					Grain processing products constitute an essential component of the human diet and are among the main sources of heavy metal intake. Therefore, a systematic assessment of risk factors and early-warning systems are vital to control heavy metal hazards in grain processing products. In this study, we established a risk assessment model to systematically analyze heavy metal hazards and combined the model with the K-means++ algorithm to perform risk level classification. We then employed deep learning models to conduct a multi-step prediction of risk levels, providing an early warning of food safety risks. By introducing a voting-ensemble technique, the accuracy of the prediction model was improved. The results indicated that the proposed model was superior to other models, exhibiting the overall accuracy of 90.47% in the 7-day prediction and thus satisfying the basic requirement of the food supervision department. This study provides a novel early-warning model for the systematic assessment of the risk level and further allows the development of targeted regulatory strategies to improve supervision efficiency. © 2022 by the authors.

Characteristics of water and ethanolic extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis root and their effect on color, lipid oxidation, and microbiological quality of chicken meatballs during refrigerated storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In research, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activitivies of water and ethanolic extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis root on quality of chicken meatballs during refrigerated storage were determined. Extracts were analyzed for identification and quantification of polyphenols, DPPH, and antimicrobial activity. Three different treatments of meatballs were prepared: control (MB), with addition of water extract (MBWE), and with addition of ethanolic extract (MBEE). The water extract was characterized by lower phenolic content (235.86 mg/gdm) and lower DPPH (257.56 mumol Trolox/gdm) than ethanolic extract. The ethanolic extract was also characterized by higher antimicrobial activity in relation to selected strains of microorganisms. Oxidative changes in MBEE were significantly (p<.05) lower in comparison with MB. This was indicated by lower (by 50%) TBARS values and almost twice as long fat induction time. A higher content of polyphenol compounds in the ethanolic extract (especially baicalein) resulted in a more effective reduction of lipid oxidation. Novelty impact statement. Antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts are well documented. However, the use of S. baicalensis as a source of natural antioxidants directly in meat products has not been widely studied so far. Our studies showed that use of ethanolic extract significantly slowed down oxidative changes occurring in chicken meatballs during storage, reducing the increase in TBARS index by 50% and doubling the fat induction time. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effects of reducing dietary cation-anion difference on lactation performance and nutrient digestibility of lactating cows and ammonia emissions from manure.		Journal of Dairy Science					Reducing the dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) reduces urine pH and, therefore, has potential to lower NH3 emissions from manure. We determined the effects of decreased DCAD on dry matter intake, production, nutrient digestibility, manure characteristics, and NH3 emissions from manure. An in vitro incubation study was conducted to evaluate the degree of reduced urine pH on manure pH and NH3 emissions from manure. In this study, urine pH was directly decreased from 8.5 to 7.5, 6.5, and 5.5 by adding sulfuric acid, which resulted in decreases in manure pH when manure was reconstituted with the fecal-to-urine ratio of 2:1 (as-is basis). The manures from urine at pH 7.5,6.5, and 5.5 decreased NH3 emissions linearly by 19,33, and 36%, respectively, compared with the manure from unacidified urine. An animal study was conducted with 27 mid-lactation Holstein cows in a randomized complete block design. Cows were blocked by parity and days in milk and assigned to 1 of 3 different DCAD diets: (1) HDCAD, a diet with DCAD of 193 mEq/kg of dry matter (DM); (2) MDCAD, a diet with 101mEq/kg of DM; and (3) LDCAD, a diet with 1mEq/kg of DM. A commercial anionic product (predominantly ammonium chloride) partly replaced urea, soybean meal, soyhulls, and corn grain in MDCAD and LDCAD to lower DCAD. The experiment lasted 7 wk (1-wk covariate followed by 6-wk data collection). Spot urine and fecal samples were collected for manure incubation. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS in a randomized block design. Dry matter intake and milk yield were not altered by treatments. No difference in milk fat content was observed among treatments, but fat yield tended to decrease linearly (1.00 to 0.86kg/d) as DCAD decreased, resulting in a tendency for decreasing energy-corrected milk yield (35.1 to 32.7kg/d). Milk protein content increased (3.00 to 3.14%) as DCAD decreased, but milk protein yield was not affected. Total-tract digestibility of DM, organic matter, and neutral detergent fiber did not differ among treatments. Digestibility of crude protein tended to decrease as DCAD decreased. There was no difference in fecal and urine N excretion among treatments, but fecal N as proportion of N intake tended to increase as DCAD decreased. Urine pH decreased linearly from 8.42 for HDCAD to 8.11 and 6.41 for MDCAD and LDCAD, respectively, resulting in decreased manure pH (7.57, 7.40, and 6.96 for HDCAD, MDCAD, and LDCAD, respectively). The cumulative NH3 emissions from manures over 6 d tended to decrease linearly as DCAD decreased (461 to 390mg/kg of manure), but the decrease was only numerical when calculated on a cow basis (i.e., g/cow). In conclusion, lowering DCAD has potential to reduce NH3 emission from manure of lactating cows. However, a tendency for decreased milk fat yield and energy-corrected milk yield suggests that DCAD of 1mEq/kg of DM may be too low, and more studies are needed to examine relatively less reduced DCAD to determine production responses in addition to NH3 emission from manure.

Effects of corn distillers grains with yeast bodies and manipulation of dietary cation and anion difference on production, nutrient digestibility, and gas emissions from manure in lactating cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					In a randomized complete block design, 40 lactating Holstein cows (average 98 d in milk and 41kg/d of milk yield) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 diets: (1) containing soybean meal as the major protein supplement (CON diet); (2) CON diet with high-protein dried corn distillers grains at 20% on a dry matter (DM) basis by replacing mainly soybean meal (DG diet); (3) DG diet except that high-protein dried corn distillers grains with yeast bodies (extracted after corn ethanol production) was used (DGY diet); or (4) DG diet supplemented with sodium bicarbonate and potassium carbonate to elevate the dietary cation and anion difference (DCAD; DG-DCAD diet). The DCAD of CON, DG, DGY, and DG-DCAD were 185, 62, 67, and 187mEq/kg of DM, respectively. The experiment began with a 10-d covariate period and then cows were fed the experimental diets for 5 wk (2-wk diet adaptation and 3-wk data collection periods). Dry matter intake and milk yield were measured daily, and spot urine and fecal samples were collected in the last week of the experiment to measure nutrient digestibility; N, S, and P utilization and excretion; and in vitro NH3 and H2S emissions from manure. All data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS (random effect: block; fixed effects: diets, repeated week, and interactions). During data collection, DM intake was not different among treatment groups, but milk yield tended to be lower (42.4 vs. 39.9kg/d) for DG, DGY, and DG-DCAD versus CON, which could have been caused by decreases in organic matter and neutral detergent fiber digestibility. Milk protein yield tended to be lower (1.33 vs. 1.24kg/d) for DG, DGY, and DG-DCAD versus CON. Milk fat yield was lower (1.26 vs. 1.55kg/d) for DG and DGY versus CON, but that for DG-DCAD (1.43kg/d) did not differ from CON. Similarly, energy-corrected milk was lower (38.0 vs. 43.3kg/d) for cows on DG and DGY versus those on CON, but it did not differ between DG-DCAD (40.7kg/d) and CON. Urinary and fecal N excretion were greater for DG, DGY, and DG-DCAD compared with CON due to greater dietary crude protein content and N intake. However, NH3 emissions did not differ across treatments. Intakes of dietary P and S were greater for DG, DGY, and DG-DCAD, resulting in greater excretion of those in manure and greater H2S emissions from manure compared with CON. These data suggest that the negative effects of feeding distillers grains on production of lactating cows can be partly explained by a decrease in nutrient digestibility (milk yield) and excessive anion load (milk fat). The milk fat response to DG-DCAD suggests that milk fat depression observed with a diet with high content of distillers grains can be partially alleviated by supplementation of cations. In the current study, we observed no beneficial effects of DG containing yeast bodies. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Science and Biotechnology					The risk of foodborne illnesses caused by pathogens could be increased in fresh-cut fruit products owing to contamination during processing. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the microbiological quality and safety of commercial fresh-cut fruit products in Korea. Additionally, the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in selected fresh-cut fruits was evaluated, and their growth curves were analyzed using predictive growth modeling. The mean count of total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and yeast/mold was 3.67 1.73 log10 CFU/g, 1.54 1.01 log10 CFU/g, and 3.81 1.51 log10 CFU/g, respectively. Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli O157:H7, L. monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Cyclospora spp. were not detected in any of the tested samples. Only Bacillus cereus was detected in a few samples at the mean level of 1.72 0.13 log10 CFU/g. The growth of L. monocytogenes varied depending on the type of fruit; they grew well in non-acidic fresh-cut fruit products during storage at 10 °C. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	10	1393	1401	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00974-0					FSTA:2022-02-Jb1661

Foods					Adulteration of meat products is a delicate issue for people around the globe. The mixing of lard in meat causes a significant problem for end users who are sensitive to halal meat consumption. Due to the highly similar lipid profiles of meat species, the identification of adulteration becomes more difficult. Therefore, a comprehensive spectral detailing of meat species is required, which can boost the adulteration detection process. The experiment was conducted by distributing samples labeled as "Pure (80 samples)" and "Adulterated (90 samples)". Lard was mixed with the ratio of 10-50% v/v with beef, lamb, and chicken samples to obtain adulterated samples. Functional groups were discovered for pure pork, and two regions of difference (RoD) at wave numbers 1700-1800 cm-1 and 2800-3000 cm-1 were identified using absorbance values from the FTIR spectrum for all samples. The principal component analysis (PCA) described the studied adulteration using three principal components with an explained variance of 97.31%. The multi-class support vector machine (M-SVM) was trained to identify the sample class values as pure and adulterated clusters. The acquired overall classification accuracy for a cluster of pure samples was 81.25%, whereas when the adulteration ratio was above 10%, 71.21% overall accuracy was achieved for a group of adulterated samples. Beef and lamb samples for both adulterated and pure classes had the highest classification accuracy value of 85%, whereas chicken had the lowest value of 78% for each category. This paper introduces a comprehensive spectrum analysis for pure and adulterated samples of beef, chicken, lamb, and lard. Moreover, we present a rapid M-SVM model for an accurate classification of lard adulteration in different samples despite its low-level presence. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Hydrocolloids					Three-dimensional food printing (3DFP) leads to advances in digital gastronomy by targeting consumers' specific requirements for nutrition customization and visual appeal. Dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, is prevalent in elderly people and patients suffering from debilitating illnesses. Dysphagic diets require textural modifications to render them soft and safe to swallow. Diets must be visually pleasing to enable a greater food uptake to prevent malnutrition in patients. 3DFP so far has mainly utilized freeze-dried vegetable powders for shaping 3D designs. Our work focuses on fresh and frozen vegetables having better nutritional profile and low costs. Three different categories of vegetables are identified based on the number of hydrocolloids required to render them printable. Garden pea, carrot and bok choy are chosen as representatives in each category, which requires no HC, one type of HC and two types of HCs, respectively. Food inks are prepared by the addition of HCs i.e. xanthan gum (XG), kappa carrageenan (KC) and locust bean gum (LBG) for texture modification. Rheological, textural, microstructural and syneresis properties of the inks are examined. International dysphagia diet standardisation initiative (IDDSI) tests are done to assess the potential of the inks for dysphagic diets. Optimized ink formulations display excellent 3D printability, minimal water seepage, and dense microstructures with minimal amount of HCs. Using fresh vegetables instead of freeze-dried foods serves the purpose of preserving flavour and nutrition like real food. This in turn may bring 3DFP closer to the hospital and nursing home kitchens. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	114				0268-005X				10.1016/j.foodhyd.2020.106546					FSTA:2021-05-Jq6371
J		Aalaei, K.; Khakimov, B.; Gobba, C. de; Ahrne, L.							Gastric digestion of milk proteins in adult and elderly: effect of high-pressure processing.		Foods					Reduced physiological capability of the human gastrointestinal tract with increasing age has recently attracted considerable attention to the potential of novel technologies to modify food digestion. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate gastric digestion of milk proteins after application of high-pressure processing (HPP) at 400 MPa 15 min, 600 MPa 5 min and 600 MPa 15 min using two static in vitro models of adults (INFOGEST) and the elderly in comparison to a fresh untreated raw milk. Peptides distribution classified based on the number of amino acids (AA) (<10, 11-15, 16-20, 21-30, >30 AA) were investigated after 0, 5, 10 and 30 min of digestion using LC-MS and multivariate data analysis. Our results show significantly less efficient protein digestion of all investigated milks in the elderly model indicated by higher percentages of longer peptides during digestion, except for the HPP milk 400 MPa 15 min, which indicated an improved and comparable digestion in the elderly as in the adult model. Furthermore, increasing the pressurization time at 600 MPa did not have a significant effect on the peptides profile during the digestion. More efficient digestion of whey proteins in HPP milks, with the majority of peptides in the 16-20 AA range, compared to fresh milk was also noticed. According to the findings of this study, HPP at 400 MPa 15 min showed the most efficient digestion of major milk proteins and thus may be considered a suitable process to improve bioaccessibility of milk proteins, especially in products intended for the elderly. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Aanisha Akhtar; Mandeep Singh; Senthilmurugan Subbiah; Kaustubha Mohanty							Sugarcane juice concentration using a novel aquaporin hollow fiber forward osmosis membrane.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					In this work, the performance of a commercially available aquaporin HFFO membrane was studied for concentrating the sugarcane juice by adopting appropriate UF pretreatment technique. The influences of draw and feed solution flowrates, draw concentration and its direction of flow such as co-current or counter-current on water and reverse solute flux was evaluated in batch mode. The specific reverse solute flux for counter-current mode was found to be less compared to co-current mode of operation. Improved draw solution (NaCl) flowrate increased the water flux with reduced specific reverse solute flux. The FS concentration ratio was 1.65 within 12 min of batch FO operation by using 100 g L-1 draw solution. Membrane fouling was studied systematically with appropriate membrane cleaning strategy. The effect of UF clarified and raw sugarcane juice on FO membrane fouling was calculated and it was found that raw sugarcane juice led to severe membrane fouling that reduced water permeability after 60 min of operation. The membrane fouled by UF clarified juice was able to regenerate by DI water wash for 30 min, however in the case of membrane fouled by raw juice, an additional 0.1 M NaOH wash was required.

J		Aanisha Akhtar; Mandeep Singh; Senthilmurugan Subbiah; Kaustubha Mohanty							Modelling, experimental validation and process design of forward osmosis process for sugarcane juice concentration.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The viability of the FO process for concentration of sugarcane juice by using a commercially available aquaporin embedded hollow fibre membrane module (HFFO) (active area, 2.3 m2) is presented. NaCl is used as a draw solution (DS), and the selection of suitable DS concentration, flow conditions and flow configuration are observed to be vital aspects to minimize the reverse solute flux (RSF) and energy consumption. Further, the one dimensional mathematical model for the batch and continuous FO process using HF module is developed and validated with experimental data within the error limit of 5% for water flux and RSF. Based on the flowsheet modelling, the method for establishing the optimized FO process is presented. The optimized FO flowsheet presented in this study can concentrate the sugarcane juice from 150 g L-1 to 531 g L-1 with energy consumption of 92.14 WL-1 of permeate and specific RSF=1.57 g L-1. Further, to commercialize FO process for sugarcane juice concentration application, the selection of suitable food-grade draw solute that can provide high osmotic pressure and low RSF is a very important aspect.

Melepat; Latha Chattothayil; Sunanda Chullipparambil							Variations in the levels of acute-phase proteins and lactoferrin in serum and milk during bovine subclinical mastitis.		Journal of Dairy Research					Variations in the levels of acute phase proteins and lactoferrin in serum and milk for diagnosis of subclinical mastitis in dairy cows are described in this research paper. Milking animals from two organized dairy farms in Kerala, India, were screened by California Mastitis Test (CMT), Electrical Conductivity test (EC) and Somatic Cell Count (SCC) test to identify animals affected with sub clinical mastitis (SCM). The concentrations of acute phase proteins (APP) Haptoglobin (Hp), C- reactive protein (CRP), Albumin, Lactoferrin (Lf) and alpha- 1 acid glycoprotein (AGP) in milk and Hp, Albumin, Serum Amyloid A (SAA) and CRP in the serum of 40 normal cows and 40 cows affected with sub clinical mastitis were assessed. Solid phase ELISA was employed for assessment of all parameters except the albumin levels, for which spectrophotometry was used. The values of Hp in milk; and SAA, AGP and Lf in serum, were significantly elevated in the group with sub clinical mastitis. Such variations were found to be independent of the specific bacterial organism causing the disease. These results show that significant variations exist in the levels of acute phase proteins Hp, AGP and Lf in milk, and SAA in serum of animals affected with subclinical bovine mastitis that are not affected by specific bacterial etiology.

Biodegradable films based on chitosan and defatted Chlorella biomass: functional and physical characterization.		Food Chemistry					Biodegradable films based on chitosan, glycerol, and defatted Chlorella biomass (DCB) were prepared and characterized in terms of thermal stability, mechanical, water barrier, and optical properties. Increasing DCB content from 5 to 25 wt% increased tensile strength of chitosan films by 235%. The incorporation of DCB decreased both moisture content and swelling degree of chitosan/defatted Chlorella biomass (Cs/DCB) films. Furthermore, increasing the content of defatted algal biomass decreased light transmission and reduced water vapor permeability of composite films by more than 60%. As confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared analysis, such improvement in functional and physical properties is mainly due to the homogeneous and uniform distribution of DCB into the polymeric matrix along with the establishment of strong hydrogen bond interactions between chitosan and algal biomass constituents. Moreover, Cs/DCB composite films showed more than 50% of degradation in 60 days soil burial test.

J		Aaslyng, M. D.; Hojer, R.							Introducing tempeh as a new plant-based protein food item on the Danish market.		Foods					Decreasing meat consumption has resulted in a need for new high-quality protein sources. Tempeh is relatively unknown in Denmark and might be capable of meeting this need. The aim of the study was to describe the success criteria for introducing locally produced tempeh and to investigate the sensory quality of three types of tempeh. Only 24% of the consumers in the survey (n = 395) used meat alternatives, which might be explained by a low level of satisfaction with availability. Tempeh was known by 26%-the less meat eaten, the greater the knowledge of tempeh. Twenty-three per cent of the consumers had positive attitudes towards tempeh. The three types of tempeh had markedly different sensory profiles. Nevertheless, the home use test showed that they could be used interchangeably in different recipes. In addition, the consumers were more positive about recipes in which tempeh did not resemble meat compared with meat-inspired recipes. In conclusion, introducing locally produced tempeh on the Danish market is possible but would require further knowledge of the product. In addition, tempeh should be sold as a tasty, high-quality protein food item in its own right. Recipes using tempeh should reflect this and not mimic meat recipes. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Cannabis sativa L. is a valuable plant that has regained its importance for medicinal use. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based untargeted metabolomic study was conducted in seeds of two accessions from different environments. A total of 236 metabolites were observed, and 43 metabolites were found differentially significant (p ≤ 0.05) in both the accessions. Based on the qualitative and quantitative accumulation of the nutraceutically important amino acids, cannabinoids, alkaloids, and fatty acids, the high altitude temperate Himalayan accession (CAN2) was found to have an advantage over the low altitude subtropical accession (CAN1). Seed oil from CAN2 showed the exclusive presence of linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid. The reducing power and DNA nicking assay on the methanolic extracts suggested higher antioxidant and nutraceutical potential in CAN2 and corroborated with the metabolic content of phenols and flavonoids. The environmental effect on the antioxidant and nutraceutical value in seeds is further discussed.

Microbial shelf life of coconut water subjected to various inoculation levels of Listeria monocytogenes and storage conditions.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The study determined the growth kinetic parameters of a cocktail of Listeria monocytogenes 1/2c and 4b strains in coconut water (pH 4.76, 5.0°Brix, 0.09% malic acid, aw 0.998) subjected to low (~2.0 log CFU/mL) and high (~4.0 log CFU/mL) contamination levels, and exposed to different storage temperatures (4 °C, 17 °C, 30 °C, and 35 °C). The pathogen proliferated in all tested conditions except in that with low contamination stored at 4 °C. Despite not growing at 4 °C, the pathogen was detectable throughout the storage period, which lasted for almost 400 h. In conditions where the pathogens proliferated, growth lag (tlag) ranged from 0.0 to 68.3 h. The growth rates (KG) ranged from 0.05 to 0.48 log CFU/h, while the final populations ranged from 6.3 to 8.7 log CFU/mL. Both storage temperature and contamination level significantly (P< 0.05) affected the growth parameters. Sanitary risk times (SRT) were determined with the microbiological shelf life (SL) of coconut water. In some of the conditions tested, SRT took place before SL (SRT < SL), emphasizing the importance of having good hygienic and manufacturing practices in place for such a vulnerable commodity.

J		Abad, A.; Shahidi, F.							Fatty acid, triacylglycerol and minor component profiles affect oxidative stability of camelina and sophia seed oils.		Food Bioscience					The fatty acid composition, triacylglycerol (TAG) profile, tocopherols, and oxidative stability of camelina and sophia seed oils, in the dark and under light, were evaluated. The significance of minor components to the stability of the oils was also examined upon their removal from the oil. A recently developed novel stripping method was employed for this purpose. Storage in the dark and under light dictated the stability of both stripped and non-stripped oils. Tested oil samples contained a high level of alpha-linolenic acid, 36.14-46.23 g/100 g oil. Five major TAG, namely LnLLn, LnLnLn, LnOLn, LLLn, and C20:2LL, were present in both oils. Total tocopherol contents were 1150.93-1262.54 ppm and comprised of alpha-, beta-/gamma-, and delta-tocopherols in sophia and camelina oils. Oxidative stability of the seed oils was affected by their fatty acid composition, triacylglycerols profiles, storage conditions, and minor components.

Production of ace inhibitory peptides from whey proteins modified by high intensity ultrasound using bromelain.		Foods					High Intensity Ultrasound (HIUS) can induce modification of the protein structure. The combination of enzymatic hydrolysis and ultrasound is an interesting strategy to improve the release of the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitory peptides. In this study, whey proteins were pretreated with HIUS at two levels of amplitude (30 and 50%) for 10 min, followed by hydrolysis using the vegetable protease bromelain. The hydrolysates obtained were ultrafiltrated and their fractions were submitted to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The conformational changes induced by HIUS on whey proteins were analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy by attenuated total reflectance (FTIR-ATR) and intrinsic spectroscopy. It was found that both levels of ultrasound pretreatment significantly decreased the IC50 value (50% Inhibitory Concentration) of the hydrolysates in comparison with the control (alpha = 0.05). After this treatment, HIUS-treated fractions were shown as smaller in size and fractions between 1 and 3 kDa displayed the highest ACE inhibition activity. HIUS promoted significant changes in whey protein structure, inducing, unfolding, and aggregation, decreasing the content of alpha-helix, and increasing beta-sheets structures. These findings prove that ultrasound treatment before enzymatic hydrolysis is an innovative and useful strategy that modifies the peptide profile of whey protein hydrolysates and enhances the production of ACE inhibitory peptides. © 2021 by the authors.

Application of an innovative water-assisted ultraviolet C light technology for the inactivation of microorganisms in tomato processing industries.		Food Microbiology					We aimed to study the efficacy of a water-assisted UVC light device (WUVC) as an innovative clean technology for the disinfection of fresh sound tomatoes and processing wash water and water turbidity was evaluated as a critical parameter. First, wash waters with different turbidities (from 0.4 to 828 NTU) were inoculated with Listeria innocua and treated in the WUVC device at different dosages. Secondly, fresh tomatoes, inoculated with L. innocua and non-inoculated ones, were treated using the WUVC device containing wash water of different turbidities for different times. The reduction of L. innocua populations on wash water and on the surface of tomato was influenced by turbidity; lower reduction values were observed at higher turbidities. Washing tomatoes with tap water with UVC lamps off (control treatment, TW) decreased L. innocua population on the surface of tomatoes but did not eliminate those bacteria that went into the water. Contrarily, when UVC lights were on, L. innocua population in wash water after treatment significantly decreased, those in clean water being the lowest populations. Reductions of native microbiota on the clean water treated with the highest UV-C radiation dose were lower than those obtained when tomatoes were artificially inoculated. We demonstrated that high reductions of L. innocua population on fresh tomatoes could be achieved using the WUVC system but some drawbacks related to the increase of turbidity should be solved for its implementation in real conditions.

Introducing quality certification in staple food markets in Sub-Saharan Africa: four conditions for successful implementation.		Food Policy					Third party quality certification can be used to reduce transaction frictions caused by asymmetric information in value chains. Such certification may help to secure the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in domestic markets for staple crops in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in the face of rising competition with high quality imports. Yet, while frequent in high value export crops, quality certification is still rare for staple crops. To understand why this discrepancy persists, we develop a model with four sufficient conditions for the functionality of certification in a value chain-willingness to pay for quality by downstream agents, upstream competition among traders with pass-through of quality-price premiums to farmers, existence of cost-effective certification, and farmers' capacity to respond to certification by enhancing quality. We show that if these conditions hold, certification should theoretically lead to farmers receiving higher prices for higher quality goods, increasing investment in quality-enhancing inputs, and experiencing welfare gains in response to this quality enhancement. To see if these conditions and results hold in practice, we turn to evidence from a country-level diagnostic survey and from results obtained by others. We find that while certification systems exist in most countries surveyed, evidence of downstream willingness to pay for quality and of price premiums paid to farmers for quality is uneven. However, in cases where quality price premiums do exist, we find evidence that producers respond by enhancing quality. We conclude that policymakers can promote quality certification in staple chains by first ensuring that the four conditions we identify hold. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Cocoa beans and derived products: effect of processing on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons levels.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Contamination of cocoa and its derived products by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) may occur due to high roasting temperatures and/or the presence of smoke during drying. Some PAHs are considered carcinogenic and genotoxic. Thirteen PAHs were investigated during cocoa processing. Two cocoa beans samples were used, with and without presence of smoke during drying. In both, an initial contamination was detected, 1.78 mug/kg for non-smoked beans and 66 mug/kg for smoked cocoa beans. After roasting, a decrease in contamination was observed. Levels detected in derived products were from not detected (shell) to 2.08 mug/kg (cocoa butter) for non-smoked beans and 5.2 mug/kg (cocoa powder) to 136 mug/kg (shell) for smoked beans. Mass balance showed that, for non-smoked cocoa beans, PAHs were transferred after pressing in equal proportions to cocoa butter (34%) and powder (37%). Smoked samples presented a large portion of PAHs in the shells (31%) and, after pressing, compounds remained mainly in the cocoa butter (43%). A tendency for PAHs to migrate to cocoa butter was observed. Drying cocoa beans without contact with smoke could reduce contamination and, therefore, human exposition to potentially carcinogenic and genotoxic compounds. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Determination of antimicrobial, pH, bile salt, and gastric juice tolerance properties of Lactobacilli isolated from human milk.		International Food Research Journal					Human milk is a complex biological fluid, and a source of nutrients and probiotics which plays a vital role in the growth and development of infants. Probiotics are helpful bacteria which are good for human health. The primary bacterial genera which are gaining status as probiotics are Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, and Bifidobacterium. The present work aimed to isolate, identify, and determine the probiotic potential of Lactobacillus bacteria from human milk. A total of 70 samples of human milk were collected from different lactating mothers. The milk samples were inoculated on the De Man, Rogosa, and Sharpe (MRS) agar plates to observe the growth of Lactobacillus bacteria. The bacteria were identified based on their morphology, culture characteristics, and biochemical properties. Isolated bacteria were evaluated for probiotic properties in which, tolerance to acidic pH, bile salts, and gastric juice as well as antibacterial activity and antibiotic susceptibility were determined. Out of the 70 milk samples, 57 were positive for Lactobacillus. Out of the positive sample, 10.5% of the samples tolerated acidic pH and high bile salt concentration, but a significant difference was obtained for gastric juice. In the antibacterial activity, Pseudomonas showed no action against Lactobacillus. In antibiotic susceptibility, the test isolates were resistant to penicillin. The present work proved the presence of beneficial bacteria in the human milk. Isolated Lactobacillus exhibited significant antibacterial activity against pathogenic bacteria, and tolerance to acidic pH, bile salt, and gastric juice. Therefore, human milk could be a good source of probiotics for infants.		ASLAM, BILAL/AAX-6227-2020	ASLAM, BILAL/0000-0002-5568-5049							2021	28	2	302	308	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-10-Pa5300
J		Abbas Abedfar; Marzieh Hosseininezhad; Alireza Sadeghi; Mojtaba Raeisi							Comparative survival of exopolysaccharide encapsulated Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus in simulated gastrointenstinal conditions and storage time.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of microbial exopolysaccharide (EPS) encapsulation of lactic acid bacteria on enhancing their viability during exposure to the simulated conditions of the gasterointestinal tract. Lactobacillus plantarum (NR_104573.1) and Pediococcus pentosaceus (NR_042058.1) isolated from wheat bran sourdough were encapsulated by spray-drying with various ratios of EPS, whey protein concentrate, carboxymethyl cellulose and pectin. The viability, kinetics and survival under stress conditions were compared between the samples after 120 min of incubation and over 28 days of storage. HPLC was used for compositional assessment in terms of monosaccharide constituents, revealing that glucose, arabinose and xylose were the major components of the EPS produced by L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus. ANOVA demonstrated a significantly reduced logarithmic cycle of bacterial population in the control samples and free cells compared to the encapsulated L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus after 2 h in simulated gastric fluid conditions and bile salt solution. Encapsulation yields in the presence of WPC, CMC and pectin with and without EPS were about 85 and 80% for L. plantarum, and it was 81 and 75% for P. pentosaceus, respectively. Also, the viability number of L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus free cells decreased over 28 days of storage from 12.41 to 7.28 and 12.11 to 6.96 log Cfu/mL, respectively. Finally, by assessing the kinetics of the bacteria with three mathematical models, the Ritger-Peppas kinetics model was found to be a suitable correlation model for the data. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	594	603	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00664-1					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3172

Physiological traits, yield, and yield components relationship in winter and spring canola.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Understanding the relationship between physiological traits with yield and yield components is an essential step towards developing high-yielding and high-quality canola (Brassica napus L.) cultivars. This study aimed to explore further the relationship between some physiological features, including radiation use efficiency (RUE), and seed yield in canola. Results. Significant differences were found among cultivars regarding maximum leaf area index (LAImax) and required days to achieve maximum LAI (DLAImax). All cultivars obtained the minimum LAI required to intercept 90% of the incident radiation, but at different times. Some cultivars like SW102 and Shirali had the same fraction of intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR) when LAI was maximal, but SW102 had higher IPAR. This indicated that SW102 was more efficient in irradiation capacity and may have a higher photosynthesis rate when exposed to the high irradiation conditions. The average canola RUE in the current study was 3.80 and 3.63gMJ-1 m-2 in 2014 and 2015, respectively. In general, the crop growth rate was higher in the first year than in the second year due to the fewer cloudy days and more incident radiation. Conclusion. Results indicated that duration of growth, crop growth rate, and harvest index were crucial for enhancing biomass and seed yield. Also, a relatively high correlation was found between the RUE and DLAImax. The cultivars that reached their maximum LAI later demonstrated higher RUE, and consequently had higher biological and seed yield. The results obtained could be used to develop an improved canola crop growth model and breeding programs. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	8	3518	3528	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11094					FSTA:2021-09-Js11975
J		Abbas, K. A.; Abdelmontaleb, H. S.; Hamdy, S. M.; Ait-Kaddour, A.							Physicochemical, functional, fatty acids profile, health lipid indices, microstructure and sensory characteristics of walnut-processed cheeses.		Foods					In the present study, processed cheeses fortified with walnut paste (a high source of omega-3 fatty acids) were developed and characterized. In order to identify the best cheese formulation, the effects of different proportions of walnut paste (0, 5, 10, and 15%) on cheese physicochemical, functional, fatty acids profile, health lipid indices (atherogenic and thrombogenic), microstructure, and sensorial characteristics were studied. Results showed that walnut-added samples had significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher levels of acidity, protein, fat, and ash contents with lower meltability and oil separation index compared to the control. Processed cheeses with walnuts contained significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher percentages of MUFAs, and omega-3 PUFAs (mainly alpha-linolenic acid) and significantly (p≤0.05) lower amounts of SFAs (mainly myristic, palmitic and stearic acids) and omega6/omega3 ratio. Scanning Electron Micrograph of processed cheese containing walnut paste showed uniform distribution of walnut in the protein matrix. Processed cheeses made with 5 or 10% walnut paste presented the most acceptable sensory properties. These results indicated that walnut paste supplementation can be used as a nutritional strategy to increase concentrations of human health-promoting fatty acids in processed cheeses while maintaining good sensory and technological properties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abbasali Jannatizadeh; Roghayeh Aminian-Dehkordi; Farhang Razavi							Effect of exogenous melatonin treatment on Aspergillus decay, aflatoxin B1 accumulation and nutritional quality of fresh "Akbari" pistachio fruit.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms activated by melatonin treatment for attenuating Aspergillus decay, suppressing aflatoxin B1 (AB1) accumulation, and preserving nutritional quality in fresh pistachio fruits during storage at 25 °C for 18 days. At 6-day intervals, samples from each of three replications were selected, and subjected to biochemical analysis. Our results showed that fresh pistachio fruits treated with 1,000 M melatonin and inoculated with Aspergillus flavus, exhibited lower Aspergillus decay accompanied by lower endogenous AB1 accumulation. Melatonin treated fruit also showed lower H2O2 and malondialdehyde accumulation during storage. Furthermore, higher linolenic acid accumulation accompanied by higher phenols and flavonoids accumulation as well as superior DPPH scavenging capacity in fresh pistachio fruits treated with 1,000 M melatonin, could be ascribed to lower lipoxygenase and higher phenylalanine ammonia-lyase enzymes activity, respectively, during storage. Besides, melatonin applying at 1,000 M suppressed spore germination and germ tube elongation in A. flavus. Practical applications. Aflatoxin B1 (AB1) accumulation as carcinogenic mycotoxin in pistachio fruits during Aspergillus flavus infection have been considered as a risk for human health. Since ROS generating from kernels could be responsible for triggering A. flavus growth and AB1 biosynthesis. Therefore, alleviating oxidative stress by melatonin treatment not only could be operative for attenuating fungal decay and decreasing AB1 accumulation but also could be favorable for maintaining the quality of fresh pistachio fruits. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15518					FSTA:2021-10-Js13804

Genotype by environment interaction for physiological traits in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) parents and hybrids using additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model.		European Food Research and Technology					The objective of this study was to assess genotype by environment interaction for 21 physiological traits in sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) parents and hybrids grown in Rodasht Agricultural Research Station in Iran by the additive main effects and multiplicative interaction model. The study comprised of 51 sugar beet genotypes [10 multigerm pollen parents, four monogerm seed parents and 36 F1 hybrids], evaluated at four environments in a randomized complete block design, with three replicates. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction analyses revealed significant environment main effects with respect to all observed traits, except extraction coefficient of sugar. The additive main effects and multiplicative interaction stability values ranged from 0.009 (G17 for leaf Ca2+) to 9.698 (G09 for extraction coefficient of sugar). The parental forms 2 7233-P. 29 (G38) and C CMS (G49) as well as hybrids 2 (6) *C (G27) and 5*C (G33) are recommended for further inclusion in the breeding programs because of their stability and good average values of observed traits. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Recovery of phenolic compounds from agro-industrial by-products: evaluating antiradical activities and immunomodulatory properties.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Grape pomace (GP), spent coffee grounds (SCG), tomato pomace (TP) and red corn cobs (RCC) were collected and polyphenols were extracted by optimizing ethanol solvent extractions. Subsequently, extracted phenolic acids, flavonoids and anthocyanins were completely characterized by HPLC, HPLC-DAD and LC-ES-MS. Antiradical activity (DPPH) and anti-inflammatory assays (IL-8 cytokine gene expression in the Caco-2 cell line) were then investigated. Results. Indicated a total polyphenol content for the by-products in the range: 4.64 0.31-22.77 0.65 mg gallic acid equivalent g-1 dry weight, and an antiradical activity in the range: 21.47 0.09-89.76 0.24 muM Trolox equivalent g-1 dry weight. The best anti-inflammatory performances were reported for SCG and GP and they were due to the high flavonoid contents, playing phenolic compounds a minor role. Taking into consideration the results above reported and the information related to the by-products studied, i.e. geographical provenience, daily availability and biomass potential preservation, the agro-industrial wastes were ranked for their suitability to be potentially upgraded to industrial level in the following order: spent coffee grounds >> grape pomace > red corn cobs >> tomato pomace.

Exploring the isomeric precursors of olive oil major secoiridoids: an insight into olive leaves and drupes by liquid-chromatography and fourier-transform tandem mass spectrometry.		Foods					Secoiridoids play a key role in determining health benefits related to a regular consumption of extra-virgin olive oil (EVOO), in which they are generated from precursors of the same class naturally occurring in drupes and leaves of the olive (Olea europaea L.) plant. Here, reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization and Fourier-transform single/tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-ESI-FTMS and MS/MS) was employed for a structural elucidation of those precursors. The presence of three isoforms in both matrices was assessed for oleuropein ([M-H]- ion with m/ z 539.1770) and was emphasized, for the first time, also for ligstroside (m/z 523.1821) and for the demethylated counterparts of the two compounds (m/ z 525.1614 and 509.1665, respectively). However, only the prevailing isoform included an exocyclic double bond between carbon atoms C8 and C9, typical of oleuropein and ligstroside; the remaining, less abundant, isoforms included a C=C bond between C8 and C10. The same structural difference was also observed between secoiridoids named elenolic acid glucoside and secoxyloganin (m/ z 403.1246). This study strengthens the hypothesis that secoiridoids including a C8=C10 bond, recently recognized as relevant species in EVOO extracts, arise mainly from specific enzymatic/chemical transformations occurring on major oleuropein/ligstroside-like precursors during EVOO production, rather than from precursors having that structural feature. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abbey, L.; Ofoe, R.; Rao Gunupuru, L.; Ijenyo, M.							Variation in frequency of CQA-tested municipal solid waste compost can alter metabolites in vegetables.		Food Research International					The use of compost to enhance plant growth and mineral nutrients composition are extensively studied but not much literature information exists on its influence on plant metabolic profiles. A study was performed to assess a 5-year variable frequency of application of Compost Quality Alliance tested municipal solid waste (MSW) compost effect on metabolic profiles of the edible portions of four different vegetable plants. The plants were lettuce (Latuca sativa cv. Grand Rapids), beets (Beta vulgaris cv. Detroit Supreme), carrot (Daucus carota cv. Nantes) and green beans (Phaseolus vulgaris cv. Golden Wax) grown under a sub-humid continental climate. The treatments were annual, biennial and no (control) applications of the MSW compost. Typically, soil fertility highly increased with the annual application of the MSW compost followed by the biennial application but declined in the control plot. The annually applied MSW compost increased total amino acids in the lettuce, carrot, beets, and green beans by ca. 323%, 109%, 94% and 18% respectively, compared to the control. Overall, total phospholipids were enhanced by the biennially applied MSW compost. Total organic acids in the lettuce, beets, and green beans were altered by the annual and biennial MSW compost applications by ca. 35% and 23%; 6% and 6.4%; and 22% and 65%, respectively compared to the control. A 2-dimension principal component analysis biplot confirmed positive association between the different frequencies of MSW compost application and soil fertility enhancement of plant metabolites. In conclusion, the annual application of MSW compost enhanced amino acids, phospholipids, acylcarnitines, amines and choline but reduced glucose in the lettuce, beets, carrot, and green beans. Further studies to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning such biofortification will be required.

A.; Chengnan Zhang; Yuling Lin; Benariba Kaddour; Xiuting Li; Guangsen Fan; Chao Teng; Youqiang Xu; Ran Yang							Nutritive sweetener of short-chain xylooligosaccharides improved the foam properties of hen egg white protein via glycosylation.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The objective of this work was to examined the effect of short-chain xylooligosaccharides (XOS) as sweeteners on the foaming properties and physicochemical and rheological properties of hen egg white protein (EWP) under neutral conditions. The foaming properties, and solubility were determined by spectrometric methods, zeta potential was detected by zetasizer nano instrument, viscosity, rheological behaviors, and coagulation temperature are assessed by dynamic rheometer and protein structure were measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The foaming properties of the EWP-XOS complex were higher than those of EWP alone due to changes in the molecular structure of the protein. In addition, this study also showed that the physicochemical and rheological properties related to the foaming properties of EWP, including the solubility, zeta potential, viscosity, and elastic behavior, were increased by XOS addition. Furthermore, XOS supplementation increased the coagulation temperature of EWP due to improvements in the thermal stability of the protein. Alterations in the above properties may be due to EWP and XOS interactions via glycosylation, which were confirmed by FTIR analysis. The present study suggested that XOS enhanced the foam properties of EWP and therefore improved its application as a functional ingredient in foam-type food manufacturing or functional foods. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1341	1348	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00731-7					FSTA:2021-10-Qa0698

Optimization of extraction parameters, characterization and assessment of bioactive properties of Ziziphus lotus fruit pulp for nutraceutical potential.		European Food Research and Technology					Ziziphus lotus fruits are consumed as food around the world and are highly valued for their distinctive flavor, nutritional and medicinal function. The functional properties of this fruit are attributed to the richness of bioactive compounds. Unfortunately, the extraction of these compounds and their inherent phytochemical characterization is rarely investigated under optimal extraction conditions. In this study, Z. lotus fruit pulp extracts rich in useful biocompounds in terms of its compositional and nutraceutical potential were obtained using heat-assisted extraction and response surface methodology. The optimal conditions were time: 71 min, temperature: 50 °C, solid to solvent ratio: 1:60 (g/mL) and ethanol concentration: 50% which gave 48.62% of yield, 106.64 mg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) /g dry matter (DM) of reducing capacity with the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (FCR), 49.65 mg quercetin equivalent (QE) /g DM of total flavonoid content (TFC), 179.33 mg Trolox equivalent (TE) /g DM of DPPH scavenging activity (DPPH), 150.02 mg TE/g DM of Ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) and 108.76 mg ascorbic acid equivalent (AAE) /g DM of total antioxidant activity (TAA). Under these conditions, a total of 38 compounds were identified using LC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Furthermore, results showed that optimized extracts of Z. lotus fruit pulp possess good antibacterial activity. This study provides essential information of the potential application of useful and cost-effective method to recover bioactive compounds from Z. lotus fruit pulp that can be used as ingredient in functional food and nutraceutical products. © This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply 2021.										2021	247	9	2193	2209	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03779-x					FSTA:2021-12-Jg16038

Cardioprotective effects of Gynura procumbens extract on oxidative status and myocardial injury in rats with isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction.		International Food Research Journal					Gynura procumbens (GP) grows abundantly in Southeast Asia. The present work was conducted to investigate the cardioprotective potential of ethanol extract of GP on cardiac markers, antioxidant levels, and histopathology of isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction (MI). A total of 36 adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups. Treatments were given via oral gavage for 28 days: two groups were given normal saline 0.9%; two groups were given GP250 mg/kg/day-and two groups were given GP500 mg/kg/day. On day 27 and 28, MI was induced with a subcutaneous injection of 85 mg/kg isoproterenol. The rats were sacrificed 48 h after the 1st injection. Cardiac markers, lipid peroxidation, oxidative status, and histopathological analyses were evaluated. Isoproterenol significantly increased the levels of troponin T, creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CKMB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and malondialdehyde (MDA), whereas the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were significantly decreased. In addition, the histopathological findings showed a necrosis of the myocardium as evidenced by neutrophil infiltration, and interstitial oedema with acceleration of apoptosis in MI. Interestingly, treatment with GP restored the levels of troponin T, LDH, MDA, SOD, and catalase significantly. Moreover, GP preserved the myocardial architecture while decreasing both necrosis and apoptosis. GP has the potential to limit myocardial injury after MI, and this is most likely achieved through its modulation of antioxidant enzyme activities.										2021	28	6	1223	1232	1985-4668									FSTA:2022-05-Jq5990

Intermittent frying effect on French fries in palm olein, sunflower, soybean and canola oils on quality indices, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE), glycidyl esters (GE) and acrylamide contents.		Food Control					This study was carried out to determine the effect of intermittent frying of French fries using four different types of frying media on the media quality as well as 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol esters (3-MCPDE) and glycidyl esters (GE) in frying oils and acrylamide contents in finished product. A total of 80 h of heating (control) and frying experiments at 180 °C was conducted, from which the heated and frying oil samples, as well as French fries were collected every day for 10 consecutive days. The oil samples were subjected to oil quality assessment as well as 3-MCPDE and GE in oils and acrylamide content in fried foods. A significant reduction of more than 80% in the 3-MCPDE content of palm olein was observed as compared to the other oils. The final 3-MCPDE levels in all oils were below 0.5 mg kg-1; whilst the GE levels were between 0.5 and 2.0 mg kg-1. For acrylamide analysis, oil type and lipid oxidation profile play an important role in the acrylamide concentration in the fried products. As for oil quality parameters, palm olein showed better frying performance due to the fact that it contains balanced proportion of saturated and unsaturated fatty acid composition. Edible oils with high unsaturated fatty acid are more susceptible to oxidation. In general, frying conditions affect the formation of 3-MCPDE and GE in all oils under extended frying time.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Total Polar Compound (TPC) analysis was used to evaluate fry life cycle of oils and shortenings with differing fatty acids compositions, and to understand if longer trisaturated material (Tribehenin), could influence total fry life, during protracted, semi-continuous deep frying simulations. Results. Showed, when TPC reached 25% max, the TOTOX and FFA revealed correlated values. However, both FFA and Totox were deemed unreliable indicators of oil quality. TPCs were more acutely accurate, especially during oil filtration and top-up procedures, where peak TPC onset showed stronger correlation for assessing oil degradation. Unsaturated frying oil, SBO (PUFA based), resulted with the shortest fry life of 132 fry-cycles; POL (MUFA based) 138 fry-cycles and MPS (MUFA based + Tribehenin) achieving up to 146 fry-cycles, suggesting Tribehenin may apparently extend fry life longevity. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	8	3903	3913	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15007					FSTA:2021-11-Ne2712

Mycotoxins were extracted using a modified QuEChERS method with little sample preparation excluding clean-up and enrichment procedures. Linearity was demonstrated for the five mycotoxins in the range 0.125-20 g/kg. This method shows negligible matrix effect for individual concentrations, thus allowing the use of an external standard procedure. Limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.45 to 1 mug/kg. Recoveries between 63% and 89% were achieved. The intra-and inter-day precisions were lower than 15%. The applicability of the method was demonstrated, taking into account fitness for purpose, with simplicity, reliability, low costs and environmental friendliness.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The present study describes a simple and rapid method for the determination of aflatoxins in almonds using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Aflatoxins were extracted using a modified QuEChERS method with little sample preparation, excluding the use of laborious purification procedures. Extracts were frozen overnight to separate the majority of lipids. The method was successfully validated for almonds. Linearity was demonstrated in the range 0.125-20 g/kg. Limits of quantification (LOQ) ranged from 0.34 to 0.5 mug/kg. Matrix effect was not significant for the aflatoxins. Satisfactory recoveries were obtained at spike levels below 1 mug/kg and between 1 and 10 mug/kg. Relative standard deviations (RSDs) of repeatability and reproducibility were below 15%. The method was successfully tested with two proficiency tests in almond powder and peanut paste, with acceptable z-scores (-2≤z≤2). Only one of 11 local almond samples contained detectable aflatoxins, at concentrations below the maximum permitted level. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	9	1561	1570	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1925167					FSTA:2022-01-Js0039

Toward the enrichment of dietary proanthocyanidins: in vitro investigation of their concentration-dependent complexation with beta-casein.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Considering the proanthocyanidins" (PA) potential health effects, nutritional, and organoleptic properties, their structure should be carefully preserved during food technological processing. Particularly, their interaction with proteins, leading to complex formation, alters their functional performance. In this context, proanthocyanidins-rich persimmon and pomegranate peels were used to investigate the effect of variable PA/beta-casein relative concentrations on their in vitro interaction. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to Diode Array Detector (HPLC) analyses showed that, using 0.008,0.017,0.028, and 0.035 mg catechin equivalent (CE) per milliliter of PA in the reaction medium, the proanthocyanidin-beta-casein interaction's potencies varied, respectively, from 29.12% versus 27.70%, 37.64% versus 33.04%, 16.44% versus 44.60% to 15.96% versus 38.73% (p<.05) with regards to pomegranate versus persimmon peel starting material. Moreover, Size-Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) technique confirmed those findings. From the technological point of view, the relative concentration of PA-protein should be considered to manage their interaction, thus, saving the aliment nutritional values as well as sensorial traits, particularly, astringency and haze formation. Practical applications. From the technological point of view, this work shows how proanthocyanidin-protein" relative concentration should be considered to manage their interaction, thus, saving the aliment nutritional values as well as sensorial traits, particularly, astringency and haze formation. The pick of appropriate concentrations will be assumed to enhance the proanthocyanidin content of beverages and foods, during natural product handling by diminishing their inevitable adsorption to proteins, and so, avoiding haze formation. Additionally, in winemaking, targeting the fitting concentrations can be extremely useful since that winemakers can apply proteins as fining agents which can bind tannins molecules and precipitate them out as sediments to have a softer and less tannic taste. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.14992					FSTA:2021-05-Pa2776

Semi-modified okara whey diet increased insulin secretion in diabetic rats fed a basal or high fat diet.		Food Science and Biotechnology					Lifestyle and diet preferences are primarily responsible for developing type 2 diabetes. In this study, okara was manufactured into okara whey crackers (OWC) to investigate its dietary role in controlling diabetes in streptozotocin-diabetic rats with and without a high-fat diet. Forty-eight rats were divided into eight groups. G1-G4 were nondiabetic and fed a basal diet, a basal diet with 30% crackers, high fat diet, and a high-fat diet with 30% crackers, respectively. G5-G8 were diabetic groups that received similar diets as previous groups. Blood glucose, liver function, lipid pattern, pancreas and liver histopathology, and insulin immunohistochemistry were performed. OWC improved measured parameters and histopathology of the liver and pancreas in diabetic rats. The area% of positive insulin cells was increased in G6 (5.20%) and G8 rats (2.83%) fed OWC compared to diabetic rats (1.17%). In conclusion, the use of 30% OWC in a semi-modified diet has controlled the hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia associated with diabetes. ©The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2020.

Purification and characterization of peroxidases from garden cress sprouts and their roles in lignification and removal of phenol and p-chlorophenol.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The study aims to evaluate the relation between peroxidases of day-6 garden cress sprouts and phenolic compounds. Three cationic, three anionic, and two unbounded peroxidases were separated from day-6 garden cress sprouts. Cationic (GCP1) and anionic (GCP2) peroxidases were purified with molecular masses of 25 and 40 kDa, respectively. The Km values of GCP1 toward H2O2 and guaiacol were lower than GCP2. The anionic GCP2 exhibited high affinity toward some lignin monomers, sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, cinnamic and ferulic acids. Therefore, GCP2 is considered as a lignin peroxidase and contributed in lignin synthesis. The activity of GCP1 and GCP2 was stable at a wide pH range 5.5-8.0 and 6.0-7.5, respectively. Both peroxidases showed the same thermal stability range 20-50 °C. GCP2 was more resistant against the effect of metal ions than GCP1. GCP2 showed high ability to remove of phenol and p-chlorophenol from effluent compared to GCP1. Practical applications. Generally, garden cress is used as a test plant to conduct biomonitoring of pollution in urban soil on a wide scale because of its simplicity, sensitivity, and cost-effectiveness. Peroxidase is an important antioxidant enzyme, which elevated when plant subjected to pollution. Recently, we reported that the increase of peroxidase activity was strongly correlated with high phenolic content and antioxidant activity during the germination of garden cress. In the present study, anionic peroxidase GCP2 may play an important role in lignification process and removal of phenol and p-chlorophenol from polluted soil/wastewater as well as resisted the harmful effect of heavy metals. Cationic peroxidase GCP1, as a natural scavenger, had high affinity toward H2O2 coupled to oxidation of some plant phenolic compounds suggesting its role in consuming of excess H2O2. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13526					FSTA:2021-05-Jq6695

The influence of quinoa flour addition on the physicochemical, antioxidant activity, textural, and sensory characteristics of UF-soft cheese during refrigerated storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of quinoa flour (QF) addition at different levels (0%, 1.0%, 2.0%, and 3.0%) on the physicochemical, syneresis, antioxidant activity, textural and sensorial characteristics of UF-soft cheeses during refrigerated storage for 30 days. QF-added samples exhibited significantly (p ≤.001) higher level of protein, fat, ash, dietary fiber, total phenolic, and antioxidant activity with lower syneresis than the control cheese. Magnesium, phosphorus, iron, and zinc were higher in the QF-added samples than in control. The syneresis was significantly lower (p ≤.001) in QF-added samples than in control. The texture profile analysis showed that QF-added samples were less soft, more gummy, chewy, and springy than control cheese. Sensory evaluation of cheeses supplemented with 1% or 2% QF had the highest score of overall acceptability since the addition of 3% QF had undesirable effects on consumer acceptability. Practical applications. The addition of 1% or 2% quinoa flour to UF-soft cheese is an option to improve the content of nutritionally important compounds of the product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Moringa oleifera (MO) known as the miracle tree is a famous nutritional source in many countries. In this study, the neuroprotective activity of MO seeds was investigated. Fractions of the 70% ethanol seed extract of MO were injected at a dose of 250 mg kg-1 day-1 to albino rats for 15 days, after-which induction of dementia was done using 100 mg/kg AlCl3 over 30 days. Results revealed that all fractions ameliorated the effects of AlCl3 where methylene chloride and ethyl acetate fractions, containing the major bioactive compound niazimicin (NZ), showed the best activities. Biological investigations proved NZ to be a highly potent neuroprotective drug lead as a first report, by causing a decrease in the levels of malondialdehyde, cholinesterase, nitric oxide (NO) and amyloid beta by 47%, 34%, 53% and 59%, respectively, and increasing glutathione levels by 54%. Molecular docking studies suggested NZ neuroprotective effects to be mediated by inhibition of caspase-3 and inducible nitric oxide synthase enzymes. Practical applications. The current findings present the neuroprotective effect of Moringa oleifera seeds consumed as a food supplement and in daily diet. In addition, niazimicin is a promising lead for the development of novel agents against Alzheimer's disease as seen by the reported results. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Polar reversed-phase liquid chromatography coupled with triple quadrupole mass spectrometer method for simple and rapid determination of maleic hydrazide residues in some fruits and vegetables.		Food Analytical Methods					Maleic hydrazide (MH) is used as a plant growth regulator, herbicide, and sprouting inhibitor for some crops to improve the growth and the quality of some fruits and vegetables so that MH residues should be analyzed in food. Most of the chromatographic analysis methods for MH residues were operated by using ion chromatographic (IC) columns which need complicated with extra washing and conditioning steps. The developed method has overcome this problem by using Synergi polar reversed-phase (RP) column and non-scheduled multiple-reactions monitoring (MRM) scanning modes. Liquid chromatography coupled with negative electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer LC-ESI (-) MS/MS method was developed and validated according to SANTE/12682/2019 at four fortification levels in four food matrices. The method optimization was carried out by using different extracting solvents, LC columns, and mobile phase ratios. The extraction was developed and operated by using 1% formic acid in methanol. The limits of quantification (LOQ) for MH were in the range 0.05-0.1 mug/g that was below the EU maximum residue limit (MRL), set for the studied food matrices such as onion, potatoes, citrus, and grape (15,50, 0.2, and 0.2 mug/g) respectively. Good method linearity was obtained in the concentration range 0.01-2 mug/ml with correlation coefficients (r2)≥0.99. The average recoveries ranged from 84 to 110% with relative standard deviations RSDs≤17%. The matrix effects on the MH signals were studied and compensated by using the standard addition technique. This polar-RP-LC-ESI (-) MS/MS method was developed to help laboratories which determine the MH residues in food. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Chemometrics-based aroma profiling for revealing origin, roasting indices, and brewing method in coffee seeds and its commercial blends in the Middle East.		Food Chemistry					Coffee is among the most consumed beverages worldwide. The present study reports on the aroma composition associated with coffee seeds brewing. Aroma of authentic coffee specimens of Coffea arabica and C. robusta alongside with typical products consumed in the Middle East were analyzed using HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS. In addition, multivariate data analysis (MVA) was employed. Results revealed for 102 volatiles with a distinct aroma profile between the different brewing methods. Infusion demonstrated higher esters level, while decoction and maceration were more abundant in sesquiterpenes and terpene alcohols, respectively. Besides, heat-induced products, i.e., 4-vinyl guaiacol was identified as potential roasting index in instant coffee and roasted C. robusta brews. Blending with cardamom further masked the smoky odor of such compounds by its fragrant terpinyl acetate. This study provides the first report on the chemical sensory attributes of Middle Eastern coffee blends and further reveal for the impact of brewing, roasting on its aroma composition.

Chemical composition and biological activities of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) essential oils and ethanolic extracts of conventional and organic seeds.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Essential oils and ethanolic extracts of seeds of seven organically and conventionally grown accessions (E1, E2, E3, E4, E5, E6, and E7) of fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.) were examined for their chemical constituents, antioxidant and antibacterial activities. Accession E7 presented the highest essential oil yields of 4.300.45 and 3.240.46%, respectively, for organic and conventional mode. However, E6 noted the lowest ethanolic extract yield in the two modes of cultivation. Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the essential oils revealed the presence of nine essential components in all plant materials. (E)-anethole, methyl-chavicol, fenchone, and limonene were highly abundant. A considerable antioxidant effect was shown for all accessions and a significant difference (p<.05) was reported in the mode of cultivation of essential oils and ethanolic extracts. Concerning antibacterial activity, the essential oils showed generally higher antibacterial activity on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria than ethanolic extracts for organic and conventional fennel seeds. Practical applications. Foeniculum vulgare is an aromatic plant widely used nowadays as flavoring as well as food preservative in foods, such as ice cream, meat, and fish dishes. In this context, the chemical composition and biological activities of essential oil and ethanolic extract from fennel seeds cultivated in organic and conventional modes were studied. Fennel seeds extracts presented a richness in polyphenols and flavonoids. In addition, they showed considerable antioxidant activity, while essential oils had a higher antibacterial activity. There is increase demand, nowadays, for such natural and safe products for future applications in the food industries. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15034					FSTA:2021-05-Te1895

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This research aimed to produce triacylglycerols fraction rich in palmitic acid (PA) at the sn-2 position from hard palm stearin (HPS) through acetone fractionation. Fractionations were done at HPS-to-acetone ratios of 1:3, 1:5 and 1:7 (w/v) and at temperatures of 25,30 and 35 °C for 3 h. Triacylglycerols with PA at the sn-2 position, such as tripalmitoylglycerol (PPP) and dipalmitoyl-stearoyl-glycerol (PPS), were concentrated in the solid fraction, obtained after separation by filtration. The optimal fractionation conditions were at a HPS-to-acetone ratio of 1:5 (w/v) and 30 °C. The total PPP and PPS content was more than 91%, with a corresponding yield of more than 59%. Triacylglycerols obtained were composed of more than 91% PA in which 88% were at the sn-2 position. Conclusively, the solvent fractionation is a suited alternative method for the preparation of triacylglycerols used for the enzymatic synthesis of 1,3-dioleoyl-2-palmitoylglycerol which is the main triacylglycerol for human milk fat substitute. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	9	4549	4558	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15206					FSTA:2022-01-Pa0262

Effect of functional beetroot pomace biscuit on phenylhydrazine induced anemia in albino rats: hematological and blood biochemical analysis.		Journal of Functional Foods					The present study incorporated beetroot pomace powder in biscuit preparation at concentrations of 5-20%. Biscuits' chemical composition, and sensory were evaluated. A feeding experiment was conducted using three groups (n=3); control and anemic (An+) groups fed a standard diet, and anemic group fed 90% standard-diet and 10% biscuit containing 15% pomace (AnB). Anemia induced by injecting rats with phenylhydrazine (40 mg/kg) for two consecutive days. Hematological and biochemical blood parameters were determined at days 3, 14, and 28. An enhancement in protein, fiber, calcium, phosphorus, and iron was observed in the biscuit by increasing the pomace. Consuming biscuits containing 15% pomace increased hemoglobin, RBCs, and antioxidant enzymes in (AnB) rats after 28 days. The minor kidney and liver dysfunction in the anemic groups were recovered in (AnB) after 28 days. Consequently, incorporation beet pomace in biscuit revealed a promising role in anemia treatment and oxidative stress managing. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Abdo, M. T.; El-Ahmady, S. H.; Gad, H. A.							Quality control and long-term stability study of ginger from different geographical origins using chemometrics.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Ginger rhizome (Zingiber officinale) is a well-known spice and medicinal plant that is widely used in the Egyptian market as a spice, flavor and medicinal herb for different diseases. Since it is not cultivated as rhizomes in Egypt, ginger is imported from other countries, which may impact its quality. In this study, UV spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were applied as efficient available techniques for the discrimination and quality control of ginger collected from different geographical origins in combination with chemometrics. In addition, HPLC was applied to investigate the stability of ginger samples upon storage for 3years to trace the changes in their main active constituents. Results. Data obtained from both UV and HPLC in combination with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) displayed proper discrimination of the samples according to their geographical origins. Regarding the stability study, ginger samples showed a significant decrease in quality after storage for 3 years, in which significant variation in the main pungent principles (6-, 8-, 10-gingerols and 6-shogaol) were observed. PCA failed to discriminate between ginger samples after long-time storage, so the applied model could discriminate between ginger samples before and after storage. Conclusion. UV and HPLC in combination with chemometrics can be applied as a successful tool for the study of quality, stability and geographical discrimination of ginger. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Abdol-Reza Niazi; Fardin Ghanbari; Javad Erfani-moghadam							Simultaneous effects of hot water treatment with calcium and salicylic acid on shelf life and qualitative characteristics of strawberry during refrigerated storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Strawberry fruits were initially dipped into 1 mM salicylic acid (SA), 2% calcium chloride (CaCl2), and a combination of SA and CaCl2 at two water temperatures of 20 °C (CWT) and 45 °C (HWT) for 5 min and then stored at 4 °C for 14 d. Results. Showed that SA and CaCl2 treatments improved some fruit attributes including antioxidant capacity, total phenolic compounds, vitamin C, and total protein, whereas suppressed malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity. Accordingly, they retarded fruit decay and improved fruit quality during storage. Results. Also revealed that applying hot water (at 45 °C) in simultaneousness with dip treatments interestingly improved fruit quality and diminished fruit's weight loss, as compared with using them at an ambient temperature (20 °C). In conclusion, employing SA and CaCl2 dip treatments along with hot water at 45 °C maintained strawberry's fruit quality more efficiently during storage as compared with using them without hot water. Practical applications. Regarding extending shelf life and improving quality of strawberry at cold storage, we showed that application calcium chloride and salicylic acid in simultaneous with hot water is more efficient rather than their application with cold water. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15005					FSTA:2021-05-Jf6951
J		Abdollahi, K.; Condict, L.; Hung, A.; Kasapis, S.							Binding parameters and molecular dynamics of beta-lactoglobulin-vanillic acid complexation as a function of pH - part A: acidic pH.		Food Chemistry					Protein-phenolic compound interactions are commonly investigated with inappropriate linear equations for the analysis of binding strength and stoichiometry. This work utilises more appropriate protocols for the investigation of molecular interactions between vanillic acid and beta-lactoglobulin at pH 2.4, where the protein predominately exists as a monomer. Non-linear binding and Job plot analysis were conducted on fluorescence data to effectively determine the interaction's dissociation constant (KD, 2.93 * 10-5 M) and stoichiometry (1:1). Furthermore, spectroscopic techniques revealed statistically significant alterations to the conformational characteristics of beta-lactoglobulin upon complexation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support a 1:1 interaction stoichiometry and reveal that the stabilisation of vanillic acid was dynamic in nature but mainly supported by four pi-alkyl interactions and one hydrogen bond, located within the beta-barrel of the monomer. Water molecules, which are generally not accounted for in MD simulation analysis, were shown to be an important factor in the ligand stabilization via bridging interactions.

J		Abdollahi, M.; Haizhou Wu; Undeland, I.							Impact of processing technology on macro- and micronutrient profile of protein-enriched products from fish backbones.		Foods					Impacts of processing technology (mechanical separation and pH-shift processing) on protein recovery from salmon, herring and cod backbones and the content of macro- and micronutrients in the recovered protein enriched products were investigated. Mechanical separation led to higher protein recovery compared with the pH-shift process and using both techniques, recovery ranked the species as herring > salmon > cod. However, the pH-shift process up-concentrated protein from herring and salmon backbones more efficiently than mechanical separation by removing more fat and ash. This consequently reduced n-3 PUFA and vitamin D content in their protein isolates compared with the backbones and mechanically separated meat (MSM). Cod protein isolate, however, contained higher levels of these nutrients compared with MSM. Mechanical separation concentrated vitamins E and C in salmon MSM but not for cod and herring. Opposite, pH-shift processing reduced levels of these two vitamins for cod and herring backbones, while vitamins D and C were reduced for salmon. For minerals, selenium, calcium, magnesium, and potassium were lower in protein isolates than MSM, while copper, zinc, iron and manganese were similar or higher. Overall, there is a major potential for upcycling of fish backbones to food ingredients, but processing technology should be carefully balanced against the desired nutrient profile and final application area. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abdul Aziz, M.; Zahid Ullah; Muhammad Adnan; Soukand, R.; Pieroni, A.							The fading wild plant food-medicines in upper chitral, NW Pakistan.		Foods					The subject of food-medicines (foods ingested in order to obtain a therapeutic activity or to prevent diseases) is garnering increasing attention from both ethnobiologists and ethnopharmacologists as diet-related chronic diseases are one of the major problems resulting in a large proportion of deaths globally, which calls for interest from the scientific community to make sensible decisions in the field of food and medicine. In this regard, the current study is an important attempt at providing baseline data for developing healthy and curative food ingredients. This study aimed at recording the culinary and medicinal uses of wild food plants (WFPs) in the remote Mastuj Valley, located at the extreme north of Chitral District, Pakistan. An ethnobotanical survey was completed via 30 in-depth semi-structured interviews with local knowledge holders to record the food and medicinal uses of WFPs in the study area. A total of 43 WFPs were recorded, most of which were used as cooked vegetables and raw snacks. Leaves were the most frequently used plant part. A remarkable proportion (81%) of use reports for the recorded wild plant taxa were quoted as food-medicines or medicinal foods, while very few were reported as either food or medicines, without any relationship between uses in these two domains. Previous ethnomedicinal studies from nearby regions have shown that most of the recorded wild plants have been used as medicines, thus supporting the findings of the current study. A literature survey revealed that many of the reported medicinal uses (33%) for the quoted WFPs were not verifiable on PubMed as they have not been studied for their respective medicinal actions. We observed that most of the plants quoted here have disappeared from the traditional food and medicinal system, which may be attributed to the invasion of the food market and the prevalence of allopathic medicine. However, knowledge of these wild plants is still alive in memory, and women are the main holders of cultural knowledge as they use it to manage the cooking and processing of WFPs. Therefore, in this context, we strongly recommend the preservation of local biocultural heritage, promoted through future development and educational programs, which could represent a timely response to the loss of cultural and traditional knowledge. © 2021 by the authors.

Quality of dabai pulp oil extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide and supplementation in hypercholesterolemic rat-a new alternative fat.		Foods					Dabai pulp oil (DPO) is new oil extracted from the pulp of Canarium odontophyllum. The quality and efficacy of DPO are needed to promote its potential as a new alternative fat. Therefore, we investigate the quality of DPO, which includes moisture and volatile content (MVC), free fatty acid content (FFA), iodine value (IV), and peroxide value (PV). Furthermore, we evaluate the efficacy of DPO against hypercholesterolemia elicited by a high-cholesterol diet in rats. The MVC of DPO was <0.0010.00%. Next, the FFA in DPO was 2.570.03%, and the IV of DPO was 53.740.08 g iodine/100 g oil. Meanwhile, the PV of DPO was 4.970.00 mEq/kg. Supplementation of DPO in hypercholesterolemic rats for 30 days revealed the hypocholesterolemic effect (significant reduction of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase) accompanied by a significant reduction of inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha), and lipid peroxidation (MDA). We also observed a significant improvement of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and antioxidant capacities (total antioxidant status, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase) of the rats. The results on the quality and efficacy of locally made DPO suggest its potential use as a healthy alternative fat in the future. © 2021 by the authors.

Significant differences in gel strength, WHC, and morphological changes have scrutinized among various emulsion gels prepared with laccase cross-linking US-alpha-LA (alpha-LA treated with US pretreatment) and US-alpha-LA. The gel strength of laccase cross-linking US-alpha-LA and US-alpha-LA significantly increased from 201.4 to 274.1 g and 22.8-49.4 g, respectively, with US duration ranged from 0 to 20 min. Furthermore, gel WHC of laccase cross-linking US-alpha-LA and US-alpha-LA also remarkably increased from 91.1 to 95.9 and 61.7-70.8%, respectively. The laccase cross-linking US-alpha-LA and US-alpha-LA had more uniform and denser microstructure than control. Moreover, the emulsion with laccase cross-linking US-alpha-LA gave a self-standing elastic gel, which showed stability for more than one month without showing any separation. In conclusion, the most appropriate combined processing technique to make a stable gel was the moderate US duration (20 min). It had a remarkable impact on physicochemical and microstructural attributes of emulsion gel, producing better substrates for laccase. Our obtained results suggested that for functionality modification of the globular protein, ultrasound pretreatment combined with laccase is an effective method.

J		Abdul Rasheed, H.; Tuhanguli Tuoheti; Zhiyu Li; Tekliye, M.; Yongzhu Zhang; Mingsheng Dong							Effect of novel bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus fermentum BZ532 on microbiological shelf-life and physicochemical and organoleptic properties of fresh home-made bozai.		Foods					Bacteriocinogenic Lactobacillus fermentum BZ532 with novel bacteriocin LF-BZ532 was originally isolated from Chinese cereal fermented drink, showing an antimicrobial characteristic during fermentation. This study aimed to explore the in situ antimicrobial activities of L. fermentum BZ532 and co-culturing investigation against key food pathogens, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli K-12, was conducted during fresh bozai production. The growth of spoilage bacteria was suppressed and bacterial count was reduced to a significantly low level during 48 h of co-cultures. In situ production of antimicrobial compounds expressed positive activity against S. aureus and E. coli K-12, but negative acitivity against Salmonella sp. D104. The total viable count of bozai BZ-Lf (bozai fermented with BZ532 strain) had a comparatively lower viable count than bozai BZ-C (bozai as an experimental control without BZ532) during storage of 7 days. Titratable acidity of bozai treatments (BZ-C, BZ-Lf) was increased, while pH declined accordingly during storage of 7 days. The organoleptic quality of bozai BZ-C had low sensorial scores as compared with BZ-Lf during storage. In comparison with naturally fermented bozai (BZ-C), L. fermentum BZ532 (BZ-Lf) could significantly reduce the microbial spoilage and extend the shelf-life based on microbiological examination. Conclusively, L. fermentum BZ532 can be used as a bio-protective culture for improving the safety of bozai. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abdul Razzaq; Ijaz Ahmed, U.; Sarfraz Hashim; Aamir Hussain; Salman Qadri; Sami Ullah; Nawaz Shah, A.; Ali Imran; Attika Asghar							An automatic determining food security status: machine learning based analysis of household survey data.		International Journal of Food Properties					Household food security is a major issue in developing countries like Pakistan. Despite significant breakthroughs in grain production within the country, the problem of food availability and utilization persists. Diet is one of the most potent determinants of nutritional condition. The dietary intake method has been utilized to determine the food security status of households, which depends on various factors. There are no automatic and user-friendly methods available to decide food security status, which is generally determined by manually calculating calorie intakes. Due to its high performance and precision, machine learning holds major significance. In this paper, the status of food security has been examined by applying machine learning algorithms, namely, support vector machine, naive Bayes, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, logistic regression, and neural network, on survey data of households for best predicting the status. A food analysis (FA) app has been developed to automatically predict the FAO status of a household's food security by implementing the random forest model that found higher precision among algorithms. Additionally, the proposed mobile app will also be helpful for collecting the households' data. Furthermore, the objective of the study was to enhance food security awareness among individuals.

J		Abdul Wazed, M.; Mohammed Farid							Pressure assisted thermal pasteurization (PATP) of hypoallergenic and low protein ready-to-feed (RTF) infant formula fortified with bioactives: a novel approach.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Infant Milk Formula (IMF) is an instant alternative to breastfeeding which is being investigated continuously to mimic the composition of human milk. Hypoallergenic IMF is recommended for infants who cannot tolerate cow milk due to allergy. Paediatric obesity resulted in burgeoning demand for low protein infant formula, especially in Asia. Beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), a major cow milk allergen to infants, is present in cow milk as 3-4 g/L, whereas, interestingly, it is absent in human milk. Besides, human milk contains Fe3+ binding lactoferrin (LF) and Ca2+ binding alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-Lac) about 10 and 3 times, respectively, higher than cow milk. Therefore, a mechanism to formulate a hypoallergenic IMF with low protein content could be the addition of LF and alpha-Lac and reducing beta-Lg at the same time using an appropriate processing method. Hence, as a pragmatic approach, this study considered a pasteurized form of ready-to-feed (RTF) by applying Pressure Assisted Thermal Pasteurization (PATP) achieved from HPP of 600 MPa for 15 s applied at 57.1 °C to attain 72.3 °C after pressurization. In parallel, conventional HTST was also applied at 72 °C for both 15 and 30 s to compare PATP's effect. HTST and PATP retained >90% and > 75% LF respectively whereas PATP induced higher retention of alpha-Lac compared to HTST. However, HTST retained >60% beta-Lg while PATP induced a high denaturation of beta-Lg with 28% retention only. Moreover, both PATP and HTST induced around 5 log reduction of E. coli (ATCC 8739) in IMF. Therefore, the current investigation potentially indicates a route to develop a PATP-processed hypoallergenic and low protein RTF formula, a niche product.

Journal of Functional Foods					The present study investigated the cholesterol-lowering activity of xylo- oligosaccharides and its associated underlying mechanisms in hamsters. Twenty-four hamsters were randomly divided into three groups and fed one of three diets, namely a low cholesterol diet, a high cholesterol diet (HCD), and an HCD diet with supplementation of 5% xylo-oligosaccharides for 6weeks. The changes in gut microbiota, fecal neutral and acidic sterols were examined. Results exhibited that xylo- oligosaccharides could significantly reduce plasma total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total triacylglycerol by 11.24%, 24.89% and 38.72%, respectively (p < 0.05). Such benefits were associated with an increase in fecal outputs of neutral and acidic sterols as well as SCFAs. Furthermore, dietary supplementation with xylo-oligosaccharides could change the composition of gut microbiota. It was therefore concluded that xylo-oligosaccharides supplementation could reduce plasma cholesterol levels, enhance the excretion of neutral and acidic sterols, and promote the production of SCFAs via changing the gut microbiota composition.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					In the past decade, the use of marine mussels as seafood is being more popular. They considered being a rich source of various nutritional bioactive compounds that aroused the scientific community's interest. This study investigated the antioxidant and the antithrombotic consequences on Sprague-Dawley male rats after adding dried New Zealand mussel Perna canaliculus in their diet. The biochemical, hematological and histopathological changes were also observed. Forty rats were divided into four groups according to the amount of dried mussels in their diet, in addition to a control group that consumed a basal diet only. Group 1 consumed 25% dried mussels in its basal diet; Group 2 consumed 35% dried mussels in its basal diet, and Group 3 was consumed 45% dried mussels in its basal diet. The biochemical parameters showed improvements in liver function. Interestingly, the lipid profile decreased, especially the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels which were reduced significantly in Group 3 (p<.01). These observations were accompanied by a decrease in iron levels significantly as the amount of dried mussels increased (p<.01). Furthermore, the noticed changes in the hematological profile prove that there is an increase in antithrombotic activity. Dried mussels had potent antioxidant effects in the liver as shown by increased lipid peroxide (p<.05), reduced glutathione (p<.05), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px; p<.05). Additionally, antioxidant activity in the kidney was shown to increase through GSH-Px activity (p<.01). In conclusion, these results indicate that consuming dried mussels resulted in improved biochemical and antioxidants activities and could be used as an antithrombotic agent. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13865					FSTA:2021-12-Re4540

Optimisation of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of Trigona honey and propolis using response surface methodology from fermented food products.		International Food Research Journal					Honey and propolis are honeybee products that are becoming increasingly common as a result of their ability to improve human health. The optimal combination of honey and propolis for total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant capacity were analysed for Trigona honey and propolis aqueous extracts using response surface methodology and a central composite design. The effect of honey (X1: 15-16.5 g) and propolis (X2: 13.5-15 g) on the total phenolic content (TPC, Y1), total flavonoid content (TFC, Y2), antioxidant capacity (DPPH, Y3; ABTS, Y4), and FRAP (Y5) were tested. The experimental outcomes were adequately fitted into a second-order polynomial model regarding TPC (R2=0.9539, p=0.0002), TFC (R2=0.9209, p=0.0010), antioxidant activity (DPPH, R2=0.9529, p=0.0002; ABTS, R2=0.9817, p < 0.0001), and FRAP (R2=0.9363, p=0.0005). The optimal percentage compositions of honey and propolis were 15.26 g (50.43%) and 15 g (49.57%), respectively. The predicted results for TPC, TFC, DPPH (IC50), ABTS, and FRAP were 162.46 mg GAE/100 g, 2.29 mgQE/g, 14.52 mg/mL, 564.27 MTE/g, and 3.56 mMTE/g, respectively. The experimental outcomes were close to the predicted results: 152.060.55 mg GAE/100 g, 2.210.05 mg QE/g, 13.850.34 mg/mL, 555.2236.84 MTE/g, and 3.710.02 mMTE/g, respectively. It was observed that the optimal combination of honey and propolis provided the highest antioxidant yield and can be used as functional foods, cosmetics, and medical and pharmacological ingredients.										2021	28	6	1233	1244	1985-4668									FSTA:2022-05-Lg0743

Food Chemistry					In this study, pectinase-assisted extraction of cashew apple juice was modeled and optimized using a multi-layer artificial neural network (ANN) coupled with genetic algorithm (GA). The effect of incubation time, incubation temperature, and enzyme concentration on different responses such as yield, turbidity, ascorbic acid content, polyphenol content, total soluble solids, and pH was also determined. The developed ANN has minimum mean squared error values of 0.83, 40.92, 29.01, and 8.95 and maximum R values of 0.9999, 0.9972, 0.9995, and 0.9996 for training, testing, validation, and all data sets, respectively, which shows good agreement between the actual and predicted values. The optimum extraction parameters obtained using the developed ANN-GA were as follows: an incubation time of 64 min, incubation temperature of 32 °C, and enzyme concentration of 0.078%. The measured value of responses at the optimized process conditions were in accordance with the predicted values obtained using the developed ANN model. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Abdullah S. Shatoor; Al Humayed, S.; Hussain M. Almohiy							Crataegus aronia prevents high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis in rats by activating AMPK-induced suppression of SREBP1 and activation of PPARalpha.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study examined if the aqueous extract of Crataegus aronia (C. aronia) can prevent high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis in rats by activating AMPK. Adult male Wistar rats were fed either a control diet or HFD for 12 weeks and treated either with vehicle (normal saline) or C. aronia extract (200 mg/kg/orally), daily. Also, hepatocytes were treated with increasing concentrations of the extract in the presence or absence of compound C (CC), an AMPK inhibitor. C. aronia prevented the increase in serum and hepatic lipids, reduced hepatic levels of reactive oxygen species, and increased hepatic glutathione and superoxide dismutase levels. It also downregulated the hepatic expression of SREBP1/2, fatty acid synthase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase but stimulated the activity of AMPK and levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. Similar effects were reported in the cultured cells, in a dose-dependent manner but were prevented by CC. In conclusion, C. aronia ameliorates HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress by activating AMPK. Practical applications. The use of the aqueous extract of Crataegus aronia has been extensively used during the last years in traditional medicine to treat chronic disorders including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The findings of this study support these findings and suggest that oral administration of C. aronia aqueous extract has potent hypoglycemic effect and demonstrate the mechanism of action mimics such drugs such as metformin and involves activation of AMPK and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha. These findings are very encouraging for further biochemical analysis and isolation of active ingredients responsible for these effects to be used in more clinical trials. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13945					FSTA:2022-03-Jg2947
J		Abdullah Sani, M. S.; Mohd Ismail, A.; Azman Azid; Saiful Samsudin, M.							Establishing forensic food models for authentication and quantification of porcine adulterant in gelatine and marshmallow.		Food Control					This study aims at authenticating gelatine sources using the incorporation of amino acid (AA) analysis via Ultra-High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Diode-Array Detector (UHPLC-DAD) with forensic food models such as discriminant analysis (DA) and principal component analysis (PCA). The multiple linear regression (MLR), principal component regression (PCR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were compared to select the best model to (1) quantify the porcine adulterant in non-porcine gelatines and (2) quantify porcine adulterant in fish and bovine gelatine. The method linearity was 37.5-1000 pmol/muL with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.96-1.00 and a total recovery of 85%-111%. The training, testing and validation datasets were established by the AA of fish, bovine and porcine skin gelatines. The DA had successfully classified 100% fish, bovine and porcine gelatines while the PCA identified dominant AA in each gelatine sources. The discriminating model of non-porcine and porcine gelatines (NPPDM) and discriminating model of fish, bovine and porcine gelatines (FBPDM) had 100% correctly classified (1) non-porcine and porcine gelatines and (2) fish, bovine and porcine gelatines. Using the fish and bovine gelatin (PFBG) training dataset, the PCR model was ineffective in quantifying the porcine adulterant in non-porcine gelatines. The MLR was a better model than PCR to quantify porcine adulterant in non-porcine gelatines using porcine adulterant in fish gelatine (PFG) and porcine adulterant in bovine gelatine (PBG) training datasets due to its lower relative error range and average relative error than of the PCR. Likewise, the PCR model of the PFBG training dataset was ineffective to quantify the porcine adulterant, specifically in fish and bovine gelatine. In contrast, the MLR of PFG and PBG training datasets was the best model for quantifying porcine adulterant in fish and bovine gelatines, respectively. The MLR was ineffective to classify porcine gelatine in marshmallow using the PFG training dataset. However, the MLR had successfully quantified porcine gelatine in marshmallow using PFG and PBG training datasets. Since the training, testing and validation datasets were established by the fish, bovine and porcine skin gelatines, the NPPDM, FBPDM and MLR were best applied for these gelatines. This study anticipated that the regulatory bodies might adopt this approach to establish a standard of authentication of gelatine products.

J		Abdullah Sani, M. S.; Bakar, J.; Abdul Rahman, R.; Abas, F.							Antibacterial composition of bioautographic fractions, characteristics, and stability of Carica papaya seed extract.		International Food Research Journal					The present work aimed to evaluate the potential of Carica papaya seed extract (CPSE) as an antibacterial agent against Salmonella Enteritidis, Bacillus cereus, Vibrio vulnificus, and Proteus mirabilis. The bioautography of the CPSE on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates was performed, followed by fractionation of the CPSE by column chromatography using hexane: ethyl acetate (1:1) eluent. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), toxicity, composition, and stability of the crude, fractions, and sub-fractions of the CPSE were evaluated. The bioautographic fractions of the CPSE at MIC of 5.63 mg/mL had shown that hexane: ethyl acetate (1:1) fraction and its sub-fraction 3C (Rf=0.940.03) demonstrated the equivalent MIC value (5.63 mg/mL) with the crude CPSE. However, the hexane: ethyl acetate (1:1) fraction and sub-fraction 3C had higher toxicity (LC50=1.7970.305 and 0.3320.059 mg/mL, respectively) than the crude CPSE (LC50=5.5050.718 mg/mL). Thus, only the crude CPSE was subjected to stability study. The dominant cis-vaccenic acid in sub-fraction 3C demonstrated the lowest MIC against B. cereus (1.41 mg/mL), P. mirabilis (1.41 mg/mL), and S. Enteritidis (0.70 mg/mL) in its pure form. Hence, these results signified the potency of the cis-vaccenic acid as an antibacterial compound from the CPSE. The stability study of the crude CPSE solution showed that at MIC of 5.63 mg/mL, the crude CPSE solution acted as a potent antibacterial agent in acidic condition (pH 4), water activity (Aw) < 0.950, and temperature < 40 °C.										2021	28	3	443	456	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-12-Jg17060

Salmonella inactivation and rapid cooling of fresh cut apples by plasma integrated low-pressure cooling.		Food Research International					Fresh food products, including fruits, vegetables, raw meat, and poultry, have been associated with safety concerns and quality issues, owing to their susceptibility to rapid deterioration and microbial contamination. This research aimed to develop an integrated process to simultaneously cool and decontaminate high moisture food products. Cold plasma (CP), a novel decontamination technology, was integrated with vacuum cooling to develop a plasma integrated low-pressure cooling (PiLPC) process. To evaluate the rapid cooling and microbial inactivation efficacies of the PiLPC process, fresh cut Granny Smith apples and Salmonella entericaserovar Typhimurium ATCC 13311 were used as the model food and microorganism, respectively. The influence of process parameters including treatment time, pressure, and post-treatment storage, on the inactivation of Salmonella on fresh-cut apples was investigated. Inactivation of Salmonellaincreased with treatment time, with a maximum reduction of 3.21 log CFU/g after 5 min of CP treatment at atmospheric pressure. Inactivation of Salmonella after CP treatment at 200 mbar was not significantly different from that at atmospheric pressure for the same treatment time. CP treatment of 3 min at 200 mbar followed by a post-treatment storage of 3 days at 4 °C reduced the total Salmonella population on cut apple slices by > 6 log CFU/g. The temperature of the cut apples was reduced from room temperature to 2 °C in 3 to 9 min depending on the sample surface area to volume ratio, when the pressure was reduced to 7 mbar. However, this PiLPC process resulted in moisture loss in cut apples. The results of this study indicate the potential of the PiLPC process for rapid cooling and microbial inactivation of fresh food products in a single process.

Effects of urolithins on obesity-associated gut dysbiosis in rats fed on a high-fat diet.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Obesity is a global health concern associated with the dysbiosis of intestinal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the potentials of urolithin A (Uro-A) and urolithin B (Uro-B), two gut microbiota-derived metabolites of ellagitannins, in reducing body weight gain through the modulation of the gut microbiota. We established a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity model in rats that were later administered with either 2.5mg/kg of Uro-A or Uro-B. Serum biochemical parameters were quantified, and changes in the composition of the gut microbial community were analysed using 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Our results showed that the urolithins significantly decreased the body weight in HFD-fed rats and restored serum lipid profile. The taxonomic analysis showed that both Uro-A and Uro-modulated gut microbes related to body weight, dysfunctional lipid metabolism and inflammation. Overall, our results suggest that Uro-A and Uro-B possess anti-obesity properties, which may be related to the modulation of the gut microbial composition. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	72	7	923	934	0963-7486				10.1080/09637486.2021.1886255					FSTA:2022-02-Aj2224
J		Abdur Razzak, M.; Shin Sik Choi							Delineating the interaction mechanism of glabridin and ovalbumin by spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques.		Food Chemistry					The interaction between ovalbumin (OVA) and isoflavonoid glabridin (GB) was investigated using spectroscopic and molecular docking techniques. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed that GB was bound to OVA mainly due to hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic forces. FT-IR spectroscopy showed that the combination of GB and OVA resulted in a decrease in the beta-sheet content of OVA and an increase in the alpha-helix and extended-chain content. All these experimental results were supported and clarified by molecular docking simulations. GB binding was able to inhibit chemical denaturant-induced structural changes in OVA as observed by intrinsic tryptophan and ANS fluorescence. Moreover, GB-OVA complex increased the aqueous solubility of GB by about 4.45 times at pH 7.0. These results provided insights into the interaction between GB and OVA that contributes to the utilization of GB in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Food Science and Technology Research					The beneficial effects of the imidazole dipeptides (IDPs) carnosine (beta-alanyl-L-histidine) and anserine (beta-alanyl-3-methyl-L-histidine) in humans are widely accepted. Meats are a rich dietary source of IDPs. Therefore, accurate and reproducible methods for IDP quantification in meat should be developed to determine the quantity of meat required to ensure IDP intake at physiologically effective levels. In the present study, we attempted to establish a novel method for estimating the IDP content in meats and quantifying IDP in various meat samples. The IDP content in the samples was estimated accurately using the novel homogenization method. We observed that the IDP content of meats differed based on the species of chicken, cooking method, muscle tissue type, and region.										2021	27	2	335	339	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.27.335					FSTA:2021-10-Sn5881

The identified aromas include: 2,4-dimethyl-1,3-dithiolane, 2,5-dimethyl-1,4-dithiane, and 2,6-dimethyl-1,4-dithiane. Interestingly, AGE contains all stereoscopic isomers of each of these components. An aroma recombinant composed of the newly identified acidic odors with other key odorants showed good agreement with the aroma of AGE.										2021	69	3	1020	1026	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06634					FSTA:2021-06-Te2000

Determination of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde levels in poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bottled mineral water using a simple and rapid analytical method.		Food Chemistry					A simple and rapid analytical method was developed for the determination of formaldehyde (FA) and acetaldehyde (AA) contents in water. FA and AA were derivatized by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine in an LC vial for 20 min at room temperature, about 25 °C, and analyzed using LC-MS/MS. The calibration curve exhibited excellent linearity for FA and AA concentrations of 2-150 ng/mL. Recovery tests using ultra-pure water and commercially available PET-bottled mineral water samples showed good trueness and precision. We determined the FA and AA contents in 105 PET-bottled mineral water samples on the Japanese market using this method. FA was detected in 61% of the samples at levels from 2.6 to 31.4 ng/mL, while AA was detected in 68% at levels from 5.3 to 143.5 ng/mL.

J		Abea, A.; Gou, P.; Guardia, M. D.; Banon, S.; Munoz, I.							Combined effect of temperature and oil and salt contents on the variation of dielectric properties of a tomato-based homogenate.		Foods					Tomato-based processed foods are a key component of modern diets, usually combined with salt and olive oil in different ratios. For the design of radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) heating processes of tomato-based products, it is of importance to know how the content of both ingredients will affect their dielectric properties. Three concentrations of olive oil and salt were studied in a tomato homogenate in triplicate. The dielectric properties were measured from 10 to 3000 MHz and from 10 to 90°C. Interaction effects were studied using a general linear model. At RF frequencies, the dielectric constant decreased with increasing temperature in samples without added salt, but this tendency was reversed in samples with added salt. The addition of salt and oil increased the frequency at which this reversion occurred. At MW frequencies, the dielectric constant decreased with increasing temperature, salt, and oil content. The loss factor increased with increasing salt content and temperature, except in samples without added salt at 2450 MHz. Penetration depth decreased with increasing frequency and loss factor. Salt and oil contents have a significant effect on the dielectric properties of tomato homogenates and must be considered for the design of dielectric heating processes. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abebe Desalegn; Gesessew Kibr							Effect of pretreatment and drying methods on the quality of anchote (Coccinia abyssinica (Lam.)) flour.		Journal of Food Quality					Reduction of postharvest losses through improved technique is studied in this work. Pretreatment and drying, in particular, are important methods for using various tuber-based food items to produce intermediate products that increase economic benefit and availability with a longer shelf life in the production and consumption communities. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of pretreatment and drying methods on the proximate composition and physical and functional properties of flour developed from anchote. The treated anchote flour was prepared using hot distilled water for blanching and potassium metabisulphite solution and drying methods (sun, solar, and oven). The obtained data were statistically analyzed using SAS software at (P<0.05). Accordingly, the untreated and sun-dried anchote had greater moisture content (10.34%) than the chemically treated and oven-dried anchote (8.71%). The samples treated with potassium metabisulphite and the solar-drying methods have higher protein content (4.02%) than the blanched and sun-dried samples (3.14%). Samples treated with blanching and solar drying have lower ash content (3.96%) than samples treated with potassium metabisulphite and dried (4.89%). The highest fiber content was recorded for samples treated with blanching and oven-drying methods, with a rating of 4.71%. Sun-dried samples had an increased fat content (1.14%) compared to blanch with all drying methods (0.72%). The untreated and sun-dried flour had lower carbohydrate content (80.95%) than blanched and oven-dried (83.03%). The potassium-metabisulphite-treated and oven-dried samples rated 2.66% with the highest water absorption value. The blanched and oven-dried samples had the lowest oil absorption capacity of 1.71%, a significantly different value from the highest value of 1.98% for the potassium-metabisulphite-treated and solar-dried samples. Oven-dried samples had higher swelling power than solar- and sun-drying methods. The anchote samples treated by blanching methods and dried in the oven had the highest solubility rating of 43.84% and the lowest value of 38.8% for control and sun-dried samples. The sun-dried anchote flour had the highest dispersibility value, which is significantly different from both the oven-dried and solar-dried versions. Along with that, the untreated samples had significantly lower dispersibility values than the potassium-metabisulphite-treated and blanched flour samples. The proximate values of anchote flour were significantly affected by pretreatment and drying methods. Additionally, the main and interactive effect of pretreatment and drying methods influenced the water absorption capacity, oil absorption capacity, swelling power, solubility, and dispersibility significantly. Further research is required to improve flour properties and characterize pasting properties to assess the suitability of the starch for different industrial inputs.

J		Abebe Moges; Chitta Ranjan Barik; Sukumar Purohit; Vaibhav V. Goud							Dietary and bioactive properties of the berries and leaves from the underutilized Hippophae salicifolia D. Don grown in Northeast India.		Food Science and Biotechnology					The physico-chemical, polyphenols, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of berries and mixture of male and female leaves of Hippophae salicifolia were investigated. The mineral, vitamin C, sugar, total protein, and total tannin contents of the berries and the leaves were evaluated. Further, the extracts of berries and mixture of leaves samples obtained by successive solvent extraction were investigated for their polyphenols, antioxidant and antibacterial properties. Total phenolic content was highest in leaves-methanol extract (157.972.09 mg GAE/g) followed by berries-aqueous extract (48.451.94 mg GAE/g), while total flavonoid was predominant in leaves-acetone extract (75.643.21 mg QE/g) and berries-methanol extract (28.932.08 mg QE/g). Gallic acid, caffeic acid, and rutin were the major polyphenols confirmed by HPLC analysis. Berries-aqueous and leaves-methanol extracts showed excellent global antioxidant score. Best antibacterial activity was observed by methanol extracts against eight different strains. Overall, the leaves and berries of Hippophae salicifolia collected from Northeast India exhibited good antioxidant and antibacterial activity and can be utilized by food and pharmaceutical sectors. ©The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	12	1555	1569	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00988-8					FSTA:2022-03-Jg3302
J		Abed Forouzesh; Fatemeh Forouzesh; Samadi Foroushani, S.; Abolfazl Forouzesh							A new method for calculating thiamin content and determining appropriate thiamin levels in foods.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The thiamin content of some foods is inappropriately calculated per 100kcal, 100g or 100mL, or the reference amount customarily consumed (RACC). So, making some food choices based on them to achieve adequate thiamin intake may increase the risks of some chronic diseases. Calculating the thiamin content and determining appropriate thiamin levels based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), and the proposed method were performed in 7990 food items. Making some food choices based on the FDA and CAC per serving (the serving is derived from the RACC) or CAC per 100g or 100mL to achieve adequate thiamin intake exceeded energy needs, which could lead to overweight or obesity. Making some food choices based on the CAC per 100kcal or CAC per 100g or 100mL to achieve adequate thiamin intake did not meet thiamin requirements, which could lead to thiamin deficiency. Some foods that met thiamin requirements were not appropriate food choices based on the CAC per 100g or 100mL or CAC per serving to achieve adequate thiamin intake. Making food choices based on the proposed method met thiamin requirements and did not exceed energy needs.

Journal of Functional Foods					Oxidative stress may play an important role in migraine pathogenesis. This randomized controlled trial aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks synbiotic supplementation on the oxidative stress and clinical symptoms of migraine in eighty women. The effect of the intervention on the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxide (NO), oxidative stress index (OSI), total oxidant status (TOS), migraine index (MI), headache diary result (HDR) and migraine headache index score (MHIS) were investigated using bivariate comparison. Synbiotic supplementation improved TAC (381.77 vs 43.17 nmol/ml, P = 0.034), and reduced NO (-4.62 vs 0.55 nmol/ml, P = 0.021), OSI levels (-0.33 vs 0.0009, P = 0.027), and MI (-8.27 vs -3.20, P = 0.013) compared to placebo. A positive correlation between the severity of migraine headache and NO level was observed following synbiotic supplementation (r = 0.44, P = 0.002). Synbiotics may reduce oxidative stress and improve migraine symptoms in women and help as a supplemental therapy in managing migraine headaches.

Sunroot snack bar: Optimization, characterization, consumer perception, and storage stability assessment.		Food Science & Nutrition					This study reports the evolution of phenolics, inulin content, proximate composition, hardness, and sensory characteristics of an inulin-rich healthy snack bar (The Sunroot Snack Bar) over 90 days of storage in refrigerated and room temperature storage. A response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite rotatable design was first employed for optimizing the concentrations of sunroot, potato, and oats. The optimum selected concentrations of sunroot, potato, and oat were 53.99, 37.88, and 5 g, respectively, and a quadratic model was found to yield the best fit. Analysis of variance revealed that a higher sunroot content resulted in more firmness of the bar and higher overall acceptability in sensory trials. Sunroot snack bar samples without flavor (control), sunroot snack bar with cheese flavor (S1), and sunroot snack bar with olive flavor (S2) were then tested for sensory, chemical, phytochemicals, and microbial contents among control, S1, and S2 samples over a 90-day shelf-life study. Results Showed no significant (p<.05) changes in these contents on addition of flavor. An increase in microbial load and the appearance of a bitter taste after 30 days of fresh sunroot storage were observed. No microbial growth was observed in all sunroot snack bar samples during storage at 4 °C, while some microbial growth was observed at 25 °C for 90 days. It was inferred that the high-quality shelf life of the sunroot bar was 90 days at 4 °C, which was shortened to a month if the bars were preserved at 25 °C. There was a significant phenolic and inulin content loss at 25 °C compared with 4 °C in total phenolic component. Based on the results of sensory evaluation, online questionnaire of customer experience, and cost analysis, this study successfully used sunroot tubers for the production of snack bars as a promising new raw material, which was introduced healthily with a suitable price for such product compared with other products in the market. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Abeli, P. J.; Fanning, P. D.; Isaacs, R.; Beaudry, R. M.							Blueberry fruit quality and control of blueberry maggot (Rhagoletis mendax Curran) larvae after fumigation with sulfur dioxide.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Postharvest fumigation of fruits and vegetables is an important tool for managing pests and diseases that can cause devastating loss if not properly controlled. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) may have promise as replacement for methyl bromide, which is expected to be phased out. However, SO2 is known to cause injury to small fruit such as table grapes (Vitis vinifera L.). We extend previous research on SO2 fumigation by focusing on an economically important fruit pest genus and through quantitative and qualitative measurements of highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.) fruit bleaching. This study assesses fruit damage due to SO2 fumigation at concentrations ranging 0-2.2% (v/v) as well as the effectiveness of SO2 as a fumigant prior to cold storage for control of blueberry maggot, Rhagoletis mendax Curran. We show that fruit quality traits such as firmness, total soluble solid content, and titratable acidity are largely unaffected except at the highest SO2 concentration (2.2%). SO2 caused bleaching and discoloration of blueberry fruit in a dose-dependent manner. Damage was also cultivar-dependent, with cv "Bluecrop", and "Jersey" more susceptible than "Draper", "Elliott", and "Liberty". We show that R. mendax can be effectively controlled using a short-term (2 h), high concentration (22,000 muL L-1) SO2 fumigation followed by >14 d of cold storage at 0.5 °C. However, this treatment for control of R. mendax would likely result in damage, affecting fruit marketability. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The development of a broccoli supplemented beer allows obtaining a valuable dietary source of sulforaphane.		Food Bioscience					Beer is a popular fermented beverage made, basically, by water, malted cereals, yeasts, and hops. However, the actual market demands innovative beers with new nutritional and organoleptic properties, achieved, for instance, by the addition of functional ingredients. In this hallmark, the objective of this work was to elaborate a new beer enriched with broccoli florets as a source of bioactive compounds, potentially contributing to human health. As a result, the newly developed broccoli-supplemented beverage exhibited high concentrations of the bioactive isothiocyanates as sulforaphane (SFN) (18.85 mumol/L), while the inactive glucosinolate precursor (glucoraphanin (GR)) was not detected. In addition, during the 150 days storage, SFN was almost stable, just evidencing a slight but significant decrease, reaching a final concentration of 0.80 mumol/L. Besides, the alternative developed beer showed an acceptable sensorial profile. Thus, the present work describes the design and development of a new broccoli-supplemented beer that would constitute a valuable dietary source of health promoting SFN.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present study, the prospect of alternate carbon and nitrogen sources was ascertained for plantaricin (PL) and lactic acid (LA) production from the probiotic lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum CRA52. The alternate carbon sources used in the present study were whey permeate (WP) and palmyra palm sugar (PJ), and the alternate nitrogen source was whey protein hydrolysate (WPH). Experimental use of WP as carbon source and WPH as nitrogen source led to enhanced production of LA and PL, with the yield being 17.69 gL-1 and 462.32 AUmL-1 respectively. WP and WPH concentration ratio of 2:1 was found to be optimal for the production of PL and LA. Kinetic modeling revealed that Aiba substrate inhibition model exhibited best fit for the experimental data. On performing a medium based process economic analysis, WP and WPH-based medium were economical for the production of LA. The present investigation validates the potential of WP-WPH based medium for heightened economical production of PL and LA. It is envisaged that this study will lend fundamental insights in order to leverage the innate nutritional potential of raw products such as PJ and WP for economical production of industrially relevant products.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present study aimed at optimizing the parameters for increasing vitamin D2 content along with other nutraceutical properties (beta-glucans, antioxidants, total phenols, flavonoids, and amino acid contents) in dried mushroom Lentinula edodes (L. edodes) powder using ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation. The dried mushroom powder was irradiated for different time durations (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 h). HPLC studies indicated a significant (p < 0.05) increase in vitamin D2 (24.94-49.31 mug/g) content in 2 h irradiated sample. An elevated level of total phenols (6.57-8.84 mg GAE/g), total flavonoids (1.55-2.89 mgQE/g), and beta-glucan content (41.20-47.74%) along with improved antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP) in the 2 h UVB treated sample was also observed. GCMS profiling revealed the presence of bioactives reported to have medicinal potential. Additionally, the study also targets the alterations made by irradiation in amino acid and color profile. The present study provides a sustainable strategy to improve the nutraceutical potential of dried edible mushroom powder, in terms of antioxidant activities, bioactive constituents, etc., particularly vitamin D2, which holds a significant place in the diet.

J		Abhipriya Patra; Abdullah, S.; Chandra Pradhan, R.							Microwave-assisted extraction of bioactive compounds from cashew apple (Anacardium occidenatale L.) bagasse: modeling and optimization of the process using response surface methodology.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study explores the impact of microwave treatment on bioactive compounds of cashew apple bagasse (CAB). The primary objective was to develop a process with optimized conditions for the microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) of bioactive compounds from CAB with maximum yield using a Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology. The independent variables were microwave power (280 to 580 W), treatment time (30 to 120 s), and bagasse/solvent ratio (1:15 to 1:30 w/v). The ANOVA results showed that total phenolic content, DPPH radical scavenging activity, protein content, tannin content, and ascorbic acid content were impacted, in different intensities, by all the independent parameters with a good agreement between the predicted and experimental values. Microwave power of 560 W, treatment time of 110 s, and bagasse/solvent ratio of 1:30 (w/v) were obtained as the optimum conditions for maximum extraction of total phenolic content (41.01 2.11 mg GAE/g), antioxidant activity (91.96 0.92% radical scavenging activity), protein content (166.25 2.75 mg/g), tannin content (81.17 1.84 g tannic acid/g), and ascorbic acid content (2.39 0.62 mg/g). Moreover, while compared to untreated extraction, microwave treatment significantly increased the yield of all the bioactive compounds and minerals content of CAB. Hence, this could be a promising technology for the extraction of bioactive compounds from CAB. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4781	4793	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01042-1					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0748
J		Abhipriya Patra; Abdullah, S.; Chandra Pradhan, R.							Application of artificial neural network-genetic algorithm and response surface methodology for optimization of ultrasound-assisted extraction of phenolic compounds from cashew apple bagasse.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This study explores the effect of ultra-sonication on the extraction of phenolic compounds of cashew apple bagasse (CAB). The extraction was conducted at different combinations of treatment time (5-15min), ultrasound amplitude (30-60%), and bagasse to solvent ratio (30-50g/ml) for maximum yield of total phenolic content (TPC), total tannin content (TTC), and beta-carotene content. Both response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to model and optimize the process parameters. The optimum conditions achieved using RSM were: treatment time of 12min, ultrasound amplitude of 55%, and bagasse to solvent ratio of 45g/ml. In contrast, the optimum conditions proposed by ANN were: treatment time of 15min, 60% amplitude, and 50g/ml bagasse to solvent ratio. The TPC, TTC, and beta-carotene content was determined under RSM optimized conditions as 29.04mg GAE/g, 26.70mug tannic acid/g, and 18.12mug/g, respectively and under ANN optimized conditions as 30.61mg GAE/g, 30.80mug tannic acid/g, and 19.50mug/g, respectively. All the statistical parameters showed the lowest value in the ANN model than the RSM model with the highest coefficient of determination (R2). The measured value of the TPC, TTC, and beta-carotene content at optimized conditions were in agreement with the predicted value obtained from the above models. Besides these, the ultra-sonication significantly increased the TPC, TTC, and beta-carotene content while comparing with conventional solvent extraction. Hence, this method could be an effective green method over conventional technologies to extract phenolic compounds from CAB. Practical Applications. The by-products of the cashew apple processing industries are generally discarded as waste even though it contains a significant amount of bioactive compounds including phenols. Due to this, the industries are facing issues related to waste disposal and environmental pollution. Extracting and utilizing beneficial phenolic compounds can solve these issues to an extend. However, the scientific research related to the process development for extracting phenolic compounds from cashew apple bagasse is very scarce. The developed green technology with optimum process conditions will be helpful for the industries, researchers, and food scientists to develop different value-added products enriched with the extracted phenolic compounds. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	10			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13828					FSTA:2022-02-Jg1729

Evaluation of antimicrobial and antioxidant efficacy of hydro ethanol extract of peels of Kufri Chandramukhi, Kufri Chipsona-3, and Kufri Jyoti potato varieties alone and in combination.		Journal of Food Safety					The potato processing industries generate substantial quantities of phenolic-rich potato peels as waste by-products that could be valuable natural sources of antimicrobials and antioxidants in food industry. The present study is aimed to evaluate antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of hydro ethanol extract of peels of three commonly used potato varieties (Kufri Chandramukhi, Kufri Chipsona-3, and Kufri Jyoti) alone and in combination along with cytotoxicity evaluation. At their individual effect, antimicrobial and antioxidant potential of potato peel extracts were found to be in the following decreasing order: Kufri Chisona-3> Kufri Jyoti> Kufri Chandramukhi. In combination, peel extracts of Kufri Chipsona-3/ Kufri Jyoti blend demonstrated synergistic antimicrobial and antioxidant interactions whereas other tested combinations showed additive antimicrobial and antioxidant effects. The peel extracts of Kufri Chipsona-3/ Kufri Jyoti blend did not show any cytotoxic effect up to 1000mug/ml concentration. Besides, a high positive correlation between total phenolic contents and antimicrobial activity of potato peel extracts was observed. The results provide evidence that hydro ethanol extract of potato peels of Kufri Chipsona-3/ Kufri Jyoti blend may help in designing a more potent safe and effective novel natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	4			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12901					FSTA:2021-12-Jl16249
J		Abhishek Bhattacharya; Wiemann, M.; Stalbrand, H.							beta-Mannanase BoMan26B from Bacteroides ovatus produces mannan-oligosaccharides with prebiotic potential from galactomannan and softwood beta-mannans.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Galactomannan (GM) in legumes and acetyl-galactoglucomannan (AcGGM) in softwoods are wide-spread beta-mannans. Their depolymerisation is catalyzed by beta-mannanases. We have investigated a cell-surface exposed and galactose-tolerant beta-mannanase (BoMan26B) from the abundant gut bacterium Bacteroides ovatus. Glycosidases from the gut microbiota have potential for production of prebiotics, such as dietary saccharides that would promote beneficial bacteria in the gut. BoMan26B was explored for production of potential prebiotics. Using the above beta-mannans as substrate we investigated the product profiles using a herein developed new high-resolution anion-exchange chromatography procedure. The produced linear and galactosyl-decorated beta-mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS/GMOS) were mainly of degree of polymerization (DP) 2-6, consistent with the glycan-binding subsites of BoMan26B. Some GM and AcGGM products were acetylated. DP 2-6 MOS were produced at a yield of 30 and 33% (w/w) from GM and AcGGM, respectively. In addition, about as much DP 2-6 GMOS were produced, assessed using guar alpha-galactosidase as analytical aid. Growth studies using the human gut bacteria Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703 (acetate producer) and Roseburia hominis DSMZ 6839 (butyrate producer) revealed significant differences in utilization of specific MOS/GMOS. The prebiotic potential of the MOS/GMOS generated by BoMan26B was further underlined by the observation that both bacterial strains produced short-chain fatty acids.

J		Abhishek Chandra; Sourabh Kumar; Ayon Tarafdar; Prabhat K. Nema							Ultrasonic and osmotic pretreatments followed by convective and vacuum drying of papaya slices.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Papaya fruit is highly nutritive, but very fragile, and thus has a limited shelf life. Drying is essential to preserve it for longer durations. In this work, osmotic dehydration (OD) with and without ultrasound (US) was applied to papaya slices as a pretreatment in conjugation with vacuum (VD) and convective air drying (AD). Drying was carried out in a novel dryer. Moisture content, drying time, water activity, total color change, total phenolic content, radical scavenging activity, texture, and Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectrums were evaluated for fresh and dried papaya slices. Results. It was observed that US-assisted osmotic dehydration (USOD) followed by VD had the lowest drying time with highest retention of phenols and antioxidants as compared to other drying techniques. Higher phenols and antioxidants in US-pretreated samples were attributed to the release of trapped intra-cellular polyphenols by cavitation. However, the color characteristics and texture of OD pretreatment followed by convective AD slices were found to be better. Color retention could be due to carotenoid preservation, which would be degraded in other treatments, whereas lower brittleness was associated with lower pectin. Infrared spectroscopy confirmed the retention of phytochemicals and antioxidants in dried papaya slices that were subjected to pretreatment. Conclusion. Pretreatment before drying enhances the end product quality of dried papaya slices.

Food Quality and Preference					A number of studies have now examined the in/out effect, whereby "inwards" spoken words imitating an inwards articulatory motion (akin to the swallowing motion) are typically rated higher on dimensions of edibility, palatability, likeability, approach and willingness to pay. The reverse is true of so-called "outwards" words mimicking oral expulsive motion. This effect, though robust and replicable, fails to take into account other well-known sound symbolic associations, which have also been shown to affect the perceived meaning of words, especially in the taste dimension. If outwards (vs. inwards) words are perceived as less palatable and less likeable, the in/out effect would suggest they would lead to expectations of an unpleasant taste. However, taking our cue from the sound symbolism theory, we provide evidence to the contrary. Specifically, we show that phonemic sounds (soft or harsh) contained within these words can override the in/out effect. Across two studies, we found that words with an outwards (vs. inwards) pattern were in fact rated as sweet (vs. bitter) and round (vs. angular) based on the nature of the embedded phones. We also demonstrate that the results significantly differ when the number of phonetic sounds (soft vs. harsh) are varied within the same category of words. Together, our results demonstrate that sound symbolism overrides the in/out effect in sound-taste and sound-shape associations.

Impact of grape variety, berry maturity and size on the extractability of skin polyphenols during model wine-like maceration experiments.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Skin cell walls modulate anthocyanin and tannin extraction from grape skins. However, relationships between the composition of alcohol-insoluble cell wall solids (AIS) and extraction are still unclear. Our objectives were to characterize the impact of variety, berry size and ripeness on skin AIS composition (polysaccharides, proteins) and polyphenol extraction during maceration. Results. Grape skin composition and its impact on polyphenol extraction was compared for two varieties-Carignan and Grenache-with skins of berries sorted according to their size and density. Extractions were performed under model wine-like maceration conditions. Fresh skins had similar content of polymeric tannins, but strongly differed in their anthocyanin content (higher in Carignan and in the ripest berries) and composition (higher proportions in coumaroylated anthocyanins in Carignan). Anthocyanin extraction was proportionally much higher in Grenache, which was not just related to the Carignan's higher levels in coumaroylated anthocyanins. Chemical reactions decreased anthocyanin concentrations in solution for both varieties. Tannin extraction for Grenache was slightly higher and faster than for Carignan. Skin AISs differed slightly between the two varieties in their carbohydrate composition and protein content, but not between modalities. Polyphenol analyses in the precipitates evidenced at the end of the maceration and in residual skins highlighted differences between the two varieties and between berries with different ripeness. Conclusion. Structural information on the cell wall network and on its changes during maceration, along with a better understanding of the chemical reactions of anthocyanins and tannins, is needed to better relate grape and wine polyphenol composition. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

"Intensification of Vaporization by Decompression to the Vacuum" (IVDV), a novel technology applied as a pretreatment to improve polyphenols extraction from olive leaves.		Food Chemistry					Impact of the "Intensification of Vaporization by Decompression to the Vacuum" (IVDV) on extraction of polyphenols from olive leaves was investigated. Using Response Surface Methodology, the effect of three variables were studied: initial water content of leaves, processing time and steam pressure on total phenolic content (TPC). Extractions of TPC from leaves were achieved either using 100% water as a solvent (w100), or 50% (v/v) aqueous ethanol (w50). Following IVDV pretreatment, TPC yields were enhanced with both solvents by approximately 3 times compared to the negative controls. Furthermore, oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol were intensified by up to 600% and 238% respectively. Antioxidant-antiradical assays revealed higher activities, up to 3.5 times, in extracts from IVDV-treated leaves. Calculation of the extraction indices Zp, reflecting cellular damage, confirmed the beneficial effect of IVDV on the extraction yield. Finally, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) permitted the morphological observation of IVDV-treated as compared to untreated leaves. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Science & Nutrition					The current investigation was performed to explore the nutritional and functional composition of four landlines of barley denoted as LB1 (Gilgit), LB2 (Nagar), LB3 (Skardu), and LB4 (Shigar) from different regions of Gilgit-Baltistan. The samples were examined for nutritional profile and antioxidant attributes. Total phenolic values and total flavonoid results were in the range of 1.2 to 3.1 mg/g and 0.41 to 0.55 mg/g, respectively. Nutritional profile as crude starch, fiber, protein, ash, and fat ranged from 56.3%-50.80%, 16.50%-11.73%, 16.20%-11.53%, 2.8%-2.1%, and 2.63%-1.63%, respectively. The mineral composition in terms of Mg (527-616 mg/kg) was higher in the landlines followed by Ca (312-368 mg/kg), Na (122.6-146.6 mg/kg), Fe (43.3-65.6 mg/kg), and Zn (22.5-26.6 mg/kg). It was concluded that the indigenous barley landlines had immense nutritional potential and functional attributes. Thus, it can be used for value-added food products and the development of cottage industry in the region. © 2021 The Authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii CNCM I-745 in combination with prebiotic inulin on the probiotic survivability, physiochemical properties and stability of ice cream were evaluated. Addition of inulin increased the viability of S. boulardii CNCM I-745 with viable count of 6.16 log CFU/g in the synbiotic ice cream after 120 d of storage. Fermentation with the probiotic yeast and Lactobacillus-Streptococcus (LS) caused significantly (p < 0.05) decreased firmness of ice cream samples, S1-Pro (510.2g) and S2-Pro-LS (492.7g), compared with that (545.9g) of the control S0. However, addition of 1% and 2% inulin recovered the firmness of the synbiotic ice cream, S3-Syn1 (535.3g) and S4-Syn2 (548.3g), respectively. Synbiotic ice cream had improved melting property and stability as indicated by measurements of particle size, zeta potential and multiple light scattering. Among 27 volatile compounds identified in different ice cream formulations, the synbiotic ice-cream with 2% inulin contained higher concentrations (3983 mug/L) than S1-Pro (1479 mug/L) and S0-control (616.4 mug/L) ice creams. The synbiotic ice cream of this study represents a potential novel functional product containing probiotic yeast and prebiotic inulin.

Effect of electrostatic interactions and complexes formation between nisin and bacterial exopolysaccharides on nisin antimicrobial efficacy.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aims to describe interactions that may occur between nisin and bacterial exopolysaccharides (EPS) when they are present together in a model solution. For this purpose, two EPS, namely EPS-GM and EPS-BMS, produced by potential probiotic Bacillus tequilensis-GM and Leuconostoc citreum-BMS, respectively, were used. Results. Showed that maximal complexation occurred at pH 5.0 between anionic EPS (1.5 g/L) and cationic nisin (1 g/L) mainly through electrostatic interactions. Results provided by scanning electron microscopy, epifluorescence microscopy and turbidity measurements showed that EPS-GM was able to form bigger and higher amounts of complexes with nisin. The nisin antimicrobial activity was interestingly not affected and even improved after its complexation with EPS suggesting that these latter may act as protective agents of the nisin antimicrobial activity when applied in foods. The results of this study should help food technologists to optimize the physicochemical conditions for optimal formulation of food products containing EPS. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Abida Jabeen; Rashid Naik, H.; Nusrat Jan; Zameer Hussain, S.; Fauzia Shafi; Tawheed Amin							Numerical optimization of process parameters of water chestnut flour incorporated corn-based extrudates: characterizing physicochemical, nutraceutical, and storage stability of the developed product.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present research was undertaken to optimize process conditions for development of water chestnut incorporated corn-based extrudates. The independent extrusion variables-feed composition, feed moisture, screw speed and barrel temperature were studied to determine their influence on dependent variables-specific mechanical energy, expansion index, bulk density, water solubility index, water absorption index, hardness, and color. All system and product responses were significantly (p<.05) influenced by independent variables. The regression models fitted to experimental design showed high coefficient of determination (R2≥0.99). The optimum conditions for development of extrudates obtained by numerical optimization were corn flour: water chestnut flour (60:40), feed moisture (14%), barrel temperature (170 °C), and screw speed (300 rpm). Moisture, protein, and fat contents of extrudates developed using optimum conditions were significantly (p<.05) lower than corn and water chestnut. Storage studies revealed safe storage of extrudates packed in aluminum laminates up to 120 days under ambient conditions without compromising much of its qualities. Practical applications. Water chestnut possesses excellent therapeutic potential owing to the presence of bioactive compounds including glycosides, phytosterols, flavonoids, and tannins, which may help in alleviating various diseases. Besides, water chestnut has low glycemic index; thus, the developed products prepared from it may be suitable for diabetics. Extruded products have better consumer acceptability in terms of shelf life and organoleptic characteristics. Therefore, the extruded products developed from nutritionally rich water chestnut would be a better alternative to already available extruded snacks in food industry. It can open up a new horizon in the field of extrusion products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15569					FSTA:2021-11-Ge6028

Cham. & Schltdl. leaves: an underutilized wild vegetable.		Food Science & Nutrition					The nutritional and antinutrient composition of Heteromorpha arborescens (Spreng.) Cham. & Schltdl. Leaves was reported in this study. Proximate analysis revealed the presence of 8.5% total ash, 4.92% crude fat, 8.41% moisture, 15.74% crude protein, 21.48% crude fiber, 40.95% carbohydrates, and 271.04 kcal/100 g energy value. Mineral analysis showed that H. arborescens leaves are very rich in K, Ca, and Fe. Considerable amounts of Mg, Mn, Na, P, Cu, and Zn were also present. Vitamin analysis showed that the plant has a high content of vitamins A, C, and E. The antinutrients evaluated were phytate, oxalate, saponin, and alkaloids, all of which were below toxic levels except for saponin which was observed at moderately high level. The results credibly indicate that H. arborescens leaves are nutrient-rich and can contribute effectively to the daily nutrient requirements alongside its therapeutic properties. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Abiko, M.; Koda, T.; Nishioka, A.							Effect of conditions of shear and heat milling machine on structures and properties of rice batter.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					We investigated a method of baking bread from rice flour without the use of thickeners such as gluten or polysaccharides. Rice flours with different crystallinities were prepared by a shear and heat milling machine. The dynamic viscoelasticity of the resulting rice flour batters was measured and bread was baked from these batters. Models of rice flour batters were proposed based on their macroscopic appearances and mesoscopic polarized light microscopy images. It was shown that gelatinization due to swelling of crystalline flour contributes to the high expansion ratio of baking processability. By controlling the crystallinity of the rice flour by changing conditions of the milling process, the rheology of the rice flour batter can be adjusted to produce bread with a high expansion ratio without using a thickener. Practical applications. In this study, rice bread was made without the use of thickening agents such as gluten or polysaccharides. The batter, whose storage modulus increased rapidly during baking, showed a high expansion rate. This was caused by the swelling of crystalline starch granules in the rice batter. The practical application of this research is to make it possible to produce bread, noodles, and baked goods with form-controlled starch to exclude wheat from the system. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Ablay, O. D.; Ozdikicierler, O.; Gumuskesen, A. S.							Optimization of ultrasound-assisted alkali neutralization in the refining of safflower oil to minimize the loss of bioactive compounds.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					In this study, ultrasound-assisted (UA) neutralization parameters are optimized using the response surface methodology to develop a novel alkali neutralization method based on the minimal refining concept. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), magnesium oxide (MgO), and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) are used in both the traditional (TR) and UA neutralizations. Optimum probe depth, duration, and intensity levels are calculated as 3.7 cm, 25 s, and 54.3%, respectively, for UA neutralization with NaOH, which is more successful at free fatty acid (FFA) reduction and total phenolic content (TPC) retention than MgO and Ca (OH)2. Validation results of optimum conditions show that lowest average FFA content (0.29%) and highest average TPC (211.2 mg kg-1) are determined for the UA-neutralized safflower oil samples. The comparison of all the neutralization experiments reveal that the UA neutralization under optimum conditions using NaOH reduced 82.8% of the FFA content, whereas the TR alkali neutralization reduced the FFA content at a maximum of only 47.8%. Practical Applications. From the results, it can be inferred that the UA neutralization exhibits good performance in FFA content reduction and bioactive compound retention while offering a good solution within the concept of minimal refining. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Biodegradable films reinforced with bio-nanomaterials are a solution for developing active packaging systems, shelf-life extension and protection of environment against conventional packaging. This study aimed to characterize the biocompatible chitosan (CS) films formulated with nano-liposomal garlic essential oil (NLGEO) and assess the physicho-mechanical, morphology properties and also microbial and chemical changes in chicken fillets during storage time at 4 °C. NLGEO was obtained by thin-layer hydration-sonication method using glycerol and tween 80 as plasticizer and emulsifier, respectively. Different levels (0, 0.5,1 and 2%) of NLGEO with average size of ~101 nm were added into the chitosan matrix and films fabricated by casting method. The average size, polydispersity index and zeta potential were ~101 nm, 0.127 and -7.23, respectively. Control samples showed higher values for pH, total volatile nitrogen (TVN), peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), and microbial count including total viable count (TVC), coliforms, Staphylococcus aureus and psychrotroph bacteria than treated samples. The films with higher NLGEO content represented stronger inhibitory effects. The incorporation of NLGEO improved the mechanical properties and water resistance of active films. Microstructure analysis also showed a nearly smooth surface morphology and homogenous structure with a good dispersion for NLGEO films. Significant synergistic effects in chemical and bacterial preservation of chicken fillet samples were observed by NLGEO films. The optimal mechanical and barrier properties of chitosan-NLGEO films introduced it a potential active packaging to extend the shelf life of chicken fillet.

Journal of AOAC International					Background. Ocimumgenus, known as Tulsi or Basil, is a prominent botanical class in Asian culture, especially in India. The leaves have immunomodulatory, antioxidant, stress-relieving, and adaptogenic roles in traditional and modern medicine, with prominent usage in herbal teas and nutraceuticals. Objective. An high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array (HPLC-PDA) method was developed and validated for quantification of vicenin-2, orientin, cynaroside, betulinic acid, genistein with syringic acid, rosmarinic acid, eugenol, carnosic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, luteolin, and apigenin and was confirmed using a novel electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS) method in the Ocimumgenus samples. Method. The methodology parameters were developed on an reverse phase (RP) C18 column with a gradient elution of 1 mL/min flow rate for 0.1% o-phosphoric acid and acetonitrile at 210 and 340 nm wavelengths. Results. The validation data for 13 bioactive compounds showed good linearity (r2 > 0.99) with sensitive LOD (0.034-0.684 g/mL) and LOQ (0.100-2.068 g/mL) with recoveries (83.66-101.53%). The results of the quantification were found to be precise (RSD, <5.0%) and accurate (relative error (RE), -0.60-1.06). The method performance was verified by analyzing 10 samples of O. tenuiflorum from the 10 geographical states of India (RSD, <5.0%) and were found to be robust. This HPLC-PDA method with ESI-MS/MS confirmation was applicable to the 13 cultivars from O. thyrsiflorum, O. citriodorum, O. americanum, O. africanum, O. basilicum, O. gratissimum, and O. tenuiflorum species. Conclusions. The validated HPLC-PDA and LC-ESI-MS/MS method was found to be selective and suitable for analyzing 13 compounds in O. tenuiflorum and 12 cultivars from the Ocimum genus as a quality control tool. This method can be used in routine analysis as an inexpensive alternative to advanced techniques. Highlights. This work is the first to report for vicenin-2, orientin, cynaroside, betulinic acid, and genistein, with simultaneous analysis of eight bioactive compounds in the Ocimumgenus.										2021	104	6	1634	1651	1060-3271				10.1093/jaoacint/qsab067					FSTA:2022-08-Te3213

Processing methods affect phytochemical contents in products prepared from orange-fleshed sweetpotato leaves and roots.		Food Science & Nutrition					Phytochemicals enhance human health by acting antagonistically on incidences of cancer and other chronic diseases. They are considered indispensable in a variety of nutraceutical, pharmaceuticals, and medicinal and cosmetic applications. This study evaluated the effects of common processing methods on inherent phytochemical content in the roots and leaves of orange-fleshed sweetpotato (OFSP) varieties called Kabode and SPK031. Yellosp and Whitesp, which are local sweetpotato varieties, were also included as check for roots and leaves, respectively. The sweetpotato products prepared for phytochemical analysis were boiling roots and leaves, frying chips and crisps, baking bread (for roots only), and fermenting and dehydrating leaves. Phytochemicals that were assessed included vitamin C, total phenolics and flavonoids, tannins, phytates, and soluble oxalates. Results indicated that retention of vitamin C was highest in boiled roots (85%-95%), followed by fries (71%-94%) and crisps (44%-76%), whereas the least retention was in bread (4%-11%) and leaves (0%-27%). Total phenolics, flavonoids, and antioxidant activity in leaves significantly (p<.05) varied with the type of processing. Higher retention of these phytochemicals was observed in processed roots but was lowest in bread. Boiling retained more than 100% of all carotenoids, while fermenting and drying the leaves retained 58-62 and 22%-48%, respectively. Frying retained more than 100% of the beta-carotene in the roots, while boiling retained 96%-100%. All processing methods significantly (p<.05) reduced antinutrients in leaves and roots. Fermentation of leaves had higher reduction of oxalates, tannins, and phytates, while boiling had the least effect. It is concluded that traditional boiling enhances phytochemical retention in roots but degrades most of them in leaves. © 2020 The Authors.

Urinary excretion of 2/3-monochloropropanediol (2/3-MCPD) and 2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (DHPMA) after a single high dose of fatty acid esters of 2/3-MCPD and glycidol: a controlled exposure study in humans.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. 2-and 3-monochloropropanediol (2/3-MCPD) and glycidol are absorbed in the intestine after lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis of their fatty acid esters. Methods and results. In an exposure study with 12 non-smoking participants, the complete urinary excretion of the metabolite 2,3-dihydroxypropylmercapturic acid (DHPMA) and of 2/3-MCPD is measured on four consecutive days before and after consumption of 50 g glycidyl ester-rich palm fat or 12 g 2/3-MCPD ester-rich hazelnut oil. After controlled exposure, urinary excretion rates of 2/3-MCPD per hour strongly increase, followed by a decrease with average half-lives of 5.8 h (2-MCPD) and 3.6 h (3-MCPD). After consumption of hazelnut oil, mean excretion rates are 14.3% (2-MCPD) and 3.7% (3-MCPD) of the study doses. The latter rate is significantly higher (4.6%) after consumption of palm fat, indicating partial conversion (about 5%) of glycidol to 3-MCPD under the acidic conditions in the stomach. The average daily "background" exposure is estimated to be 0.12 and 0.32 g per kg body weight (BW) for 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD, respectively. The relatively high and constant urinary excretion of DHPMA does not reflect the controlled exposure. Conclusion. Urinary excretion of 2-and 3-MCPD is suitable as biomarker for the external exposure to the respective fatty acid esters. © 2021 The Authors.

International Journal of Food Properties					Weak market linkages, unavailability of cold-storage, and the significant loss of eggs due to breakage and low shelf-life contribute to the unaffordability and the low consumption of eggs in low-income countries like Ethiopia. The effect of spray-and oven-drying of eggs from local (Ethiopian) and exotic (imported) chicken breeds on physical, techno-functional, and nutritional composition of egg-powders were evaluated. Exotic (n=150) and local (n=140) eggs were spray/oven dried. The yield, bulk-density, flowability, and the foaming-, emulsification-, and water/oil absorption-capacity of the egg powders were assessed. The concentrations in energy, protein, fat, ash, and minerals were determined. The egg-powders' contribution to nutrient requirements for a child and their potential use as an alternative protein source in ready to use therapeutic foods (RUTF) were estimated. The low moisture (<5%) and water activity (aw~0.4-0.5) of the egg-powders implied unfavorable conditions for microbial growth. Local eggs had higher energy and fat content, whereas protein was higher in the exotic eggs (P< .05). About 12.5 g of egg powder (one egg) can fulfill >75%, 30%, and 40% of fat, energy, and calcium requirements for children 6-23 months of age, respectively. Only 6 g and 4 g of egg-powder are needed to fulfill protein and choline requirements, respectively. Considering the quality/quantity of proteins, egg powders can be alternative protein sources in RUTFs. The drying of local and exotic eggs with oven-and spray-drying yielded egg powders with acceptable techno-functional properties, but future studies should elucidate differences observed by egg type and drying; and investigate the shelf-life.

Assessment of sanitiser efficacy against Staphylococcus spp. isolated from Minas Frescal cheese producers in Sao Paulo, Brazil.		International Dairy Journal					This study evaluated bactericidal efficacy test of sanitisers for benzalkonium chloride, sodium hypochlorite and peracetic acid, determined minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of sanitisers and assessed their effect on the reduction of biofilms produced by Staphylococcus spp. strains isolated from organic and conventionally produced Minas Frescal cheese dairy products. The MIC was determined at three different contact times (5, 10, and 15 min). Biofilms formed on stainless steel and the efficiency of sanitisers in removing the biofilms were investigated at contact times of 5 and 10 min and incubated for 24 and 48 h. All strains tested were able to form biofilm within 24 and 48 h for all evaluated sanitisers, indicating the MIC used in this study was not sufficient to inactivate biofilm formation. Therefore, the MICs obtained through the analysis of the microorganism in its planktonic form were not efficient to eliminate the biofilms formed.

Bacterial diversity in organic and conventional Minas Frescal cheese production using targeted 16S rRNA sequencing.		International Dairy Journal					Molecular identification and the study of bacteria in processed food products can be challenging or suffer limitations when using conventional methods. However, with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), one can identify bacterial species with a significantly higher detection sensitivity using a 16S rRNA target gene. This study aimed to characterise the bacterial diversity of the organic and conventional production of Minas Frescal cheese, through the NGS analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. DNA was extracted from 96 samples, 48 from organic production and 48 from conventional production. The bacterial families and genera with the highest prevalence were identified. The most prevalent families were Enterobacteriaceae, Planococcaceae and Moraxellaceae. The NGS 16S rRNA tool proved to be very useful for bacterial characterisation, but it is still not possible to say whether a product contains more or less bacteria based on organic production, as there are several factors that contribute to contamination.

Antimicrobial resistance of Staphylococcus spp. isolated from organic and conventional Minas Frescal cheese producers in Sao Paulo, Brazil.		Journal of Dairy Science					The genus Staphylococcus is recognized worldwide as a cause of bacterial infections in humans and animals. Antibiotics used in dairy cattle combined with ineffective control can increase antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was to characterize 95 Staphylococcus strains isolated from organic and conventional Minas Frescal cheese production regarding antibiotic resistance (phenotype and genotype), presence of sanitizer-resistant genes and biofilm-formation genes, and SCCmec typing. Most strains (25.3%) showed higher resistance to penicillin, followed by oxacillin (21.1%) and clindamycin (11.6%). Among antibiotic resistance genes, the most prevalent were blaZ (25.3%), mecA (13.7%), lsaB (6.3%), msrA (4.2%), ant4 (3.2%), and tetM (2.1%); among sanitizer-resistance genes they were qacA/B (5.3%) and qacC (6.3%); and among biofilm, bap (4.2%), icaA (29.5%), icaD (41.1%). However, there was no statistically significant difference between organic and conventional dairy products, possibly due to the lack of synthetic antibiotic use on conventional farms during the sample collection period. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had their SCCmec identified as types I and IVc, and the methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci had nontypeable SCCmec. These results suggest that there are antibiotic-resistant strains in both organic and conventional Minas Frescal cheese production in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil. This supports the idea that improved quality control is needed from the milking stage up to the final product.

Naturally methylated mannogalactans from the edible mushrooms Pholiota nameko and Pleurotus eryngii.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This study reports the presence of mannogalactans in Pholiota nameko and Pleurotus eryngii edible mushrooms, with their purification and detailed structural characterization. Two mannogalactans (R30PN and E30PN) were reported in P. nameko, differing mainly in their Mw (37.9*104 g/mol and 2.4*104 g/mol). The mannogalactans presented a linear (16)-alpha-d-galactan in the main chain, and single branches at O-2 by beta-d-Man p as non-reducing end units. The main chain also contained naturally 3-O-methylated Gal p units, in amounts that varied from 15.2-23.7%. P. nameko mannogalactans were described for the first time. Heteropolysaccharides from mushrooms may display functional activities, like antitumor, anti-inflammatory and immunostimulatory which are related to their chemical structure. Thus, this study is of relevance since it unveils the structural details of two mannogalactans from P. nameko and one from P. eryngii mushrooms. Further studies are encouraged to verify how these structural differences may interfere in their biological activities.

Effect of canning method on the food security, physical-chemical characterization and sensorial analysis of banana tree palm heart.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Crop residues can be used in several ways, e.g processed and marketed for human consumption. The purpose of this paper is an initial approach to this few explored subject, testing two methodology of canning banana tree palm heart, treatment 1 (1% citric acid and 5% sodium chloride at the waiting liquid) and treatment 2 (200 ppm sodium bisulfite at the waiting liquid), their physical-chemical characterization and food security over time, besides sensorial analysis. Both treatments showed good values of phenolic compounds (22.56 and 14.99 mg GAE/100 g respectively) and fibers (2.96 and 2.69 g/100 g), the pH stability (below 4.5) over time and the HCN absence guarantee food security, in the acceptance and purchase intention test, obtained slightly good grades. This product is viable from a nutritional point of view, safe, promising about the palate, opening the field for further studies, in order to improve the methodology to achieve better results. Novelty impact statement. This is a very complete study, covering from the physico-chemical characterization of this banana crop waste, to food security and consumer acceptance. In this context, this experiment was carried out in order to evaluate two waiting liquids, one homemade and the other with preservative commonly used in the food industry. Both treatments showed good values of phenolic compounds and fibers, associated to many health benefits. PH stability over time, before the microorganisms identified in the microbiological analyzes, and the absence of HCN guarantee food security. In the acceptance and purchase intention test, the banana tree palm heart obtained slightly good grades. Given the need to produce more food, especially in poorer regions, prove that a cultural waste, commonly discarded, can be used as a low-cost food source is very important. In addition, it provides extra income to banana producers, given that most of them are small producers. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15758					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0160

Proteomic characterization of bacteriophage peptides from the mastitis producer Staphylococcus aureus by LC-ESI-MS/MS and the bacteriophage phylogenomic analysis.		Foods					The present work describes LC-ESI-MS/MS MS (liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry) analyses of tryptic digestion peptides from phages that infect mastitis-causing Staphylococcus aureus isolated from dairy products. A total of 1933 nonredundant peptides belonging to 1282 proteins were identified and analyzed. Among them, 79 staphylococcal peptides from phages were confirmed. These peptides belong to proteins such as phage repressors, structural phage proteins, uncharacterized phage proteins and complement inhibitors. Moreover, eighteen of the phage origin peptides found were specific to S. aureus strains. These diagnostic peptides could be useful for the identification and characterization of S. aureus strains that cause mastitis. Furthermore, a study of bacteriophage phylogeny and the relationship among the identified phage peptides and the bacteria they infect was also performed. The results show the specific peptides that are present in closely related phages and the existing links between bacteriophage phylogeny and the respective Staphylococcus spp. Infected. © 2021 by the authors.

Degen; Nurshad Ali							The presence of aflatoxin M1 in milk and milk products in Bangladesh.		Toxins					As milk provides both micro-and macronutrients, it is an important component in the diet. However, the presence of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) in the feed of dairy cattle results in contamination of milk and dairy products with aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), a toxic metabolite of the carcinogenic mycotoxin. With the aim to determine AFM1 concentrations in milk and milk products consumed in Bangladesh, in total, 145 samples were collected in four divisional regions (Sylhet, Dhaka, Chittagong, and Rajshahi). The samples comprised these categories: raw milk (n=105), pasteurized milk (n=15), ultra-high temperature (UHT)-treated milk (n=15), fermented milk products such as yogurt (n=5), and milk powder (n=5). AFM1 levels in these samples were determined through competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, AFM1 was present in 78.6% of milk and milk products in the range of 5.0 to 198.7 ng/L. AFM1 was detected in 71.4% of raw milk (mean 41.1, range 5.0-198.7 ng/L), and in all pasteurized milk (mean 106, range 17.2-187.7 ng/L) and UHT milk (mean 73, range 12.2-146.9 ng/L) samples. Lower AFM1 levels were found in yogurt (mean 16.9, range 8.3-41.1 ng/L) and milk powder samples (mean 6.6, range 5.9-7.0 ng/L). About one-third of the raw, pasteurized, and UHT milk samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit (50 ng/L) for AFM1 in milk, while AFM1 levels in yogurt and milk powder samples were well below this limit. Regarding regions, lower AFM1 contamination was observed in Chittagong (mean 6.6, max 10.6 ng/L), compared to Sylhet (mean 53.7, max 198.7 ng/L), Dhaka (mean 37.8, max 97.2 ng/L), and Rajshahi (mean 34.8, max 131.4 ng/L). Yet, no significant difference was observed in AFM1 levels between summer and winter season. In conclusion, the observed frequency and levels of aflatoxin contamination raise concern and must encourage further monitoring of AFM1 in milk and milk products in Bangladesh. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Abu Zarim, N.; Zainul Abidin, S.; Fazilah Ariffin							Shelf life stability and quality study of texture-modified chicken rendang using xanthan gum as thickener for the consumption of the elderly with dysphagia.		Food Bioscience					A ready-to-eat food called texture-modified chicken rendang (TMCR) was developed for consumption of the elderly with dysphagia in Malaysia. Incorporation of xanthan gum as food thickener in retorted TMCR was evaluated monthly over 6 months' period for its shelf-life stability and quality. Throughout storage period, both stability and quality of the TMCR samples had reduced significantly, mainly due to lipid and protein oxidation. However, the absence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as yeast and mould count indicates that TMCR was safe to be consumed. In addition, the TBARs value was found to be within the acceptable limit (under 1.5 mg MDA/kg) indicating low level of rancidity. Overall, the addition of xanthan gum was able to reduce physical and chemical changes imparted from thermal and oxidation processes which affect both quality and stability of the stored samples.

Whole body metabolism is improved by hemin added to high fat diet while counteracted by nitrite: a mouse model of processed meat consumption.		Food & Function					Nitrites and nitrates are traditional food additives used as curing agents in the food industry. They inhibit the growth of microorganisms and give a typical pink color to meat. Besides the positive effects of nitrite in foods, if present at high levels in the body, may induce hypoxia and contribute to the production of pro-carcinogenic secondary N-nitrosamines. This study investigated the whole-body metabolic effects of hemin and nitrite added to a high fat diet as red and processed red meat nutritional models. Mice were fed for 11 weeks with five different diets-(1) control diet (ND), (2) high fat diet (HFD) with 60% fat, (3) HFD with hemin (HFD + H, red meat model), (4) HFD with hemin and nitrite (HFD + HN, processed meat model), and (5) HFD with hemin, nitrite, and secondary amine (HFD + HNN, N-nitrosamine generating model)-and several metabolic parameters were determined and respiratory measurements were performed. Mice fed with the HFD + H or HFD + HNN diet had a lower epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT): body ratio and lower fasting glucose level than those fed the HFD alone. In addition, our results demonstrated a relief in hepatosteatosis grade among the HFD + H and HFD + HNN diet fed mice. Nitrite added to the HFD impaired the ability to use fat for energy, opposite to the effect of hemin. This study shows that nitrite in addition to pro-carcinogenesis and hypoxia can impact metabolic disease progression when added to meat. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Food & Function					5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) is a chemotherapeutic drug with a good anti-cancer effect on various types of cancers, such as colorectal cancer and breast cancer. However, previous studies have found that 5-FU could induce cognitive deficit in clinics. As ganoderic acid, isolated from Ganoderma lucidum, has a protective effect on neurons, this study investigated the effects of ganoderic acid (GA) against 5-FU-induced cognitive dysfunction with a series of behavioral tests and related indicators. Experimental results showed that GA significantly prevented the reduction of spatial and non-spatial memory in 5-FU-treated mice. In addition, GA not only ameliorated the damage to hippocampal neurons and mitochondrial structure, but also significantly improved abnormal protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis related marker PGC-1alpha, and mitochondrial dynamics related markers MFN2, DRP1 and FIS1 in the hippocampi of 5-FU-treated mice. Moreover, GA could up-regulate the expression of neuronal survival and growth-related proteins, such as BDNF, p-ERK, p-CREB, p-Akt, p-GSK3beta, Nrf2, p-mTOR, and p-S6, in the hippocampi of 5-FU-treated mice. These results suggest that GA could prevent cognitive dysfunction in mice treated with 5-FU via preventing mitochondrial impairment and enhancing neuronal survival and growth, which provide evidence for GA as a promising adjunctive therapy for chemotherapy related cognitive impairment in clinics. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	24	12325	12337	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo03055h					FSTA:2022-04-Jq4504

Physicochemical properties of chocolate spread with hazelnut cake: comparative study and optimization.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of hazelnut cake as a partial replacer for sugar, milk and whey powders on the chocolate spread. A D-optimal mixture design was used to determine the effect of different mixtures of sugar, total milk originated powders (MOP), as milk powder and whey powder, and hazelnut cake (HC) on the physicochemical properties, as well as in vitro digestion of total phenolic compound before and after digestion and its bioaccessibility. Results were described by appropriate mathematical models defined by using best-fitting analysis. According to the results, the fitted models illustrated a desirable coefficient of determination (≥81%). The optimization of the variables indicated that using 43.562% sugar, 7.186% MOP and 7.252% HC produced the optimum chocolate spread with the highest desirability (1.00) without unwanted variations in the quality properties. The HC as an industrial by-product could be used in chocolate spread to increase bioactive compounds and also to decrease product costs by decreasing the sugar, milk and whey powder of the final product.

Effect of grape pomace usage in chocolate spread formulation on textural, rheological and digestibility properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, dried grape (Cabernet sauvignon) pomace (DGP) as a by-product of wine production was used in the chocolate spread (CS) instead of various amounts of sugar and milk originated powders (MOP; skimmed milk and demineralized whey powder 1:1, w/w). The formulations of CS samples were determined using mixture design method. The sugar, MOP and DGP concentrations changed between 35 and 50, 0.066-8.000 and 0.23-15 g/100 g, respectively. According to the results, the consistency coefficient (K) and flow behavior index values of CS samples changed between 8.10 and 28.50 Pa.sn and 0.52-0.71, respectively. In addition, firmness and spreadability parameters were determined between 0.80-1.42 N and 2.15-4.24 N mm, respectively. Total phenolic content in CS samples ranged from 3415 to 13,754 mg GAE/kg and their digestibility ranged between 25% and 84%. Also, the digestibility of resveratrol was determined between 47.6% and 95.7% at different DGP concentrations. All of the established models successfully described the relation with R2 values higher than 0.800. Textural and rheological parameters as well as sensory characteristics of the samples indicated that DGP may be used as a healthy and low-cost ingredient in CS formulation to partially substitute sugar and MOP.

The phenolic profile and biological activities of the wild-edible mushrooms Helvella leucopus and Morchella pulchella.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Morchella pulchella Clowez & Franc. Petit. and Helvella leucopus pers. Are among the most utilized naturally grown wild-edible mushroom species in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. This study focused on revealing their phenolic profiles using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS), antioxidant (hydrogen atom and single electron-transfer mechanisms), and enzyme inhibition (acetylcholinesterase, amylase, glucosidase, and lipase) activities of lyophilized sequential (n-hexane, ethanol, methanol, and water, respectively) extracts and traditional preparations (infusion and decoction) obtained from the fruiting bodies of these mycomaterials. Our chromatographic studies revealed that M. pulchella extracts are dominated by caffeic acid, while H. leucopus extracts contained significant levels of protocatechuic acid as a major biologically active compound (excluding n-hexane fractions). The most active antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory extracts were from ethanol (or methanol) in M. pulchella and water (or infusion) in H. leucopus. Data obtained from our study showed that hydrophilic extracts of M. pulchella and H. leucopus were significant sources of antioxidants and enzyme inhibition activities and that they might be used as raw materials in the food, nutraceutical, biotherapeutic and pharmaceutical industries. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	555	566	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00654-3					FSTA:2021-06-Jq7246
J		Acevedo-fani, A.; Ochoa-grimaldo, A.; Loveday, S. M.; Harjinder Singh							Digestive dynamics of yoghurt structure impacting the release and bioaccessibility of the flavonoid rutin.		Food Hydrocolloids					Rutin is a dietary flavonoid and a potent antioxidant with clinically relevant functions. Hence, rutin-enriched food products can be used as functional foods. However, rutin has low bioavailability because of its low water solubility, poor stability and limited membrane permeability. We previously reported a casein-rutin co-precipitate that significantly increased water solubility, compared with commercially available rutin powders. This work investigated the gastrointestinal behaviour of a yoghurt enriched with casein-rutin co-precipitate (RuYO) and an unfortified yoghurt combined with powdered rutin in a vegetable-based capsule (CtYO+ Ru). A semi-dynamic in vitro digestion protocol was followed; the gastric phase was simulated in a human gastric simulator. The physical properties and rutin content of digesta samples were determined at different digestion times. The solids retention of RuYO and CtYO+ Ru in the gastric phase decreased with increasing digestion time, confirming that gastric emptying occurred at a constant rate. Confocal microscopy indicated that the protein network was increasingly hydrolysed during gastric digestion. The release and stability of rutin during the digestion of RuYO were dramatically different from those of CtYO+ Ru. Although a significant amount of the flavonoid remained in the insoluble fraction during gastric digestion, it was more stable in RuYO than in CtYO+ Ru (total cumulative recoveries of 98% and 61% respectively). Similarly, rutin degradation was lower in RuYO in the intestinal phase (total cumulative recovery: RuYO, 26%; CtYO+ Ru, 17%). Overall, yoghurt fortified with rutin-casein co-precipitate gives better in vitro rutin bioaccessibility than the same yoghurt co-digested with a rutin supplement capsule.

J		Acevedo-Martinez, K. A.; Mejia, E. G. de							Fortification of maize tortilla with an optimized chickpea hydrolysate and its effect on DPPIV inhibition capacity and physicochemical characteristics.		Foods					Chickpea hydrolysates have shown bioactivity towards type 2 diabetes by inhibiting dipeptidyl peptidase (DPPIV) activity. The objective was to compare the effect of adding different levels of an optimized bromelain hydrolysate from chickpea isolated protein on DPPIV inhibition capacity and physicochemical properties of maize tortilla. White and blue maize tortillas, with no added chickpea hydrolysates were compared with fortified tortillas at the levels of 5%, 10%, and 15% w/w. Changes in color (L* a* b*, hue angle, and DeltaE), texture (hardness, cohesiveness, and puncture force), and moisture were tested. Soluble protein determination and SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were used to characterize the protein profiles, and LC-MS-MS was used to sequence the peptides. DPPIV inhibition was evaluated before and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. Peptides in the hydrolysates had high hydrophobicity (7.97-27.05 kcal * mol-1) and pI (5.18-11.13). Molecular docking of peptides showed interaction with DPPIV with an energy of affinity of -5.8 kcal/mol for FDLPAL in comparison with vildagliptin (-6.2 kcal/mol). The lowest fortification level increased soluble protein in 105% (8 g/100 g tortilla). DPPIV inhibition of white maize tortilla increased from 11% (fresh control) to 91% (15% fortification), and for blue tortilla from 26% to 95%. After simulated digestion, there was not a difference between blue or maize tortillas for DPPIV inhibition. Fortification of maize tortilla with chickpea hydrolysate inhibits DPPIV and can potentially be used in the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. However, due to observed physicochemical changes of the fortified tortilla, sensory properties and consumer acceptance need to be evaluated. © 2021 by the authors.

Drying behaviour was evaluated using ten drying kinetic models and hyperspectral imaging. All samples reached water activity values (Aw) < 0.85 during the first 90 min of drying. Moisture content (MC) of beef jerky was predicted using near infrared hyperspectral imaging and chemometrics. Partial least squares regression, band selection and spectral pre-treatments were applied to develop MC prediction models using beef jerky spectra. Most of the MC prediction models developed in this work had RPD values >4, indicating their suitability for process control applications. The best performing MC prediction models for the non-ultrasound and ultrasound treated samples were developed using the ensemble Monte Carlo variable selection (EMCVS) on second derivative of log (1/R) spectra and EMCVS-selectivity ratio on linear detrended log (1/R) spectra, respectively. This study demonstrated the potential of NIR-HSI and chemometrics as a PAT tool for drying of beef jerky. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Sensitization potency of sunflower seed protein in a mouse model: identification of 2S-albumins more allergenic than SFA-8.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Food allergy to sunflower seed (SFS) protein is not frequent and only non-specific lipid transfert protein (nsLTP) Hel a 3 is officially recognized as a food allergen. Out of the eleven seed storage 2S-albumins (SESA) detected in SFS, only SFA-8 allergenicity has been investigated so far. The study aimed then to evaluate SFS protein allergenicity and particularly, to compare the sensitization potency of SESA in a mouse model. Methods and Results. The most abundant SESA and nsLTP were isolated from SFS through a combination of chromatographic methods. Purified proteins were then used to measure specific IgG1 and IgE responses in BALB/c mice orally sensitized to different SFS protein isolates. The study, thus, confirmed the allergenicity of SFA-8 and Hel a 3 but mice were also highly sensitized to other SESA such as SESA2-1 or SESA20-2. Furthermore, competitive inhibition of IgE-binding revealed that SFA-8 IgE-reactivity was due to cross-reactivity with other SESA. 11S-globulins were weakly immunogenic and were rapidly degraded in an in vitro model of gastroduodenal digestion. In contrast, Hel a 3, SESA2-1 and SFA-8 were more resistant to proteolysis and gastroduodenal digestion did not affect their IgE-reactivity. Conclusions. SESA2-1 or SESA20-2 were more potent allergens than SFA-8 in this mouse model. Allergenicity of SESA must be now confirmed in SFS-allergic patients. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Research International					Rosmarinus officinalis L. Is a widespread aromatic plant commonly consumed as a tea in traditional cuisine and in folk medicine to treat various illnesses due to its therapeutic properties. To the best of our knowledge, there are no reports on the bioavailability and metabolism of R. officinalis tea polyphenols in humans. This study was aimed at assessing the bioavailability and nutrikinetics of R. officinalis phenolic compounds in healthy humans for the first time. Forty-eight compounds were identified in plasma and urine. Few un-metabolized compounds were detected since rosemary polyphenols were extensively metabolized into phase II conjugates, with rapid appearance and clearance in plasma, pointing to small intestinal absorption. Phase II derivatives of caffeic acid showed kinetics compatible with both intestinal and colonic hydrolysis of rosmarinic acid yielding free caffeic and 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl-lactic acids, which were absorbed and metabolized into phase II derivatives. These metabolites, along with reduced forms of caffeic acid and their phase II metabolites, and those of hydroxyphenylpropionic, hydroxylphenylacetic, benzoic and hippuric acids, highlight the importance of colonic absorption. Total urinary excretion of the phenols added up to 235 mol, corresponding to 22.3% of the ingested amount (1055 M). In conclusion, rosemary tea polyphenols are partially bioavailable and extensively metabolized, mainly by the colonic microbiota. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Acin-Albiac, M.; Filannino, P.; Arora, K.; Ros, A. da; Gobbetti, M.; Cagno, R. di							Role of lactic acid bacteria phospho-beta-glucosidases during the fermentation of cereal by-products.		Foods					Bioprocessing using lactic acid bacteria (LAB) is a powerful means to exploit plant-derived by-products as a food ingredient. LAB have the capability to metabolize a large variety of carbohydrates, but such metabolism only relies on few metabolic routes, conferring on them a high fermentation potential. One example of these pathways is that involving phospho-beta-glucosidase genes, which are present in high redundancy within LAB genomes. This enzymatic activity undertakes an ambivalent role during fermentation of plant-based foods related to the release of a wide range of phenolic compounds, from their beta-D-glycosylated precursors and the degradation of beta-glucopyranosyl derived carbohydrates. We proposed a novel phenomic approach to characterize the metabolism drift of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides caused by a lignocellulosic by-product, such as the brewers' spent grain (BSG), in contrast to Rich De Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) broth. We observed an increased metabolic activity for gentiobiose, cellobiose and beta-glucoside conjugates of phenolic compounds during BSG fermentation. Gene expression analysis confirmed the importance of cellobiose metabolism while a release of lignin-derived aglycones was found during BSG fermentation. We provided a comprehensive view of the important role exerted by LAB 6-phospho-beta-glucosidases as well the major metabolic routes undertaken during plant-based fermentations. Further challenges will consider a controlled characterization of pbg gene expression correlated to the metabolism of beta-glucosides with different aglycone moieties. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Washing, which is the first step in both household and industrial scale food processing, contributes to the reduction of pesticide residues over the surface of fruits. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the effectiveness of different type of non-toxic washing agents (tap water and different concentrations of sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, acetic acid, apple cider and grape vinegar solutions) on residues of abamectin, buprofezin, imazalil, thiophanate-methyl in orange. The residue of pesticides were determined by QuEChERS extraction followed by liquid chromatography equipped with triple quadrupole mass spectrophotometer (LC-MS-MS). The results prevailed that pesticide residue levels decreased gradually during washing steps with processing factors <1. Maximum and minimum reduction ratio was obtained for thiophanate-methyl and abamectin as 84% and 2%, respectively. The reductions in residue levels were mainly related with the octanol-water partition coefficient in addition to type and concentration of the solutions. Effectiveness order of the treatments was the alkaline solutions (10% sodium carbonate) > acidic solutions (%8 acetic acid) > vinegar solutions neutral solutions (10% sodium chloride) > tap water. In practical applications, household solutions easily found at home preferably sodium carbonate may be used along with tap water to decrease pesticide residues in fresh produce.

Effect of a cryogenic treatment in the microstructure, functional and flow properties of soy protein isolate.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this work, the impact of cryogenic treatment of soy protein isolate (SPI) on its microstructure, functional and flow properties was evaluated. SPI was treated with 96% ethanol, freezed in liquid nitrogen, and then lyophilized to obtain the modified soy protein isolate (MSPI). To analyze the changes in the surfaces of the SPI and MSPI particles, AFM images were taken. An adsorption isotherm was performed at 25 °C, then the surface fractal dimension and specific surface area were analyzed by water adsorption isotherm at 25 °C. Functional properties such as emulsion capacity, foam, oil and water absorption, gelling and viscosity were determined. Likewise, the flow properties of powders as bulk density, tapped density, particle density, Hausner index, compressibility index and porosity were determined. MSPI showed hollows in the surface, higher roughness (Rq) and higher specific surface area than SPI. Regarding functional properties, MSPI presented higher viscosity, oil and water absorption, emulsifying and gelling capacity than SPI. MSPI powders showed lees flowability than SPI. The results suggested that the application of a cryogenic treatment in SPI changes the microstructure and impacts on the functional and flow properties of SPI, since some functional properties were improved, such as gelation, viscosity, emulsifying, adsorption and absorption capacity; and the flow properties were modified.

Effect of age of Agave tequilana weber blue variety on quality and authenticity parameters for the tequila 100% agave silver class: evaluation at the industrial scale level.		Foods					Due to the oversupply and scarcity cycles of the Agave tequilana Weber blue variety, the effect of agave age (harvested in 4, 5, and 6 years) as raw material for the tequila 100% agave silver class was studied for each stage in a full-scale (industrial) process. Harvested plants showed differences in their morphological characteristics that affected the amount of juice; this had an impact in the fermentation stage since must composition was modified in the nitrogen content and juice/exudate ratio. This was noticed due to an increase in the production of higher alcohols attributed to the odd-chain fatty of the exudate, which affects n-propanol production. The characterization of the final product showed the feasibility to use agaves (less than 7 years) to produce the Tequila 100% agave silver class and to comply with the quality criteria. Furthermore, the final product was analyzed with the gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass-spectrometry technique to determine its authenticity. The delta13CVPDB isotopic parameter (-13.40 pemille in average) values show the type of plant used as a raw material for ethanol production, while the delta18OVSMOW (20.52 pemille in average) isotopic parameter can be helpful in corroborating and ensuring the traceability of the product and the geographical location of the beverage production. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Acuna-Gutierrez, C.; Schock, S.; Jimenez, V. M.; Muller, J.							Detecting fumonisin B1 in black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).		Food Control					Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites produced by filamentous fungi that can affect both human and animal health. Because of this, their detection is of vital importance to avoid their consumption. To reduce time and costs, alternatives to laborious conventional laboratory tests are sought. However, these efforts have been made mainly for cereals, where near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) techniques have been studied. Little importance has been given to other groups, such as pulses, to which beans belong, to develop rapid detection techniques. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the feasibility of detecting fumonisin B1 (FB1) in beans using NIRS. To achieve this, controlled contamination with standard solutions of the mycotoxin (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg-1) was conducted using two application methods (spread and submersion, n=18 for each method). Subsequently, bulk samples composed of 24 individually contaminated beans, both milled or whole, were analyzed in the spectrometer, in the wavelength range of 680-2,500 nm. A better linear adjustment was obtained with the spread contamination method (R2=0.99). Moreover, different calibration models were applied using both types of contamination methods and sample types (milled or whole), by a partial least square regression (PLSR). The best result was obtained using the spread contamination method and grinding the sample (R2=0.92 and RMSE=0.77). The regression coefficients of this model show that the wavelengths 1,273, 1,282, 1,374, and 1,870 nm have a great influence on the variability of the model, which could be associated to changes due to the presence of FB1.

J		Adamcova, A.; Laursen, K. H.; Ballin, N. Z.							Lectin activity in commonly consumed plant-based foods: calling for method harmonization and risk assessment.		Foods					Lectins are ubiquitous proteins characterized through their ability to bind different types of carbohydrates. It is well known that active lectins from insufficiently prepared legumes can cause adverse human health effects. The objective of this study was to determine the activity of lectins in samples across plant families representing commercially available edible plants, and the feasibility of inactivating lectins through soaking and boiling. Lectins were extracted from the plant families Adoxaceae, Amaranthaceae, Cannabaceae, Fabaceae, Gramineae, Lamiaceae, Linaceae, Pedaliaceae, and Solanaceae. A hemagglutination assay based on non-treated or trypsin treated rabbit erythrocytes was used to measure the lectin activity. The results showed the highest lectin activity in species from the Fabaceae family and demonstrated that soaking and boiling have an effect on the levels of active lectins. This is the first large study that combines lectin activity obtained from two different assays with raw and processed edible plants. In addition, we examined the current risk assessment, and regulations necessary for an adequate official reporting of results. We encourage the scientific community to further explore this field and agree on harmonized methods for analysis and interpretation, and hope that our methodology can initiate this development. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Adamczyk, D.; Maison, D.							Ecology or health-how to successfully promote palm oil free products: a comparison between Spain and Poland.		Foods					Palm oil, widely used in the food industry, is causing some concern due to its negative impact on the environment and human health. The goal of the conducted research was to answer the question of what would be a better strategy for the marketing communication of palm oil substitutes, its health benefits or its environmental friendliness? This article presents a research project exploring the potential of chocolate bread spread based on a saturated fat and palm oil substitute. The research was conducted on two samples of Spanish (n=675) and Polish (n=661) bread spread consumers. In the experimental study, consumers were presented with a description of a new chocolate spread entering the market, with references to (a) its health benefits or (b) its environmental benefits resulting from the absence of palm oil in the product. The results showed that ecology references in food-related marketing communication in Spain have a stronger influence on the consumer decision-making process than health references. In Poland, the effect of communication was moderated by an evaluation of a person's eating style and the individual level of eco-friendly behavior of the consumer. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Adamczyk, G.; Ivanisova, E.; Kaszuba, J.; Bobel, I.; Khvostenko, K.; Chmiel, M.; Falendysh, N.							Quality assessment of wheat bread incorporating chia seeds.		Foods					The aim of this study was to develop a concept of production for wheat bread enriched with chia seeds and to examine selected physicochemical properties. The examined product was wheat-flour bread made by a single-phase method, using yeast. The production concept assumed the modification of the recipe by replacing part of the wheat flour (1 or 5% w/w) with whole (CHw) or ground chia seeds (CHg). Bread quality was determined by calculating: dough yield, bread yield, baking loss, total baking loss and loaf volumes. Color was determined using the CIE L*a*b* system. In the texture analysis, the following texture parameters were measured: hardness, cohesion, chewiness and elasticity. The contents of crude fat, crude fiber, total protein, total ash and the total content of polyphenols were assessed to characterize the nutritive value of the bread. The breads with 1% addition of chia (1%CHw, 1%CHg) were characterized by the highest volume of loaves, which increased by at least 8.6% compared to the control bread (C), while in the case of 5% chia, the loaf volume depended on the form of seeds (better results were obtained with whole seeds). Substituting wheat flour with 1% chia seeds (whole or ground) resulted in a significant increase in nutritional value. For potential bread manufacturers, from a technological and economic point of view, replacing wheat flour with whole chia seeds at 1% (w/w) is most advantageous, compared to 5% (w/w). © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of the study was to reduce the concentration of biogenic amines (BAs) in Dutch-type cheese by the activity of the added culture. The reduction of BAs was caused by the use of the selected strains of Lacticaseibacillus casei and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum over a three-month period (at 121°C). The results indicated that the use of different microbiological strains does not have a significant influence on the basic chemical parameters of the model cheese samples. The lowest BA concentrations were determined in model cheese with Lacticaseibacillus casei CCDM 198. These samples contained fewer total BA content than the control samples: after 28 days of ripening by 32%, after 56 days by 37% and after 84 days by 32%. The adjunct culture demonstrated high efficacy of reduction of putrescine, phenylethylamine and tyramine in real conditions of the model Dutch-type cheese samples.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The contamination of feeds and foods with mycotoxins is a serious problem worldwide. Deoxynivalenol (DON), an important mycotoxin from the trichothecene family, is abundant in animal feed. Mycotoxin binders such as Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) detoxify mycotoxins by adsorption and inactivate the toxins through the formation of mycotoxin-organic adsorbent complex or act as biomarkers to convert the toxins into less toxic products. In this study, the effect of organic adsorbent containing Lactobacillus strains and the cell wall of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was investigated on the reduction of DON. Various parameters including toxin concentration, adsorbent type, incubation time, and the synergism effect were also studied. The detoxification ability was demonstrated in all strains but the combination of Lactobacillus brevis TD4 and Lactobacillus paracasei TD3 in PBS solution and L. brevis TD4 and L. brevis TD10 in MRS broth medium showed the highest reduction rate of DON. Novelty Impact Statement. Deoxynivalenol causes devastating effects on animal health as well as agricultural products such as decreased milk yield and lower quality of dairy products. In the current study, the detoxification ability of mycotoxin-organic binders including Lactobacillus and yeast cell wall was investigated and the combination of Lactobacillus brevis TD4 and Lactobacillus paracasei TD3 in PBS solution and L. brevis TD4 and L. brevis TD10 in MRS broth medium showed the highest reduction rate of DON. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15212					FSTA:2021-07-Cd1956

Assessment of the optimum linker tethering site of alternariol haptens for antibody generation and immunoassay development.		Toxins					Immunochemical methods for mycotoxin analysis require antigens with well-defined structures and antibodies with outstanding binding properties. Immunoreagents for the mycotoxins alternariol and/or alternariol monomethyl ether have typically been obtained with chemically uncharacterized haptens, and antigen conjugates have most likely been prepared with mixtures of functionalized molecules. For the first time, total synthesis was performed, in the present study, to obtain two haptens with opposite linker attachment locations. The functionalized synthetic haptens were purified and deeply characterized by different spectrometric methods, allowing the preparation of bioconjugates with unequivocal structures. Direct and indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, using homologous and heterologous conjugates, were employed to extensively evaluate the generated immunoreagents. Antibodies with high affinity were raised from conjugates of both haptens, and a structure-activity relationship between the synthetic haptens and the specificity of the generated antibodies could be established. These results pave the way for the development of novel highly sensitive immunoassays selective of one or two of these Alternaria mycotoxins. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Addi, A.; Bareke, T.							Botanical origin and characterization of monofloral honeys in Southwestern forest of Ethiopia.		Food Science & Nutrition					The study was conducted to identify and characterize the monofloral honey types found in the Gesha-Sayilem forest. A total of 15 honey samples were collected during the honey flow seasons. For honey pollen analysis, the method recommended by the International Commission for Bee Botany and harmonized methods of the International Honey commission were used. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA, PCA, and Pearson correlation coefficients. Three monofloral honey types were identified, such as Schefflera abyssinica honey, Croton macrostachyus honey, and Vernonia amygdalina honey types. The mean moisture content of the honey samples of Vernonia amygdalina honey was 18.31.02%, that for Schefflera abyssinica honey 18.11%, and 21.21.05% for Croton macrostachyus honey. The HMF value of the Vernonia honey ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 mg/kg, with a mean value of 1.20.1 mg/kg; that of Schefflera abyssinica honey ranged from 2.2 to 2.5, with a mean value of HMF 2.30.15; and that of Croton honey ranged from 2.4 to 2.6 mg/kg, mean value of 2.560.15 mg/kg. There was a significant difference in the free acid content of honey samples due to the botanical origin of honey and sampling locations (p<.05). The electrical conductivity of honey samples in the Gesha-Sayilem forest was found within an international range, with a maximum limit of 0.8 mS/cm for most nectar honey. There was a significant strong correlation between proline, free acid, and sucrose. Moisture content was positively correlated with electric conductivity, due to the dependable nature of electrical conductivity on honey moisture. The study area honey meets the basic honey quality standards both of the national and international honey quality specifications, except that the moisture content of croton honey which was some what out of the accepted range. © 2021 Oromia Agricultural Research Institute.

Effect of dietary inclusion of almond fruit on sexual behavior, arginase activity, pro-inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in diabetic male rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study was designed to examine the effect of almond-included diets on sexual behavior, arginase activity, and pro-inflammatory markers in diabetic male rats. Forty-two male rats were divided into seven groups (n= 6). Diabetes was triggered via a single dose intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Diabetes was confirmed 72 hr after STZ induction, and animals with blood glucose ≥ 250 mg/dl were considered diabetic and used for the experiment. The effects of almond-supplemented diets on glucose level, sexual function, NF-kappaB and TNF-alpha levels, arginase and purinergic enzyme activities, and levels of oxidative stress markers were assessed. A significant decrease in sexual activities with a simultaneous increase in pro-inflammatory markers, arginase and purinergic enzyme activities as well as TBARS and ROS levels was observed in diabetic rats. Interestingly, treatment with supplemented diets ameliorated the effects. Conclusively, intake of almonds could prevent the risk of erectile dysfunction in diabetic subjects. Practical applications. Intake of diets rich in fruits, nuts, and vegetables has been reported to reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigate the effect of dietary inclusion of almond fruit on sexual behavior, arginase activity, oxidative stress, and pro-inflammatory markers in diabetic male rats. Interestingly, data generated from this work reveal that the supplemented diets enhanced sexual activities, and reduced oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory markers in diabetic male rats. Thus, consumption of almond (drupe and seed) could prevent/reduce the erectile dysfunction in individual with diabetes. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Safety of vitamin D food fortification and supplementation: evidence from randomized controlled trials and observational studies.		Foods					The safety considerations of food-based solutions for vitamin D deficiency prevention, such as fortification and supplementation, are critical. On the basis of collective data from 20 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 20 national healthy surveys, as well as prospective cohort studies (PCSs) across the ODIN project ("Food-based solutions for optimal vitamin D nutrition and health through the life cycle", FP7-613977), we analyzed the potential safety issues arising from vitamin D intakes and/or supplementation. These adverse consequences included high serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (S-25(OH)D) concentrations (>125 nmol/L), high serum calcium concentrations, and vitamin D intakes in excess of the tolerable upper intake levels (ULs). In the RCTs (n = 3353, with vitamin D doses from 5-175 g/day), there were no reported adverse effects. The prevalence of high S-25(OH)D was <10% when vitamin D supplements were administered, and <0.1% for fortified foods. Elevated serum calcium was observed among <0.5% in both administration types. No ODIN RCT participants exceeded the age-specific ULs. In observational studies (n = 61,082), the prevalence of high 25(OH)D among children/adolescents, adults, and older adults was <0.3%, with no evidence of adverse effects. In conclusion, high S-25(OH)D concentrations >125 nmol/L were rare in the RCTs and PCSs, and no associated adverse effects were observed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Comparative evaluation of instant "poundo" cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta) and yam (Dioscorea rotundata) flours produced by flash and cabinet drying.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Cocoyam, an important staple crop especially among the low-income earners in tropical regions of the world, is highly underutilised for industrial applications. This study investigates the nutritional, colour and rheological properties of instant flours ("poundo") from two cultivars of Colocasia esculenta (white-NCe010 and purple-NCe003) and Dioscorea rotundata (var. Oginni), and sensory attributes of doughs prepared from reconstituted flours. Tubers were processed into instant flours using cabinet and flash drying methods. Significant differences (P< 0.05) in the proximate and mineral composition and pasting properties of flours were found. Sensory panellists rated reconstituted poundo yam (8.17-8.20) and white cocoyam (7.50-7.95) higher than purple cocoyam (6.60-7.10) meals. Influence of drying method on sensory characteristics of flours was not significant. Instant poundo cocoyam and yam flours could serve as novel convenience and ready-to-eat food products which could contribute to increasing the commercial and industrial application options for these underutilised tubers beyond their present basic use. © 2020 Institute of Food, Science and Technology.

J		Adedara, O. A.; Taylor, J. R. N.							Roles of protein, starch and sugar in the texture of sorghum biscuits.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated why biscuits made from sorghum flour have a similar texture to wheat biscuits despite the absence of gluten in sorghum dough. Electron microscopy revealed that the sorghum prolamin protein bodies remained intact in the sorghum biscuits and hence were unlikely to contribute to biscuit structure and texture. Polarized light microscopy showed that the starch granules in the sorghum biscuits were not gelatinized. Increasing dough water content increased the breaking strength and brittleness of sorghum biscuits. However, increasing the proportion of pre-gelatinized sorghum flour in the dough reduced the breaking strength of the sorghum biscuits, indicating that starch gelatinization weakened the biscuit structure. In contrast, increasing the sucrose content of the dough increased sorghum biscuit breaking strength and brittleness. At 20% sucrose (flour basis), the sorghum biscuits had similar breaking strength and brittleness to both Marie and sugar-snap wheat biscuits. DSC and X-ray diffractometry showed that the sugar in both the sorghum and wheat biscuits was in the glassy state and polarized light microscopy revealed that the sugar glass embedded or enveloped the sorghum biscuit flour particles. It is concluded that this sugar glass matrix is responsible for the strength and cohesiveness of the sorghum biscuits.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Andrographis paniculata is a medicinal herb that is used to treat various disease conditions due to its pharmacological properties. Thus, this study sought to assess the effect of A. paniculata extract on neurobehavioral and some biochemical parameters in scopolamine-induced amnesic rats. Thirty-five male rats were divided into seven groups and treated with aqueous extract of A. paniculata (50 and 500 mg/kg) and donepezil (5 mg/kg) for 14 days before administration of scopolamine. Behavioral studies (Morris water maze and Y-maze) were carried out to evaluate cognitive dysfunction in scopolamine-induced rats. Biochemical assays such as cholinesterases (AChE and BChE), monoamine oxidase (MAO), and purinergic activities were determined. Results. Revealed the presence of orientin, quercetin, caffeic acid, apigenin, and gallic acid in A. paniculata. Also, findings from this study showed that aqueous extract of A. paniculata had a modulatory effect on scopolamine-induced cognitive impairment and could be used in the management of memory loss. Practical applications: Aqueous extract of A. paniculata characterized revealed the presence of polyphenols which are antioxidants. The inhibitory activity possessed by A. paniculata on some enzymes linked to neurodegeneration could be due to the antioxidant activity. Given this, we recommend that results gotten from this study could be used to develop treatment therapy for neurodegeneration. However, in-depth studies should be carried out on the toxic effect of A. paniculata to ascertain a safe dose for treatment. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Adefegha, S. A.; Okeke, B. M.; Oboh, G.							Antioxidant properties of eugenol, butylated hydroxylanisole, and butylated hydroxyl toluene with key biomolecules relevant to Alzheimer's diseases-In vitro.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This research work examined and likened effect of eugenol a natural phenolic compound with butylated hydroxylanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxyl toluene (BHT) synthetic phenolic compounds with key biomolecules [acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and monoamine oxidase (MAO)] relevant to Alzheimer's diseases (AD) in vitro. Ten millimolar each sample was prepared in a mixture of ethanol and water (1:1 v/v), and the interactions with AChE, BChE, and MAO were evaluated. Still, ferric reducing antioxidant property, ABTS radicals scavenging ability and lipid peroxidation were carried out. The results revealed eugenol, BHT, and BHA inhibited AChE, BChE, and MAO activities dose-dependently. Though, eugenol had greater inhibitory effect against AChE and BChE activities. Also, eugenol demonstrated higher antioxidant potential compared to BHT and BHA. The potent enzymatic inhibitory and antioxidant effects of eugenol indicate eugenol could be promising as an alternative food additive and neuromodulator in AD management. Practical application. BHT and BHA are synthetic antioxidant employed industrially as food preservative. BHT and BHA are employed in food packaging, drugs, and cosmetics. Although BHT and BHA are widely in use but have been found were associated with alteration in sleeping, induced changes in brain serotonin and norepinephrine levels with increased cholinesterase activity. Endocrine disrupting effects, reproductive disorder is more side effects associated with the use of BHT and BHA. However, eugenol a natural compound found in plants compares favorably with BHT and BHA as antioxidant with many more health promoting benefits such as neuroprotective effects, antiapoptotic effects, and prevent aluminum toxicity. Eugenol being a natural antioxidant with no side effects showing more promising effects over the synthetic phenolic compounds and could be an alternative for the BHT and BHA. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Adefegha, S. A.; Okeke, B. M.; Oyeleye, S. I.; Oboh, G.							Effects of processing on starch composition, glycemic indices, phenolic profile, and possible antidiabetic properties of cassava (Manihot esculenta) flours.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effect of processing on starch composition, glycemic indices (sugar, starch, amylose and amylopectin contents, and estimated glycemic index [eGI]), phenolic profiles, and alpha-amylase and glucosidase inhibitory effects of cassava (Manihot esculenta) flours was investigated in vitro. Roasted cassava flours had higher starch, amylopectin, and amylose contents but lower sugar and phenolic contents compared to sun-dried cassava flour. Roasted cassava flour showed higher alpha-amylase and lower alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activity than sun-dried flour. Roasted cassava flour possessed higher content of gallic and caffeic acids, catechin, quercetin, and kampferol, while sun-dried cassava flour is rich in chlorogenic and ellagic acids and rutin. This study revealed that different processing confers changes in the starch composition and biological effects cassava flour. However, roasted cassava showed promising dietary intervention in diabetes management than sun-dried cassava flour. Practical applications. Different traditional processing methods employed in the processing of cassava tuber reduce toxicity and enhances palatability and durability of fresh cassava root into stable products. Cassava starch is used industrially for the preparation of products such as glucose and as a thickening agent. The findings of this research showed that roasting as well as sun drying causes changes in the starch composition and biological effects of cassava flour. Thus, roasted showed promising dietary intervention in diabetes management than sun-dried flour. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Antioxidant activities of Celosia argentea Linn and Gongronema latifolium Benth and the antihyperlipidemic effect of the vegetable supplemented diets on fat induced hyperlipidemic rats.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The present study investigated the antioxidant activities and antihyperlipidemic effects of varying levels of inclusion of processed green leafy vegetables (Celosia argentea and Gongronema latifolium) on high fat diet-induced hyperlipidemic rats. The antioxidant assay revealed that the unblanched C. argentea had higher total phenolic content, total flavonoid content, DPPH, ABTS+, OH and NO radical scavenging activities than the blanched Celosia argentea. Conversely, the blanched G. latifolium had higher antioxidant activities than the unblanched G. latifolium. Seventy-five (75) male albino rats of average weight 18020 g were divided into fifteen (15) groups of five (5) animals each. The rats were fed for 4 weeks on diets specially formulated to contain 5%, 10% and 15% by weight of the leaves of the blanched and unblanched vegetables. Lipid profile (TC: total cholesterol, TG: triglycerides, LDL: low density lipoproteins, VLDL: very low density lipoproteins and HDL: high density lipoproteins) and oxidative stress indicators were evaluated. The serum TC, TG, LDL and VLDL which significantly increased (p<0.0001) in hyperlipidemic control group were significantly decreased (p<0.05,0.0001) at all levels of inclusion of the vegetal diets. HDL also increased significantly (p<0.0001) in groups fed with the vegetal diets. In addition, glutathione peroxidase, reduced glutathione, catalase and superoxide dismutase activities significantly increased (p<0.05, 0.0001); while TBARS significantly decreased at all levels of inclusion of the vegetal diets. These results suggested that incorporation of C. argentea and G. latifolium into the diet most especially blanched C. argentea and unblanched G. latifolium may have therapeutic potentials in the management of hyperlipidemia and associated complications. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	425	436	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00612-z					FSTA:2021-06-Jq7235

Effect of fermentation on nutritional quality, growth and hematological parameters of rats fed sorghum-soybean-orange flesh sweet potato complementary diet.		Food Science & Nutrition					The protein quality of complementary foods developed from fermented and unfermented sorghum, soybeans, and orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flour blends was evaluated using rat model. The test diet was as follows: UF2: unfermented sorghum (56%), soybean (17%), and OFSP (27%); UF3: unfermented sorghum (59%), soybean (31%), and OFSP (10%); F2: fermented sorghum (56%), soybean (17%), and OFSP (27%); and F3: fermented sorghum (59%), soybean (31%), and OFSP (10%), while cerelac served as positive control, corn starch (basal diet), and ogi (negative control). Forty-nine Wistar albino rats were grouped and fed with diets for 28 days. The growth, hematological, serum parameters of animals, protein quality, and proximate composition of developed diet were determined. Fermentation significantly improved the protein content and nutritional indices of experimental animals. Moisture content ranged from 2.5% to 9.24%, protein (7.09%-25.29%), ash (1.09%-3.71%), fat (10.28%-15.24%), and fiber (0.85%-3.17%). The biological values (BV) ranged from 75.11% to 78.44%. The weight gained in rat fed the formulated diet ranged from 46.0 g to 77.3 g and was highest in F3. The packed cell volume (PCV), hemoglobin concentration (HBC), red blood cell (RBC), and lymphocytes were highest in F3. Urea nitrogen and creatinine of the rats fed with formulated diets ranged from 3.58 to 15.32 mg/dl and 1.56 to 6.15 mg/dl, respectively. Sample F3 is a protein-rich complementary food that is comparable to ogi and suitable to manage malnutrition and support growth in children. However, clinical trials on the formulated diet are needed to further substantiate its nutritional potentials. © 2020 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Adel Bakhshipour; Hemad Zareiforoush; Iraj Bagheri							Mathematical and intelligent modeling of stevia (Stevia Rebaudiana) leaves drying in an infrared-assisted continuous hybrid solar dryer.		Food Science & Nutrition					Drying characteristics of stevia leaves were investigated in an infrared (IR)-assisted continuous-flow hybrid solar dryer. Drying experiments were conducted at the inlet air temperatures of 30, 40, and 50 °C, air inlet velocities of 7, 8, and 9 m/s, and IR lamp input powers of 0,150, and 300 W. The results indicated that inlet air temperature and IR lamp input power had significant effect on drying time (p<.05). A comparative study was performed among mathematical, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy System (ANFIS) models for predicting the experimental moisture ratio (MR) of stevia leaves during the drying process. The ANN model was the most accurate MR predictor with coefficient of determination (R2), root mean squared error (RMSE), and chi-squared error (chi2) values of 0.9995, 0.0005, and 0.0056, respectively, on test dataset. These values of the ANFIS model on test dataset were 0.9936, 0.0243, and 0.0202, respectively. Among the mathematical models, the Midilli model was the best-fitted model to experimental MR values in most of the drying conditions. It was concluded that artificial intelligence modeling is an effective approach for accurate prediction of the drying kinetics of stevia leaves in the continuous-flow IR-assisted hybrid solar dryer. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Adel G. Abdel-Razek; Ahmed N. Badr; Salman S. Alharthi; Khaled A. Selim							Efficacy of bottle gourd seeds' extracts in chemical hazard reduction secreted as toxigenic fungi metabolites.		Toxins					Bottle gourd seeds are surrounded by innumerable bioactive components of phytochemicals. This work aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of bottle gourd extracts as antimicrobial and anti-mycotoxigenic against toxigenic fungi and mycotoxins. Polar and nonpolar extracts were made from the seeds. The polar eco-friendly extract was prepared by an ultrasonication-assisted technique utilizing aqueous isopropanol (80%), whereas the non-polar extract was obtained using petroleum ether (40-60). The antioxidant efficacy, total phenolic content, and flavonoid content of the extracts were all measured. The fatty acid profile was measured using GC equipment, and the influence on toxigenic fungus and mycotoxin release was also investigated. The antioxidant efficacy of the polar extract is reflected. The total phenolic values of the oil and polar extract were 15.5 and 267 mg of GAE/g, respectively. The total flavonoid content of the oil was 2.95 mg catechol/g, whereas the isopropyl extract of seeds contained 14.86 mg catechol/g. The polar extract inhibited the DPPH more effectively than oil. When compared to other seed oils, the fatty acid composition differed. The pathogens were distinguished by the MIC and MFC for the polar extract. Three sterols were found in the oil, with a high concentration of B-sitosterols. The oil's valuable-carotene content and tocopherol content were recorded. When compared to traditional antibiotics, the polar extract has shown promising antimicrobial activity against infections and toxigenic fungi. Bottle gourd extracts, as a non-traditional bioactive source, are viewed as a potentially promising alternative that might contribute to increased food safety, shelf-life, and security. © 2021 by the authors.

In vitro alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory activities, antioxidant activity, in vivo glycemic response and nutritional quality of dough meals from Dioscorea alata and Vernonia amygdalina.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In all age groups globally, diabetes is a metabolic disease that is associated with oxidative stress caused by reactive free radicals in the human system. In folklore medicine, plants based diets such as unripe plantain, and water yam are used in management of diabetes. Hence, this study aimed to determine the antioxidant, alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, glycemic index, blood glucose concentration and sensory attributes of dough meals developed from flour blends of unripe plantain, water yam and bitter leaf. A remarkable free radical scavenging activity and ferric ion reducing power was observed as the supplementation increased with water yam. The inhibition of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities by the dough meal was dependent on the percentage inclusion of water yam and this indicates the antihyperglycemic potential of the dough meal. The glycemic index of rat fed with the dough meal was significantly low at 40% water yam supplementation compared to 100% unripe plantain dough meal. Hence, the study provides a rationale that dough meal from unripe plantain; water yam and bitter leaf have the potential to be used as functional foods to alleviate postprandial hyperglycemia. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4083	4097	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00965-z					FSTA:2022-01-Mq0403
J		Ademola, O.; Saha Turna, N.; Liverpool-tasie, L. S. O.; Obadina, A.; Felicia Wu							Mycotoxin reduction through lactic acid fermentation: evidence from commercial ogi processors in southwest Nigeria.		Food Control					This work demonstrates the feasibility of a traditional food processing method to reduce mycotoxins (toxins produced by foodborne molds) in commercial processing plants in Nigeria. Aflatoxin, a commonly occurring mycotoxin in maize and nuts, causes liver cancer in humans, and has also been implicated in child growth impairment and immunotoxicity. Although fumonisin, another mycotoxin in maize, has not been conclusively linked to any human diseases, it causes multiple adverse effects in other animal species and may play a contributory role in neural tube defects and growth impairment in human children. This study examined the impact of lactic acid fermentation, a food processing method used for millennia across multiple human populations, to decrease aflatoxins and fumonisins in maize products in Nigeria. We assessed the prevalence of four aflatoxins and three fumonisins in matched samples of maize grain and a Nigerian porridge ogi (before and after processing) obtained from commercial ogi processors in three southwestern Nigerian states. After processing, the mean total aflatoxin level in the final product was typically close to the maximum acceptable limit shared by Nigeria and the European Union: 4 mug/kg. Lactic acid fermentation significantly reduced fumonisin levels in maize. As ogi is a common weaning food for Nigerian children, the fermentation process used to produce it is potentially beneficial in reducing mycotoxin-related health risks in a sensitive population. It is encouraging to see that mycotoxin reductions occur even in commercial ogi production settings. However, the ultimate fate of these toxins warrants further investigation before this can be recommended as a public health intervention.

J		Ademosun, A. O.; Oboh, G.; Ajeigbe, O. F.							Antioxidant activities and glycemic indices of ice creams enriched with orange (Citrus sinensis) and shaddock (Citrus maxima) peels and effects on rat lipid profiles.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study evaluated the effects of ice creams produced from blends of orange (Citrus sinensis) and shaddock (Citrus maxima) peels on the blood lipid profile, glycemic index, and antioxidant indices in the liver and heart of rats. Formulated ice cream was produced at a different proportion of citrus (orange and shaddock) blends and fed to rats for 28 days. The result showed that the formulated ice cream enriched with citrus peels blends caused a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol level in the plasma and antioxidant status in the liver and heart homogenates, decreased the glycemic index, concentration of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein in the plasma as against rats fed on plain and commercial ice creams. To conclude, the use of ice creams from blends of orange and shaddock peels could serve as a functional food for weight reduction, glycemic index, management of lipid-related diseases, and prevention of oxidative stress-related complications in the liver and heart. Practical applications. The consumption of ice creams has increased in many parts of the world. However, there have been limited efforts aimed at improving the medicinal properties of frozen dairy products. Hence, these ice creams could be produced on a large scale under regulated condition since they have improved medicinal properties which would be a good option for preventing/combating degenerative conditions and their related complications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Ademosun, A. O.; Odanye, O. S.; Oboh, G.							Orange peel flavored unripe plantain noodles with low glycemic index improved antioxidant status and reduced blood glucose levels in diabetic rats.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study sought to produce antioxidant-rich, low glycemic index noodles with hypoglycemic properties using composite blends of various percentage compositions of wheat flour, unripe plantain (Musa sapientum Linn. Var. paradisiaca) flour and orange (Citrus sinensis) peels. Composite mixtures of the unripe plantain-flour (UPF) and wheat flour (WF) were prepared at various percentages (90%WF, 0%UPF: 85%WF, 5%UPF: 75%WF, 15%UPF: 65%WF and 25%UPF: 55%WF and 35%UPF) and mixed with 10% of orange peel powder for the production of the different noodles samples. The sensory properties, phenolic distribution, glycemic indices, amylose and amylopectin contents of the noodles were determined. Thereafter the effect of the samples on blood glucose levels, antioxidant status and carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes (alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase) were assessed in diabetic rats. W55-UP35 had the highest total phenol and flavonoid contents. The glycemic indices of the noodles ranged from 35 (W55-UP35) to 58 (W90). The diabetic rats that consumed W55-UP35 had the biggest reduction in blood glucose levels and the least alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities. Similarly, the rats fed with W55-UP35 showed the strongest antioxidant status.

J		Adenitan, A. A.; Awoyale, W.; Akinwande, B. A.; Busie, M. D.; Michael, S.							Mycotoxin profiles of solar tent-dried and open sun-dried plantain chips.		Food Control					Plantain is a popular dietary staple in Central and West African countries due to its versatility and excellent nutritional value. Mature unripe plantain finger is usually processed into dried chips by processors using open sun-drying method to reduce the moisture content and extends its shelf life, but without controlling the unit operations that affect product quality. Thus, this study aimed at assessing the mycotoxin profile of solar tent-dried and open sun-dried plantain chips in Nigeria. Fifty (50) dried plantain chips [10 samples produced from the solar tent-dried, 10 samples from open sun dried, and 30 samples from local processors (9 from Akure South and 21 from Idanre Local Governments)] were analyzed for constituent mycotoxins using Liquid Chromatography Tandem-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The result reveals that all the regulated mycotoxins (Aflatoxin B1, B2, G1, G2, Ochratoxin A, Fumonisin B1, Fumonisin B2, Zearalenone, T-2 Toxin, HT-2 Toxin and, Deoxynivalenol) were below the detectable limits in the dried plantain chips. Aflatoxin B1 and G1, which were considered as the most regulated mycotoxin, were below the limits of detection (0.16-0.22 mug/kg) in all the samples. Only 23 analytes were detected at concentrations higher than their respective limits of detection (LOD) in 2% or more of the 50 dried plantain chips investigated, with reference to the prevalence of the non-regulated mycotoxins. Thus, all regulated mycotoxins produced by Aspergillus, Penicillium and Fusarium as stipulated by the Commission of the European Union were found at concentrations which are toxicologically acceptable in many other crops, particularly in the solar tent-dried plantain chips compared to those from the open sun-dried and local processors. Therefore, the use of a solar tent in drying plantain chips and other agricultural products is encouraged for the safety of human consumption. The outcome of this study provides useful information regarding the possible safety of plantain chips in Nigeria. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Propionate and dietary fermentable fibers upregulate intestinal heat shock protein70 in intestinal Caco-2 cells and mouse colon.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including propionate, are major metabolites of intestinal microorganisms and play an essential role in regulating intestinal epithelial integrity. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) promote cellular homeostasis under physiological and stressed conditions. This study aimed to investigate the regulation of intestinal HSP70 by propionate in human intestinal Caco-2 cells and the colon of fermentable dietary fiber (DF)-fed mice and germ-free mice. The results showed that propionate increased Hspa1a (HSP70 mRNA) level in Caco-2 cells, upregulated HSP70 protein, and phosphorylation of heat shock factor 1; however, the latter two were reduced by mitogen-activated protein kinases and the mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors. Feeding fermentable DFs, such as guar gum (GG) and partially hydrolyzed GG, increased both cecal SCFAs and colonic HSP70 expression, both of which were reduced in germ-free mice than in specific-pathogen-free mice. Collectively, the propionate-induced HSP70 expression was shown to be possibly involved in intestinal homeostasis.										2021	69	30	8460	8470	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03036					FSTA:2021-12-Tb4765
J		Adesulu-Dahunsi, A. T.; Sanni, A. I.; Jeyaram, K.							Diversity and technological characterization of Pediococcus pentosaceus strains isolated from Nigerian traditional fermented foods.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The diversity and technological properties of Pediococcus pentosaceus strains, isolated from some traditional fermented foods in Nigeria, were studied with the aim of selecting suitable strains as a starter and/or adjunct cultures. Eighteen lactic acid bacteria isolates from ogi, gari and fufu were presumptively identified as Pediococcus species using the conventional methods, these isolates were screened for technological and safety properties such as exopolysaccharide production, acidifying activity, antimicrobial activity, and biogenic amine production. The LAB isolates were further differentiated by using internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) molecular typing techniques. The Pediococcus sp. displayed antimicrobial activities against Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Enterococcus faecium. They all had high acidifying activities and were able to reduce the pH to lower than 5.20 after 24h. Pediococcus pentosaceus OF31 showed interesting potential technological characteristics due to its antimicrobial activity and exopolysaccharide production. The combination of RAPD-PCR (using primers OPA20 and M13) and PFGE-SfiI genotypic fingerprinting technique allows successful intraspecific differentiation. The present study confirmed the presence of exopolysaccharide-producing strain of P. pentosaceus in indigenous fermented foods which could be used as autochthonous starter culture to impart more functional attributes to fermented foods.

J		Adetuyi, B. O.; Farombi, E. O.							6-Gingerol, an active constituent of ginger, attenuates lipopolysaccharide-induced oxidation, inflammation, cognitive deficits, neuroplasticity, and amyloidogenesis in rat.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study examined the protective effect of 6-Gingerol (6G) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cognitive impairments, oxidative stress, neuroplasticity, amyloidogenesis, and inflammation. Male rats were allocated into six groups in this manner; Group I placed on normal saline only. Group II was treated for 7 days with LPS alone intraperitoneally at 250 g/kg body weight (bw). Group III received 6G alone at 50 mg/kg bw orally for 14 days. Groups IV and V received 6G at 20 and 50 mg/kg bw for 7 days, respectively, and LPS for another 7 days to induce neurotoxicity. Group VI received 5 mg/kg bw of donepezil for 7 days and LPS for 7 days. Pretreatment with 20 and 50 mg/kg bw of 6G protected against LPS-mediated learning and memory function, and also locomotor and motor deficits. Besides, 20 and 50 mg/kg bw 6G mitigated LPS-induced alteration in markers of oxidative stress. Furthermore, induction of amyloidogenesis associated with disruption of histoarchitecture and high expression of interleukin 1beta, inducible nitric oxide synthase, amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor by LPS was mitigated by the two doses of 6G in the rat hippocampus and cerebral cortex region of the brain. 6G pretreatment at the two doses mitigated LPS-mediated histopathological changes in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats. Overall, our results demonstrate that the protective effect of 6G is mediated through the reversal of neurobehavioral deficit, oxidative stress, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis, thus making 6G a possible chemoprophylactic agent against brain injury as a result of LPS exposure. Practical applications. In the search for a holistic prevention of inflammation-associated neurodegeneration, nutraceuticals are becoming prominent. Hence, this study presents 6G, an active constituent of ginger, as a chemoprotective, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory agent, which is able to ameliorate cognitive impairments, oxidative stress, neuroplasticity, amyloidogenesis, and inflammation in LPS-induced rat model of neuroinflammation. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13660					FSTA:2021-08-Te3077
J		Adewale, O. O.; Bakare, M. I.; Adetunji, J. B.							Mechanism underlying nephroprotective property of curcumin against sodium nitrite-induced nephrotoxicity in male Wistar rat.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The current work examined the outcome of curcumin (20 mg/kg body weight/day) administration on arginase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activities and other kidney markers, as well as markers of oxidative stress, in Wistar rats exposed to sodium nitrite (NaNO2) (60 mg/kg of body weight, single dose) for 28 days. The results revealed that the NaNO2 exposed rats had significantly altered the ADA activities, arginase activities alongside other biomarkers of kidney function, and oxidative stress. However, pretreatment with curcumin significantly mitigated the altered activities ADA and arginase as well as other parameters. This was supported by the histopathological examination of the kidney tissues. Our findings suggest that the alteration in the activities of ADA and arginase could be involved in the mechanism of action employed by NaNO2 and curcumin in the respective induction and prevention of nephrotoxicity. Practical applications. These results suggest that moderate exposure to the acceptable daily dose of curcumin can improve food-related kidney damage through regulations of ADA and arginase activities, enhancement in the antioxidant system, and suppression of lipid peroxidation. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Onion leaf and synthetic additives in broiler diet: impact on splenic cytokines, serum immunoglobulins, cecal bacterial population, and muscle antioxidant status.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The disadvantages associated with the use of synthetic additives in animal production could threaten human and animal health, and the safety of animal-derived foods. This study assessed the growth performance, blood chemistry, immune indices, selected caeca bacterial population, muscle antioxidant enzyme activities, and meat quality in broiler chickens fed diet supplemented with antibiotic (70% oxytetracycline+30% neomycin), tert-butylhydroxytoluene or onion leaf powder (OLP). One day old Ross 308 chicks (n=240) were assigned randomly to either D-1, control diet (CD) without additives; D-2, CD+ 0.3 gkg-1 antibiotic+0.15gkg-1tert-butylhydroxytoluene; D-3, CD + 2.5 gkg-1 OLP; or D-4, CD+ 5 gkg-1 OLP for 42days. Results. The D-2 and D-4 diets improved (P< 0.05) bodyweight gain and feed efficiency in broilers. Platelet and cecal Lactobacillus spp. Counts were higher (P< 0.05) whereas muscle cholesterol was lower (P<0.05) in the OLP-supplemented birds. Supplemented birds had higher (P< 0.01) splenic interleukin-10 and lower (P< 0.01) splenic tumor necrosis factor-alpha, immunoglobulin A, cecal E. coli and C. perfringens counts compared with the D-1 birds. The D-4 birds had the least (P< 0.05) splenic interleukin-1 beta. Dietary supplements increased (P< 0.05) catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and total antioxidant capacity, and lowered (P< 0.05) drip loss, malondialdehyde and carbonyl content in breast meat. Conclusion. Dietary supplementation of 5 gkg-1 OLP exerted antimicrobial, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant effects that were comparable to those of antibiotics and tert-butylhydroxytoluene in broiler chickens. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Efficacy of postharvest sodium nitroprusside application to extend storability by regulating physico-chemical quality of pear fruit.		Food Chemistry					Quality loss in pear fruit during storage reduces its marketability for long run. To increase its storability, the efficacy of postharvest dip treatment donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) 0.000, 0.001, 0.002 and 0.003 mol L-1 were investigated on pear fruit cv. Patharnakh under storage conditions (low temperature 0-1 °C and relative humidity (90-95%)). SNP effectively lowered fruit mass loss, retained colour and higher firmness, suppressed browning and respiration rate and sustained soluble solids content, titratable acidity, total phenol content and ascorbic acid thus conserved the fruit quality for longer period. SNP treatments suppressed the activity of polyphenol oxidase and increased activity of superoxide dismutase enzyme. Additionally, the SNP treated fruit exhibited lesser activities of fruit softening enzymes like pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase and cellulase. Among all, 0.002 mol L-1 SNP concentration was superior to lengthen storability and sensory quality of pear up to 60 d under cold storage. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Nutritional, anti-nutritional, antioxidant, physicochemical and functional characterization of Australian acacia seed: effect of species and regions.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Acacia seed (AS) is an underutilized legume widely distributed in the world, with majority of the species (>70%) found in Australia. Generally, the seeds are not only rich in protein, dietary fibre and potassium, but also possess anti-nutritional compounds. In recent years, there have been an increase in the cultivation of some Australian acacia species such as Acacia victoriae, Acacia cowleana and Acacia coriacea from different regions. However, there is limited information on the composition, anti-nutrients, antioxidant and functional properties of flour from these widely grown Australian AS species. Thus, the present study aimed to assess the properties of these Australian AS species from different geographical regions. Results. The A. cowleana and A. coriacea were characterized by high protein, fat, potassium and soluble carbohydrate. However, higher starch and fibre contents were present in A. victoriae. Greater amounts of anti-nutrients, total phenolics and flavonoids were found in A. cowleana and A. coriacea seeds, whereas A. victoriae had higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical-scavenging capacity. A. victoriae and A. coriacea demonstrated the highest water absorption and solubility index, respectively. However, A. cowleana showed the highest oil absorption index. There was less variation in the composition and properties within species from different regions. Conclusion. All samples showed promising nutritional characteristics, although with sufficient diversity to indicate that Australian acacia seeds can be utilized to develop a range of new (functional) food products. Overall, the information obtained will help the food industries with the selection of AS species for food application. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Adil Aldhahrani							Protective effects of guarana (Paullinia cupana) against methotrexate-induced intestinal damage in mice.		Food Science & Nutrition					This study aimed to examine the effects of guarana (Paullinia cupana) on intestinal damage induced by MTX in mice. Mice were classified into four groups: control, MTX, guarana (Paullinia cupana), and guarana (Paullinia cupana) together with MTX. Total antioxidant capacity together with glutathione, superoxide dismutase, MDA, ALT, AST, myeloperoxidase, total protein and IL-1beta were detected in the serum. Bax and Bcl2 expressions were detected in intestine together with histopathological examination and immunohistochemical examination of caspase-9. Intoxication with MTX inhibited antioxidant and promoted myeloperoxidase activity in experimental mouse models but pre-administration of guarana ameliorated this effect by inhibiting IL-1beta. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis found that MTX intoxication upregulated BAX expression, causing apoptosis, and downregulated Bcl2 expression. These were also brought under control following guarana pre-administration. Histological examination of intestine indicated hyperplasia and desquamation of superficial epithelium of villi in the MTX-administered group, as well as round cell infiltration in the lamina propria. Pre-administration of guarana protected against these effects. The MTX group showed that caspase-9 expression was upregulated, increasing immune-reactivity in comparison to the guarana experimental groups. These combined effects lead to the conclusion that guarana has a preventative or protective effect against MTX-induced oxidative stress in the intestinal tissue. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					The physicochemical properties, swelling power, solubility, and digestibility of flour from four rice varieties (black, brown, white, and waxy rice flour) were analyzed. The results showed that the black and brown rice had high-amylose percentage (21.8% and 20.5%), a relatively low percentage of starch content (68.1% and 79.1%), and lower swelling power (6.6% and 7.6%) and solubility (13.5% and 15.7%), respectively. Waxy rice flour attributed to lower gelatinization temperatures and higher enthalpy values. Meanwhile, the brown, black, and white rice showed higher gelatinization temperature and lower enthalpy value. The black and brown rice flour exhibited lower pasting and viscosity values as compared to waxy rice flour. The results showed that all rice flour had an A-type X-ray diffraction pattern, and after cooking all rice flour showed V-type polymorphs except waxy rice flour. Brown and black rice flour after cooking have lower digestion rate than white rice and waxy rice flour, probably due to its lower expansion and solubility rates, and higher gelatinization temperature. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Adil Nawaz, M.; Kumar Singh, T.; Stockmann, R.; Jegasothy, H.; Buckow, R.							Quality attributes of ultra-high temperature-treated model beverages prepared with faba bean protein concentrates.		Foods					The objective of this research was to develop a model faba bean drink with a high concentration of protein (>4% w/w). The protein molecular weights and frequency for both faba and soy were assessed using SDS-PAGE. Results showed similarities in the protein molecular weight of both faba and soy (mainly 11S globulin ~Glycinin and 7S globulin ~beta-conglycinin). Thus, faba can be considered as a potential soy replica in plant-based milk beverages. Oil-in-water emulsions (5-8% w/w available protein) were prepared using faba bean protein concentrate (FPC), 1% sunflower oil, and 0.2% sunflower lecithin. These emulsions were used as model beverages and were further investigated for UHT processibility, stability, and physicochemical properties. The physicochemical properties of emulsions at various processing stages viz., coarse emulsification, homogenisation, and UHT, were measured. An increase in the protein concentration and thermal treatment resulted in an increased oil droplet size, coalescence and flocculation, and protein aggregation. Lower protein concentrations viz., 5-6%, showed greater negative zeta-potential, and thereby, high dispersibility through enhanced electrostatic repulsions than those of higher concentrations (7-8%). Furthermore, an increase in protein concentration and UHT treatment resulted in an increased creaming index. In total, 21 different volatile compounds were detected and quantified, representing different chemical classes, namely alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, esters, furan, and acids. These volatiles have major consequences for the overall flavour chemistry of the model beverage product. Overall, this study showed the potential for application of faba bean as a protein source in UHT-treated legume-based beverages and identified areas for further development. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Adila Naseem; Saeed Akhtar; Faisal Manzoor, M.; Aysha Sameen; Anam Layla; Khurram Afzal; Emad Karrar; Abdul Rahaman; Tariq Ismail; Nazir Ahmad; Azhari Siddeeg							Effect of herbal formulation intake on health indices in albino Wistar rat model.		Food Science & Nutrition					Dyslipidemia management activity of ginger-, garlic-, and lemon-based herbal mixture was tested as paste and herbal extract in hypercholesterolemic adult male albino rats. Atherogenic diet-induced hypercholesterolemia in rats was treated by supplementing the diet with 2.5% herbal paste (4.2 g/kg b.w.) or 2.5 ml oral gavage (20 ml/kg b.w.) of liquid herbal extract daily for 42 days. Hematological and serological outcomes of herbal formulation feeding were compared with the cholesterol-fed positive control and normal control. The results suggest the significant (p<.05) inhibitory properties of herbal paste and liquid extracts against dyslipidemia showing 31%-37%, 62%-68%, and 40%-56% lower levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides (TGs), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), respectively. Treating cholesterol-fed animals with herbal paste and extract significantly (p<.05) increased total protein (5-5.5 g/dl) and serum albumin (3.7-4.2 g/dl) concentration as compared to the normal control. Contrary to significant hypocholesterolemic activity, higher serum total bilirubin levels, that is, 0.70 mg/dl, were observed in rats subchronically exposed to herbal paste and liquid extracts. Nonsignificant (p>.05) impact of herbal formula feeding was observed on hematological indices except lymphocyte counts, that is, 93% in rats fed on herbal paste. The results validate conventional hypocholesterolemic claims associated with ginger-, garlic-, and lemon-based herbal formulations; however, deeper insight into their dose-dependent response in hypercholesterolemia is necessitated to rule out the toxicological impact on the consumer. © 2020 The Authors.

CuO nanoparticles/Indonesian cedarwood essential oil-loaded chitosan coating film: characterisation and antifungal improvement against Penicillium spp.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					A novel formulation of composite coating comprising 0.8% chitosan (Chi) incorporating 0.025% CuO nanoparticles (CuO) and 0.5% Indonesian cedarwood essential oil (CEO) was fabricated by casting method. Fourier transform infrared, confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy analyses were employed to characterise the biocompatibility of each formulation. Additionally, the physico-chemically properties of the composite coatings were characterised. The colour (L*), light transmission, zeta potential and roughness of Chi were significantly (P< 0.05) altered negatively by the presence of CuO or CEO; the colour (a*, b* and DeltaE), apparent viscosity and transparency also changed positively as a consequence of CuO and CEO incorporation. The antifungal features of a pure Chi coating against Penicillium italicum and Penicillium digitatum were improved synergistically by CuO and CEO, confirmed by in vitro and in vivo assays. Composite coatings obtained in this work may have potential applications for active primary food packaging, particularly for fresh postharvest commodities. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	9	4224	4238	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15195					FSTA:2022-01-Fe0171
J		Adjemian, M. K.; Smith, A.; Wendi He							Estimating the market effect of a trade war: the case of soybean tariffs.		Food Policy					In 2018, China retaliated to U.S. trade actions by levying a 25% retaliatory tariff on U.S. soybean exports. That tariff shifted market preferences so that Chinese buyers-who make up a substantial share of total world consumption-favored Brazilian soybeans. We use the relative price of a substitute (RPS) method to estimate that the resulting trade disruption effectively drove a wedge into the world soybean market, lowering U.S. Prices at Gulf export locations by $0.74/bu on average for about five months, and increasing Brazilian prices by about $0.97/bu, compared to what would have been observed without the tariff in place. By the end of that period, world markets adjusted and the soybean prices in both countries returned to the ex-ante state of near parity, even if U.S. Export volume did not recover until the end of the following marketing year. Our price impact estimate is substantially lower than subsequent U.S. Government "trade aid" payments to American soybean producers: although actual payments to producers varied based on county-level differences, USDA's nominal calculation of the commodity-specific payment rate for soybeans under MFP summed to $3.70 for two bushels produced over the course of two years. We project that USDA's near-$8.5 billion in trade aid to U.S. Soybean producers exceeded the tariff damage by about $5.4 billion. These difference could be attributed to USDA's broader definition of "economic injury", beyond the short-run price impacts we estimate. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Adjognon, G. S.; Bloem, J. R.; Sanoh, A.							The coronavirus pandemic and food security: evidence from Mali.		Food Policy					This paper documents some of the first estimates of changes in experienced food insecurity associated with the coronavirus pandemic in a low-income country. It combines nationally representative pre-pandemic household survey data with follow-up phone survey data from Mali and examines sub-national variation in the intensity of pandemic-related disruptions between urban and rural areas. Although rural households are more likely to experience food insecurity prior to the pandemic, we find that food insecurity increased more in urban areas than in rural areas. Just three months after the onset of the pandemic, the rural-urban gap in experienced food insecurity completely vanished. These findings highlight that understanding effect heterogeneity is critically important to effectively designing and targeting post-pandemic humanitarian assistance.

Occurrence and associated factors of aflatoxin M1 in raw cow milk in South Gondar Zone, North West Ethiopia, 2020.		Food Science & Nutrition					Aflatoxin M1 is the most significant toxin of milk and milk products. It is immunosuppressive, mutagenic, and carcinogenic compounds to humans. Therefore, this study was aimed to evaluate the concentration of aflatoxin M1 and its determinants in raw cow milk sample intended for human consumption in South Gondar Zone, Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a total of 100 dairy farmers from January to February 2020. Around 50ml, 100 raw milk samples were collected for aflatoxin M1 analysis. A simple random sampling technique was applied to get the households. Binary and multivariate logistic regressions were used to see the association between predictor and outcome variables. From the 100 dairy farmers who had participated, 38% had heard about aflatoxin in the milk sample. Aflatoxin M1 was detected in the 99 (99%) raw milk samples, of these 41 (41%) exceeded the limit of the European Union. The logistic regression analysis result showed that residence, awareness about the level of aflatoxin in the milk sample, management mold-contaminated animal feed, animal feed storage facility, and grazing systems were significantly associated with the high level of aflatoxin in the milk sample. Almost all milk samples analyzed were positive for aflatoxin M1, and 41% of samples were above the limit set by European Union.

J		Adnan Iftekhar; Xiaohui Cui							Blockchain-based traceability system that ensures food safety measures to protect consumer safety and COVID-19 free supply chains.		Foods					The world is facing an unprecedented socio-economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19). The virus is also spreading through the import and export food supply chains. The Chinese authorities have discovered the COVID-19 virus in various imported frozen meat packages. Traceability plays a vital role in food quality and food safety. The Internet of Things (IoT) provides solutions to overseeing environmental conditions, product quality, and product traceability. These solutions are traditionally based on a centralized architecture, which does not guarantee tamper-proof data sharing. The blockchain is an emerging technology that provides tamper-proof data sharing in real-time. This article presents a blockchain-enabled supply chain architecture to ensure the availability of a tamper-proof audit trail. This tamper-proof audit trail helps to make sure that all safety measures are undertaken to minimize the risk of COVID-19 and other bacteria, fungi, and parasites being present in the frozen meat supply chain. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Adnan Iftekhar; Xiaohui Cui; Yiping Yang							Blockchain technology for trustworthy operations in the management of strategic grain reserves.		Foods					Food is a daily requirement for everyone, while production patterns are seasonal. Producing sufficient nutrients is becoming more difficult because water and soil resources are already stressed and are becoming increasingly strained by climate change. Improving food security requires expertise in various areas, including sophisticated climate models, genetics research, market and household behaviour modelling, political shock modelling, and comprehensive environmental research. Additionally, governments stockpile grains to enhance national food security. These reserves should engage in markets only according to clear and transparent regulations and within defined price ranges to facilitate market functioning. It increases the demand for better technology in public administration to boost the management and distribution capacity while concentrating on improved controls and transparent governance systems. Blockchain technology emerges as a promising technology to enhance visibility, transparency, and data integrity with an immutable distributed ledger to increase trust in the parties' business transactions. This paper discusses blockchain technology and its potential role in strategic grain reserve management. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					In this study, 10% of chicken protein isolate (CPI) and quercetin (1 mg/mL) were used to develop an edible coating to improve the oxidative stability of deep-fat-fried chicken drumsticks during refrigerated storage (4 °C) for 10 days. Chicken samples with edible coating formulated with only 10% CPI served as the control. Although the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values of the treated samples were lower than the control samples, no significant differences were observed. Quercetin-treated samples were generally harder than control samples. The pH was reduced by quercetin incorporation (p< 0.05). L* and b* values increased, while there was no significant variation in a* values during storage (p> 0.05). © 2021 by the authors.

Shariff; Nurul Huda							Not all street food is bad: low prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica in ready-to-eat (RTE) meats in Ghana is associated with good vendors' knowledge of meat safety.		Foods					Foodborne infections due to the consumption of meat is a significant threat to public health. However, good vendor and consumer knowledge of meat safety could prevent meat contamination with and transmission of foodborne pathogens like Salmonella. Thus, this study investigated the vendor and consumer perception, knowledge, and practices of meat safety regarding ready-to-eat (RTE) meat and how this affected the prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of Salmonella enterica in RTE meats in the streets of Ghana. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to obtain the demographics, knowledge, and practices of meat safety data from RTE meat vendors (n=300) and consumers (n=382). Salmonella enterica detection was done according to the United State of America (USA)-Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) Bacteriological Analytical Manual. The disk diffusion method was used for antibiotic resistance testing. The results revealed that most of the respondents had heard of meat safety (98.3% vendors, 91.8% consumers) and knew that meat could be contaminated by poor handling (100.0% vendors, 88.9% consumers). The respondents knew that regular hand washing reduced the risk of meat contamination (100.0% vendors, 94.0% consumers). Responses to the practices of meat safety by vendors were generally better. A very low Salmonella enterica prevalence was observed in the samples, ranging between 0.0 and 4.0% for guinea fowl and beef, respectively. However, the six isolates obtained were resistant to five of the nine antibiotics tested, with all isolates displaying different resistance profiles. Overall, the good knowledge and practice of meat safety demonstrated by the respondents corroborated the negligible prevalence of Salmonella in this study, reiterating the importance of vendor meat safety knowledge. However, the presence of resistant Salmonella enterica in some of the meat samples, albeit in a very low prevalence, warrants stricter sanitary measures and greater meat safety awareness in the general population to prevent meat-borne infections and potential transmission of drug-resistant bacteria to humans. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Adwin Ong; Chi-Lik Ken Lee							Cooperative metabolism in mixed culture solid-state fermentation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Okara and brewer's spent grain (BSG) are manufacturing side streams that contribute significantly to food waste. In this study, solid-state fermentation (SSF) was performed using okara and BSG as substrates to investigate the effects of fermentation using pure and Mixed culture s of Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis. The total phenolic content (TPC), crude protein content, and total dietary fibre (TDF) of the fermented substrates were determined to evaluate their nutritional profiles. Okara fermented with a Mixed culture under specific conditions produced the highest TPC values, and its TDF profile was the most ideal. These results reflected the presence of cooperative metabolism between Aspergillus oryzae and Bacillus subtilis which afforded greater enhancement in the nutritional profile of substrates compared to that of pure cultures. However, crude protein content could not be accurately determined, and more specific methods of protein quantification and optimisation of sample preparation for BSG in future work is recommended.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The rising demands and increasing health-conscious population in global beverages consumptions promote the development of new variety of kombucha beverages using various plant and fruits. This study aimed to isolate, identify and characterise the microorganisms found in the kombucha starter. Isolated microorganisms showed high similarity (99%) towards an acetic acids bacterium, Komagataeibacter rhaeticus MFS1 and a yeast, Dekkera bruxellensis MFS1. Under low pH tolerance test, D. bruxellensis MFS1 was remained viable (log7 CFU/mL) but no viable cell was observed for K. rhaeticus MFS1 after 3 h exposure at pH 2. However, both strains retained viability when exposed to pH 3-4 for 3 h. When tested bile salt tolerance at different concentration (0.3-1%), D. bruxellensis MFS1 showed high tolerance with viability up to log7 CFU/mL after 4 h exposure at 1% concentration. In contrast, K. rhaeticus MFS1 only retained the viability up to 2 h under bile salt environment. The presence of 1.45-1.62% acetic acid with less than 0.5% ethanol was detected at the end of 4-days fermentation in both kombucha papaya samples. These preliminary results showed the potential of using these isolated strains as starter cultures for the production of novel functional fermented beverages from papaya pulp and leaves.

Chitosan-enriched salicylic acid coatings preserves antioxidant properties and alleviates internal browning of pear fruit under cold storage and supermarket conditions.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Pear being climacteric in nature undergoes alterations in antioxidant properties during storage due to intense metabolic activities. In an attempt to maintain antioxidants level, pears were treated either with chitosan (CH) coatings alone (CH 1.0 and 2.0%) or were incorporated with 2.0 mM salicylic acid (SA) and stored for a period of 67 d under cold temperature (0-1 °C and 90-95% RH) and 20 d under supermarket conditions (20-22 °C and 80-85% RH). Evaluation study for different physico-chemical attributes of pears suggested that the SA loaded CH coatings restricted the climacteric peak and delayed the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzyme activity. As compared to control, these composite coatings promoted the preservation of total phenolics content (TPC), ascorbic acid (AsA) and retained higher total antioxidant activities (TAA) in fruit till 67 d of cold storage period and 20 d under supermarket conditions. Furthermore, CH 2.0% + SA 2.0 mM coatings strictly impeded the development of internal browning (IB) symptoms of pears throughout storage period. Combined coatings of CH plus SA contributed higher efficacy in terms of maintaining the functional properties of fruit as compared to individual coatings of CH or SA dip.

Evaluation of various starchy foods: a systematic review and meta-analysis on chemical properties affecting the glycemic index values based on in vitro and in vivo experiments.		Foods					The chemical properties that serve as major determinants for the glycemic index (GI) of starchy food and recommended low-GI, carbohydrate-based foods have remained enigmatic. This present work performed a systematic assessment of linkages between chemical properties of foods and GI, and selected low-GI starchy foods. The data were sourced from literature published in various scientific journals. In total, 57 relevant studies and 936 data points were integrated into a database. Both in vitro and in vivo studies on GI values were included. The database was subsequently subjected to a meta-analysis. Meta-analysis from in vitro studies revealed that the two significant factors responsible for the GI of starchy foods were resistant starch and phenolic content (respectively, standardized mean difference (SMD): -2.52, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -3.29 to -1.75, p (p-value) < 0.001; SMD: -0.72, 95%CI: -1.26 to -0.17, p=0.005), while the lowest-GI crop type was legumes. Subgroup analysis restricted to the crop species with significant low GI found two crops, i.e., sorghum (SMD: -0.69, 95%CI: -2.33 to 0.96, p< 0.001) and red kidney bean (SMD: -0.39, 95%CI: -2.37 to 1.59, p=0.001). Meta-analysis from in vivo studies revealed that the two significant factors responsible for the GI of starchy foods were flavonoid and phenolic content (respectively, SMD: -0.67, 95%CI: -0.87 to -0.47, p< 0.001; SMD: -0.63, 95%CI: -1.15 to -0.11, p=0.009), while the lowest-GI crop type was fruit (banana). In conclusion, resistant starch and phenolic content may have a desirable impact on the GI of starchy food, while sorghum and red kidney bean are found to have low GI. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, SERS coupled with chemometric algorithms like PLS (partial least square), Si-PLS (synergy interval-PLS), GA-PLS (genetic algorithm-PLS) and UVE-PLS (uninformative variable elimination-PLS) were applied for the detection of 2,4-D and imidacloprid in milk. The fabricated gold and silver core-shell nanoflowers (Au@Ag NFs) were used as SERS nanosensor which exhibited strong signal over the concentration range of 1.0*10-3 to 1.0*102 ng/mL. Performances of the models were evaluated based on the attained correlation coefficients of the prediction (Rp) and calibration (Rc), root mean square error in calibration (RMSECV) and prediction (RMSEP), and the ratio of sample standard deviation to RMSEP (RPD). The models exhibited improved results in the order of PLS < Si-PLS < GA-PLS < UVE-PLS. The UVE-PLS model showed superior performance, yielded Rc=0.9801 and Rp=0.9878 with RPD=6.32 for 2,4-D, and Rc=0.9732 and Rp=0.9726 with RPD=4.30 for imidacloprid. The strategy could be employed for safety and quality monitoring of milk. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	150				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.111978					FSTA:2021-12-Pe6502

Contamination of smoked fish and smoked-dried fish with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and biogenic amines and risk assessment for the Beninese consumers.		Food Control					The present study aims to assess the contamination of smoked and smoked-dried fish sampled on Beninese market with biogenic amines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Fifteen PAHs, ten biogenic amines and nineteen amino acids were analysed in thirty-six fish samples, using liquid chromatography techniques. The assessment of consumer exposure was carried out by calculating the estimated daily intake (EDI) which was compared to a toxicological reference value. The exposure to histamine, the most toxic biogenic amine, was calculated and compared with an acute reference dose (ARfD) of 50 mg/meal. The margin of exposure (MOE) to PAHs was calculated as the ratio between benchmark PAH levels and EDI. MOE to carcinogenic compounds below 10,000 indicates a potential concern for human health. Amino-acid profile varied as a function of fish species with a high content of histidine (the precursor of histamine) recorded in Cypselurus cyanopterus, the Atlantic flying fish (2.9 g/100 g, dry weight) followed by Scomber scombrus, the Atlantic mackerel (1.9 g/100 g, dry weight). High histamine concentration (4,384.2 mg/kg) was recorded in one sample of C. cyanopterus, a non-scombroid fish, exceeding 44 times the maximal limit of 100 mg/kg, set by the EU and Benin regulations. Histamine intake calculated using the maximum measured histamine concentration exceeded the ARfD. Concerning the PAH contamination, none of the smoked and smoked-dried fish samples were compliant with the EU regulation, and the MOE of the consumers were below 10,000 (for both median and maximum PAH contamination levels). In conclusion, the consumption of smoked and smoked-dried fish could represent a major concern for the Beninese consumer health because of both histamine and PAHs contamination.

A complementary food supplement from local food ingredients to enhance iron intake among children aged 6-59 months in Benin.		Food Science & Nutrition					Nutritious complementary feeding is often not affordable in Benin, and iron deficiency exists. This research aimed at formulating an affordable and sensory acceptable complementary food supplement using local food ingredients to increase iron intake among children aged 6-59 months in Benin. The complementary food supplement was formulated to ensure that 10 g would cover 25% of the estimated average requirements for iron for children aged 6 to 12 months. Adansonia digitata fruit pulp, Moringa oleifera leaf powder, and Cochlospermum tinctorium root powder were used to compose the complementary food supplement, which was mixed with maize and sorghum ogi porridges before being presented to the mothers and children for the acceptability test. The mineral contents of Adansonia digitata fruit pulp in mg/100 g dw were 9.9 0.1 for iron and 0.9 0.1 for zinc. The iron and zinc contents of Moringa oleifera leaf powder and Cochlospermum tinctorium root powder in mg/100 g dw were 34.1 2.2 and 26.8 2.7 and 9 0.0 and 0.9 0.0, respectively. The complementary food supplement contained, in mg/100 g dw, 17.4 1.1 of iron and 1.2 0.1 of zinc. The maize and sorghum ogi porridges enriched with the complementary food supplement at substitution rates of 15% and 16% (in dry weight), respectively, were acceptable to 85% of children for sorghum ogi porridge and 87% for maize ogi porridge. The present study demonstrated the potential of local food ingredients in the formulation of an iron-rich and acceptable complementary food supplement for children aged 6-59 months in Benin. © 2021 The Authors.

A comparative study: physical, mechanical and antibacterial properties of bio-composite gelatin films as influenced by chitosan and zinc oxide nanoparticles incorporation.		Food Bioscience					This study focuses on a comparison of bio-nanocomposites films with the addition of chitosan nanoparticles (organic) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (inorganic) in order to evaluate their affinity with bovine gelatin. The addition of organic and inorganic nanoparticles into gelatin/tapioca starch films were evaluated on its thickness, thermal, structure, barrier, mechanical and antibacterial properties. The addition of nanoparticles increased the film thickness. However, inorganic nanoparticle films showed more thermal stable compared to organic nanoparticle films. Moreover, the formation of Amide A, Amide I, and Amide II bands in the films structure, affecting the barrier properties of the film (p < 0.05). The incorporation of inorganic nanoparticles increased tensile strength (0.20-0.22 MPa) and decreased the elongation at breaks (131.80-94.55%) as well as film solubility. Furthermore, the gelatin-based bio-nanocomposite films showed antibacterial properties against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The inorganic nanoparticles had larger inhibition zone as compared to the organic nanoparticles. These findings indicate that inorganic nanoparticles have the potential to be incorporated with gelatin films to produce bio-nanocomposite films with better characteristics as food packaging.

Food Bioscience					The thermal stability and controlled release of Labisia pumila's polyphenols was increased using a surface protein encapsulated microcapsule. The polyphenols were measured using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography, whereas the degradation mechanism was elucidated using a mass spectroscopy analysis. The microencapsulation increased the polyphenols retention from 29.9 (without encapsulation) to 92.1% with spray drying. The mixture of gum Arabic and whey protein isolate 9:1 gave the best retention of gallic acid (95.2%), protocatechuic acid (91.2%), epigallocatechin (86.0%) and rutin (95.9%) with an average polyphenol retention of 92.1%. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis showed the formation of surface protein that acted as a protective layer, which increased the polyphenols stability. Decarboxylation was the primary degradation mechanism for gallic acid and protocatechuic acid, while rutin underwent hydrolysis. The degradation of epigallocatechin was due to deprotonation or dehydroxylation. The microcapsule with surface protein increased the overall polyphenols release with the simulated gastric and intestinal conditions by ~5% with an average release of 96.3%. The polyphenols release kinetics was analysed using Baker-Lonsdale, Korsmeyer, Higuchi, and Hixson-Crowell models. The release mechanism of the polyphenols best fit the Hixson-Crowell model indicating a surface erosion dependent release.

Biosynthesis of magnesium hydroxide nanomaterials using Monodora myristica, antioxidative activities and effect on disrupted glucose metabolism in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.		Food Bioscience					The anti-diabetic potentials of biosynthesized magnesium hydroxide nanoparticles using Monodora myristica (Mg (OH)2NP -Mm) seed extract was studied. Bioactive phytochemical constituents of M. myristica seeds were screened prior to synthesis. Characterization using UV, FTIR, SEM, TEM and EDX was carried out as well as in vitro antioxidant activities of the synthesized Mg (OH)2NP -Mm. Forty-eight adult male Wistar rats (150-250 g) were randomly grouped into 8 groups of 6 rats and diabetes induced with a low dose streptozotocin (ip, 55 mg/kg bw). Diabetic animals were administered 50,100, 150 and 200 mg/kg bw Mg (OH)2NP -Mm for 21 days with Mg (OH)2NP-STD (150 mg/kg bw) and glibenclamide (5 mg/kg bw) as control groups. However, characterization of Mg (OH)2NP -Mm showed light-scattering capacity (220-235 nm), functional groups (such as C-O, CC, C-H and alcoholic O-H), size (5-100 nm), a well-coordinated spherical shape and elemental composition: Mg-65.2, Si-6.42, C-28.7 and O-9.1%. Antioxidant evaluation showed total phenols (1.8 0.6 mg GAE/g), flavonoids (0.05 0.01 mg QE/g), total antioxidant (phosphomolybdenum reduction) (0.97 0.07 mg AAE/g), FRAP (0.89 0.23 mg AAE/g) OH-scavenging ability (IC50 = 36 2 mug/mL), as well as alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activities with IC50 of 0.17 0.01 and 0.18 0.01 mug/mL, respectively. Administration of Mg (OH)2NP -Mm led to a significant (p < 0.05) improvement in hematological indices, fasting blood glucose, serum insulin concentration, hepatic hexokinase activity and lactate dehydrogenase activity. These results suggested that biosynthesized Mg (OH)2NP -Mm could probably mitigate hyperglycemia by beta-cell protection and restoration of glycolytic enzyme activity.

Seasonal changes in the nutritional composition of Agarophyton vermiculophyllum (Rhodophyta, Gracilariales) from the center of Portugal.		Foods					Seaweeds exhibit high nutritional value due to a balanced concentration of proteins, vitamins and minerals, a high concentration of low digestibility polysaccharides, and reduced levels of lipids, many of which are n-3 and n-6 fatty acids. The species Agarophyton vermiculophyllum is no exception and, as such, a comprehensive study of the chemical and nutritional profile of this red seaweed was carried out for 1 year. Seasonal variations in moisture, ash, protein and amino acids content, crude fibers, ascorbic acid, agar, lipids, and the corresponding fatty acid profile, were analyzed. We found low levels of fatty acids and a high protein content, but also noticed interesting seasonal change patterns in these compounds. The present study gives insights on the environmental conditions that can lead to changes in the nutritional composition of this species, aiming, therefore, to bring new conclusions about the manipulation of environmental conditions that allow for maximizing the nutritional value of this seaweed. © 2021 by the authors.

Isolation and identification of natural colorant producing soil-borne Aspergillus niger from Bangladesh and extraction of the pigment.		Foods					Natural colorants have been used in several ways throughout human history, such as in food, dyes, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, and many other products. The study aimed to isolate the natural colorant-producing filamentous fungi Aspergillus niger from soil and extract pigments for its potential use specially for food production. Fourteen soil samples were collected from Madhupur National Park at Madhupur Upazila in the Mymensingh district, Bangladesh. The Aspergillus niger was isolated and identified from the soil samples by following conventional mycological methods (cultural and morphological characteristics), followed by confirmatory identification by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of conserved sequences of ITS1 ribosomal DNA using specific oligonucleotide primers. This was followed by genus-and species-specific primers targeting Aspergillus niger with an amplicon size of 521 and 310 bp, respectively. For pigment production, a mass culture of Aspergillus niger was conducted in Sabouraud dextrose broth in shaking conditions for seven days. The biomass was subjected to extraction of the pigments following an ethanol-based extraction method and concentrated using a rotary evaporator. Aspergillus niger could be isolated from three samples. The yield of extracted brown pigment from Aspergillus niger was 0.75% (w/ v). Spectroscopic analysis of the pigments was carried out using a UV-VIS spectrophotometer. An in vivo experiment was conducted with mice to assess the toxicity of the pigments. From the colorimetric and sensory evaluations, pigment-supplemented products (cookies and lemon juice) were found to be more acceptable than the control products. This could be the first attempt to use Aspergillus niger extracted pigment from soil samples in food products in Bangladesh, but for successful food production, the food colorants must be approved by a responsible authority, e.g., the FDA or the BSTI. Moreover, fungal pigments could be used in the emerging fields of the food and textile industries in Bangladesh. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Afsaneh Alishahi; Mohammad-Taghi Golmakani; Mehrdad Niakousari							Feasibility study of microwave-assisted biodiesel production from vegetable oil refinery waste.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					Vegetable oil refinery waste containing acid oil is used as an inexpensive feedstock for producing biodiesel by microwave-assisted esterification (MAE) method. Effects of some main variables such as free fatty acid: methanol molar ratio (1:1, 1:5, and 1:10), reaction time (5,30, and 60 min), and catalyst concentration (1%, 2%, and 3%) on physicochemical properties of produced biodiesel are investigated. Optimum reaction conditions of MAE are free fatty acid: methanol molar ratio of 1:10, reaction time of 60 min, and a catalyst concentration of 3%, while having 95.79% conversion yield. By increasing the conversion yield of the biodiesel, density and color brightness increase, while viscosity and refractive index decrease. There are no significant differences between physicochemical and heating properties of biodiesel produced by MAE and magnetic stirrer esterification (MSE) methods. Meanwhile, energy consumption of MAE method is almost four times lower than that of MSE. MAE as a promising alternative to the conventional esterification method can be considered as an energy-efficient method for producing biodiesel from inexpensive vegetable oil refinery waste. Practical applications: Acid oil is an inexpensive by-product of alkali refining in vegetable oil plants that would pollute the environment if not rendered safely. In this study, MAE is used to convert acid oil to biodiesel as a practical process for bringing alkali refining waste into production cycle. Acid oil can provide a reduction in the cost of biodiesel production. In addition, application of energy-efficient MAE method can facilitate the economical production of biodiesel. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	9			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000377					FSTA:2022-01-Ne0010
J		Afshar Mehrabi, F.; Akram Sharifi; Maryam Ahvazi							Effect of chitosan coating containing Nepeta pogonosperma extract on shelf life of chicken fillets during chilled storage.		Food Science & Nutrition					Chicken meat is highly susceptible to microbial and chemical spoilage due to its high moisture and protein content. The use of edible coatings contains herbal extracts with antioxidant and antibacterial properties that help to extend the shelf life of meat products. In this study, the effect of chitosan coating (2%) and Nepeta pogonosperma extract (NPe) (0.2% and 0.6%) and their combination on chemical properties (pH, peroxide value (PV), thiobarbituric acid index (TBARS), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N)) and microbial (aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic microorganisms, lactic acid bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas sp.) of chicken fillets were studied over a 12-day refrigerated storage period compared to the control sample. The results of NPe DPPH radical scavenging activity (DRSA) showed that IC50 and total phenolic contents values were 94.65 mug/ml and 113.53 mg GAE/g extract, respectively. Statistical results showed that the rate of increase in pH, PV, TBARS, and TVB-N of all coated treatments were lower than control. Microbial analysis results showed a decrease in the growth of different bacteria in chitosan-treated combined with NPe compared to the control sample during chilled storage. Chicken fillets coated with chitosan and 0.6% NPe displayed a longer shelf life compared to other samples. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Afshari, R.; Pillidge, C. J.; Dias, D. A.; Osborn, A. M.; Gill, H.							Biomarkers associated with cheese quality uncovered by integrative multi-omic analysis.		Food Control					Cheese quality is determined by many dynamic complex interactions that occur between cheese microbiota, metabolites and milk substrates. Here we report that application of multi-omics and data integration (by Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent components, DIABLO) is able to identify and rank biomarkers (taxa and metabolites) which could discriminate, at the molecular level, cheddar cheeses of different quality made by the same manufacturer and to the same specifications. Samples of high-quality mature cheddar had higher amounts of proline, histidine, isoleucine and aspartic acid but lower amounts of stearic acid and octadecanol relative to the lower-quality cheddar. Furthermore, Streptococcus species (presumably S. thermophilus) were present in higher abundance relative to Lactococcus lactis in the higher-quality cheddar. Integrative analysis also revealed significant relationships between these multi-omics biomarkers. Together these results highlight the potential for this approach for identifying biomarkers that could be used to discriminate cheeses of varying quality and as a complementary approach to the current manual sensory evaluation of cheese.

Food Chemistry					Sodium metabisulfite (SMB), an antioxidant agent, is extensively used as a preservative in food industry. The current study was aimed to clarify its potential toxic effects on human fetal foreskin fibroblasts (HFFF2) cells, in vitro. Subsequently, MTT results illustrated that exposure to SMB significantly (p < 0.0001) decreased HFFF2 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner, and the concentration of 25 muM reduced cell survival rates to 50% as the half-maximal inhibitory concentration of SMB. It was further shown that SMB exerted this cytotoxic effect on HFFF2 cells through apoptosis induction. qRT-PCR and western blotting results showed that treatment of HFFF2 cells with this food additive led to significant upregulation of Bax, caspase 8, and caspase 9 pro-apoptotic genes and downregulation of Bcl-2 expression as a pro-survival agent. Furthermore, SMB remarkably increased caspase 3 levels and promoted its activation through cleavage in treated cells. Besides, exposure to SMB increased ROS levels and activated autophagy in treated cells, which are considered as the other indicators for cell damage. Taken together, our findings suggested that SMB could exert remarkable toxic effects on human normal cells through multiple mechanisms, including apoptosis activation, and its widespread usage in food safety should be reconsidered.

J		Afshin Selahvarzi; Yousef Ramezan; Reza Sanjabi, M.; Hossein Mirsaeedghazi; Fatemeh Azarikia; Ahmadreza Abedinia							Investigation of antimicrobial activity of orange and pomegranate peels extracts and their use as a natural preservative in a functional beverage.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of orange peel extract (OPE) and pomegranate peel extract (PPE) as natural preservatives on the characteristics of a functional drink (FB). These FBs were produced using fruit concentrates and agricultural waste (melon seed and tea stalk caffeine) as well as malt extract and powder. First, OPE's and PPE's antimicrobial activity (AMA) was tested in vitro on two pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli). Then their effects were investigated on the FBs' quality. Although both extracts showed significant AMA against bacteria, it was higher in OPE than PPE sample (p<0.05). The results show that the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for PPE samples was 1.5 and 2.5 times that of OPA against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Increasing the levels of extracts in beverages, especially OPE, can reduce the pH during 27-day in refrigeration storage and also significantly reduce the growth of total bacterial, molds, and yeasts. Adding the PPE reduced sensory scores, while OPE had no adverse effect on sensory characteristics. Samples containing PPE showed approximately 25% higher antioxidant activity and 45% higher total phenolic content (mg Gallic acid/g extract) than OPE samples. The sample containing 15% OPE was introduced as the best natural preservative to improve the functional beverage's quality and shelf life. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5683	5694	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01141-z					FSTA:2022-07-Hq6475

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					A functional energy drink (FED) was prepared based on the agricultural wastes of melon seed powder (MSP) (1% and 3%) and tea stalk caffeine (TSC) (160 and 320 ppm). The beverages' physicochemical, functional, sensory, antimicrobial, and nutritional properties were measured. Results showed that increasing MSP levels increased beverage calories by 23% and beverage fiber by 53.3%. Combinations of 320 ppm of TSC with both MSP levels could show better antimicrobial properties against undesirable gram-positive bacteria. Comparison of the best FED produced in this study with two popular brands in the market showed the superiority of functional, nutritional, and safety characteristics of FEDs. The total phenolic compounds (TPC) and antioxidant capacity in the best drink produced were 1.56 mg gallic acid/mg and 48.72%, respectively. The sensory properties increased by increasing MSP and TSC, indicating good overall acceptance. In general, by MSP and TSC addition, a desirable FED can be achieved. Practical applications. The food processing industry, along with increased awareness of nutrition among consumers, is completing a cheaper source of nutrients to finally become functional foods. Our results showed that the appropriate combination of agricultural waste to produce a FED has better quality and activity compared to those on the market. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15726					FSTA:2022-01-Hr0109
J		Agarbati, A.; Marini, E.; Galli, E.; Canonico, L.; Ciani, M.; Comitini, F.							Characterization of wild yeasts isolated from artisan dairies in the Marche region, Italy, for selection of promising functional starters.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Ninety-two yeasts isolated from cheeses and different dairies in the Marche region (Italy) were identified and characterized as potential functional co-starter cultures. The prevalent isolates were Debaryomyces hansenii (58%), Candida zeylanoides (25%) and Yarrowia lipolytica (5.5%), while other species belonging to the Candida, Kluyveromyces, Moniliella and Yamadazyma genera were minorities. The yeasts identified were subjected to typing analysis with the purpose of clustering the biotypes to detect the strain specificity for each dairy. Furthermore, the occurrence of some functional and/or probiotic properties was evaluated. D. hansenii, C. zeylanoides and Y. lipolytica showed 16,4 and 2 different biotypes, respectively. Y. lipol y tica biotype II and Candida parapsilosis biotype I exhibited high antioxidant activities. The unique Kluyveromyces lactis biotype showed a minimal ability to grow in the presence of bile salts at 37 °C and pH 2.5, but it exhibited high antioxidant activity. Most of the D. hansenii and C. zeylanoides biotypes showed relevant preliminary probiotic and technological traits. Thus, considering these preliminary evaluations, selected strains of C. zeylanoides, Y. lipol y tica and K. lactis could be proposed in association with lactic acid bacteria as innovative co-starters that are able to develop functional cheeses characterized by a distinctive aroma.

J		Agbemavor, W. S. K.; Buys, E. M.							Presumptive probiotic bacteria from traditionally fermented African food challenge the adhesion of enteroaggregative E. coli.		Journal of Food Safety					Colonization of intestinal tract with the potential to exclude, displace, and inhibit enteric pathogens is principally dependent on the adhesion ability of probiotics. Therefore, probiotic efficacy is considered to be mainly determined by their adhesion ability. The current study reports the antagonistic effect of four lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on the adhesion profile of four diarrhoeagenic and one non-diarrhoeagenic enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC). All the bacterial strains investigated adhered to the Caco-2 cells. All the LAB tested competitively excluded, displaced, and inhibited at least three (non-) diarrhoeagenic EAEC strains from adhesion (p< 0.05). In all, Lactobacillus plantarum, FS2 exhibited the strongest adhesion to the Caco-2 cells, competitive exclusion (CE), displacement, and inhibition against most of the EAEC strains. Additionally, the competence to exclude, displace, and inhibit the EAEC from adhesion depended on both the pathogens and the LAB strains tested; signifying the participation of several mechanisms. Contrary to all the EAEC strains, gastro-intestinal stress factors such as low pH (2.5) had no effect on the adhesion of the LAB. Unlike the gastro-intestinal acidic conditions, bile salt conditioning (at pH 6.5) had no effect on the adhesion of both EAEC and LAB. In conclusion, all the LAB tested showed specific anti-adherence effects including CE, displacement, and inhibition against the selected EAEC. The results indicate that all the LAB, particularly, the L. plantarum, FS2 had a good ability for exerting antagonistic effects against the selected EAEC for the prevention of gastrointestinal infection. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Fish are highly perishable foods due to their high body water and neutral pH and spoil faster than other meat foods. In this study, the effect of coating of salep gum containing concentrations of zero, 0.25% and 0.5% of orange peel essential oil in preventing the growth of microbial flora and chemical spoilage and increasing the shelf life of fish fillets in the refrigerator during 16 days of storage was investigated. The results showed that during storage, the number of total aerobic mesophilic, psychrophilic, coliforms and lactic acid bacteria, pH, total volatile base nitrogen, peroxide value, and thiobarbituric acid increased significantly in all treatments, that was less in treatments coated by salep containing orange peel essential oil (p< .01). Based on our findings, the shelf life of fillets can be increased to at least 12 days by coating them with the salep containing 0.5% orange peel essential oil. Practical applications. In the last decade, the consumption of fish is increasing due to its health benefits. However, fish are highly susceptible to microbial contamination. The use of edible coatings with antimicrobial and antioxidant compounds is an effective way to maintain the quality of fish. Based on our findings, the shelf life of fillets can be increased to at least 8 and 12 days by coating them with the salep containing 0.25% and 0.5% orange peel essential oil, respectively. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15737					FSTA:2022-01-Rc0044
J		Agga, G. E.; Silva, P. J.; Martin, R. S.							Detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant bacteria from mink feces and feed in the United States.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Antibiotic-resistant infections caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases are increasing worldwide. Bacteria resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins and last resort carbapenems have been reported from food animals and their environments. Other concentrated nonfood-producing animals such as mink farming can be a reservoir of bacteria resistant to these critically important antibiotics. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of ESBL-producing bacteria and carbapenem-resistant (CR) bacteria from mink fecal (n=42) and feed (n=8) samples obtained from a commercial mink farm in the United States. The most prevalent ESBL-producing bacteria identified from the fecal samples were Escherichia coli (93%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (76%), and Proteus species (88%). E. coli (100%) and K. pneumoniae (75%) were also the most prevalent ESBL-producing bacteria identified from feed samples. All ESBL E. coli isolates were resistant to penicillin and most cephem beta-lactam antibiotics. Among the ESBL E. coli isolates, co-resistance was observed to ciprofloxacin (33%) and gentamicin (28%) indicating multidrug resistance. ESBL E. coli isolates predominantly carried blaCTX-M-14 and blaCTX-M-15 genes. Although all feed K. pneumoniae isolates carried blaCTX-M-9, all fecal K. pneumoniae isolates carried blaSHV. CR Pseudomonas species (7%), Hafnia alvei (24%), and Myroides odoratimimus (9.5%) were detected from fecal samples. H. alvei (37.5%) was the only CR bacteria detected from the feed samples. All CR isolates were polymerase chain reaction negative for the tested carbapenemases that are commonly reported, which may indicate intrinsic rather than acquired resistance. This study indicates that mink production can be a reservoir for bacteria resistant to the highest priority critically important antibiotics for human health.

Buttermilk as encapsulating agent: effect of ultra-high-pressure homogenization on chia oil-in-water liquid emulsion formulations for spray drying.		Foods					Functional foods are highly demanded by consumers. Omega-3 rich oil and commercial buttermilk (BM), as functional components, used in combination to produce emulsions for further drying may facilitate the incorporation to foods. Ultra-high-pressure homogenization (UHPH) has a great potential for technological and nutritional aspects in emulsions production. The present study aimed to examine the potential improvement of UHPH technology in producing buttermilk-stabilized omega-3 rich emulsions (BME) for further drying, compared with conventional homogenization. Oil-in-water emulsions formulated with 10% chia: sunflower oil (50:50); 30% maltodextrin and 4 to 7% buttermilk were obtained by using conventional homogenization at 30 MPa and UHPH at 100 and 200 MPa. Particle size analysis, rheological evaluation, colloidal stability, zeta-potential measurement, and microstructure observations were performed in the BME. Subsequent spray drying of emulsions were made. As preliminary approximation for evaluating differences in the homogenization technology applied, encapsulation efficiency and morphological characteristics of on spray-dried emulsions (SDE) containing 21.3 to 22.7% oil content (dry basis) were selected. This study addresses the improvement in stability of BME treated by UHPH when compared to conventional homogenization and the beneficial consequences in encapsulation efficiency and morphology of SDE. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Diazinon is the most important pesticide of sweet cherry and one possible tactic to detect its residues is sensing the aromatic volatiles released by fruit with using electronic-nose. Electronic-nose (e-nose) machines are designed to detect the diazinon residue in sweet cherries. It was equipped with ten sensors (MOS type), that each of them reacts to specific volatile compounds in the samples. The mathematical method to analyze the results in this paper are artificial neural networks (ANN), principal components analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA). PCA analysis characterized 90-96% of the variance in data for toxic and non-toxic sweet cherries in four ripeness grades (RGs). The best structure (10-4-2) can classify the samples in two classes (toxic and non-toxic) in ANN analysis with a precision of 100%. The accuracy of the LDA analysis for detection diazinon residue was 97%. Sensors TGS813, RGS822, TGS2602, and MQ3 showed the best response for detection of diazinon. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1213	1224	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00724-6					FSTA:2021-10-Jd13764
J		Agirbas, H. E. T.; Yavuz-Duzgun, M.; Ozcelik, B.							The effect of fruit seed flours on Farinograph characteristics of composite dough and shelf life of cake products.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this study was to assess the potential of different seed flours for cake making and to determine the effect of substitution of wheat with the seed flours on dough rheology and shelf life of the cakes. Composite flours were produced by substituting wheat flour with graded levels (5%, 10%, and 15%) of apricot seed flour (ASF), sour cherry seed flour (CSF), pomegranate seed flour (POSF), and pumpkin seed flour (PUSF). Farinograph was used to determine the effect of seed flour substitution on techno-functional attributes of wheat flour. Cake batter samples were characterized in terms of pH, density, viscosity, and volume of cakes. The shelf life of cake samples was monitored using quality parameters such as moisture, water activity, hardness, and elasticity. Correlation between farinograph characteristics and cake properties were also analyzed. Farinograph characteristics showed that dough prepared with seed flours have higher stability with lower softening degrees. PH and density of batter were not significantly (p>0.05) affected, while viscosity varied significantly (p<0.05) due to the type and substitution level of seed flour. The cakes substituted with PUSF had the lowest volume while the other seed flours did not cause a statistically significant (p>0.05) change. Throughout the storage period, water activity and moisture loss of cakes substituted with the seed flours did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from the control (100% wheat cake). Texture analysis showed that softer cakes were produced with seed flour substitutions especially when CSF was used. The increase in firmness and elasticity loss was lower in substituted cakes compared to control. The results could have important implications for the valorization of seed flours to produce functional baked products with high protein content. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	3973	3984	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00961-3					FSTA:2022-01-Mq0402

In the present study, the image analysis of stones of six main Greek protected designation of origin (PDO) table olive varieties was performed for the control of their authentication and discrimination, with cv. Prasines Chalkidikis, cv. Kalamata Olive, cv. Konservolia Stylidas, cv. Konservolia Amfissis, cv. Throuba Thassos and cv. Throuba Chios being the studied olive varieties. Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used for discrimination and classification of the six Greek table olive varieties. With a 98.33% of varietal discrimination, the OPLS-DA model proved to be an efficient tool to authentify table olive varieties from their morphological characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Agu, H. O.; Yunana, R.; Jideani, A. I. O.							Development and acceptability of snacks from yellow-fleshed sweet potato and wheat flours.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Composite flour from YFSP and wheat flours were utilized for the production of biscuit, cake, and chin-chin snacks. For each snack-type, five samples in the ratio 20:80, 40:60, 60:40, 80:40, and 100:0 of YFSP and wheat flours, respectively, were produced. Sensory evaluation and proximate composition of the snacks were determined. The sensory evaluation showed that 20:80, 40:60, and 20:80% YFSP/wheat flour cakes, biscuits, and chin-chin, respectively, compared favorably in all the sensory attributes with the control sample (100% wheat flour cake). The proximate composition (%) of the 100:0 of YFSP/wheat flour snacks ranged from 2.99 to 12.06 moisture, 5.16 to 10.88 protein, 11.93 to 20.91 fat, 2.86 to 3.87 ash, 1.65 to 4.15 crude fiber, and 50.48 to 72.88 carbohydrate. The 100:0 ratio of YFSP/wheat flour biscuit, cake, and chin-chin had the highest energy contents (kcal/100 g). The study further enhances the strengths of YFSP in new product formulation for the snacks food industry. Practical application. The possibility of producing snacks from yellow-fleshed sweet potato (YFSP) and wheat flours, especially where the conventional flour is not financially feasible. The optimized process can be used for commercial production of these snacks (cake, biscuit, and chin-chin) from YFSP for nutritional, health benefits, food security, and economic impact. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aguayo-Mendoza, M. G.; Chatonidi, G.; Piqueras-Fiszman, B.; Stieger, M.							Linking oral processing behavior to bolus properties and dynamic sensory perception of processed cheeses with bell pepper pieces.		Food Quality and Preference					The addition of food particles to food matrices is a convenient approach that allows to steer oral behavior, sensory perception and satiation. The aim of this study was to determine the influence of physical-chemical properties of heterogenous foods on oral processing behavior, bolus properties and dynamic sensory perception. Bell pepper gel pieces varying in fracture stress and concentration were added to processed cream cheese matrices differing in texture. Addition of bell pepper gel pieces to processed cheeses increased consumption time, decreased eating rate and led to harder and less adhesive bolus with more saliva incorporated. Addition of bell pepper gel pieces to processed cheeses decreased dominance rate and duration of creaminess, smoothness, melting and dairy flavor and increased graininess and bell pepper flavor. Increasing fracture stress of bell pepper gel pieces from 100 to 300 kPa resulted in longer consumption time and lower eating rate. For hard/non-adhesive processed cheese matrices increasing gel pieces fracture stress lead to a boli with larger particles and more saliva. These changes were accompanied by decreased dominance perception of creaminess and bell pepper flavor and increased dominance of graininess. Increasing the concentration of bell pepper gel pieces from 15 to 30% did not affect oral behavior but led to the formation of harder and less adhesive bolus with larger particles and less saliva that were perceived with reduced dominance of creaminess, meltiness and dairy flavor while dominance of graininess and bell pepper flavor increased. Changing the texture of the cheese matrix from soft/adhesive to hard/non-adhesive decreased consumption time, increased eating rate, did not influence bolus properties and decreased dominance rate of creaminess, smoothness and melting sensations. Number of chews and total consumption time were positively correlated with saliva content of the bolus, number of bolus particles, bolus hardness, dominance of firmness, chewiness and graininess. We conclude that the modification of physical-chemical properties of processed cheeses and embedded bell pepper gel pieces can be a strategy to steer oral behavior and bolus properties which consequently determine dynamic sensory perception.

J		Agudelo, A.; Carvajal, M.; Martinez-Ballesta, M. del C.							Halophytes of the Mediterranean basin-underutilized species with the potential to be nutritious crops in the scenario of the climate change.		Foods					Halophyte plants are adapted to saline environments and represent a novel type of crops given their possible uses at both culinary and industrial levels. In this work, the nutritional quality of different Mediterranean halophyte species, Atriplex halimus, Salicornia fruticosa, and Cakile maritima, was evaluated under conditions of high salinity. For this, plants were grown at different NaCl concentrations (0, 100, 200, and 300 mM) and the contents of proteins, total lipids, polyphenols, and mineral elements were analyzed as well as growth. Of the three species, C. maritima was the most sensitive to salt stress and therefore showed the highest phenolic compounds content. By contrast, whereas salinity increased the amounts of proteins and phenolics with respect to the control in A. halimus and S. fruticosa, it decreased them in C. maritima. Plants of A. halimus accumulated higher amounts of Na+ in their leaves, but the level of this ion, considering human consumption, was below that of other culinary halophyte species. In conclusion, all the results indicate that these three halophyte species grown at high salt levels represent optimal crops for-new foodstuff-production as green salt or spice due to their nutritional potential. © 2021 by the authors.

Determination of mechanical properties of whey protein films during accelerated aging: application of FTIR profiles and chemometric tools.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Nowadays, the application of non-destructive techniques in food engineering is arising. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) combined with chemometric tools show potential in evaluation of food materials. The aim of this work was to determine the applicability of FTIR profiles and chemometric tools to predict the mechanical properties of whey protein-based film (WPF). A WPF solution was prepared using whey protein concentrate/distilled-water/glycerol in (10/85/5% wt/wt) respectively. Then, the films were aged at 30 °C/5days and 60% RH. Each day, 10 pieces were evaluated, obtaining their FTIR profiles (4000-650cm-1), tensile strength (TS), elongation at break (EB), and elastic modulus (EM). Principal component analysis-multilinear regression (PCA-MLR) and partial least square regression (PLSR) were developed using the K-fold cross-validation technique. For EB and EM, the coefficient of correlation (R2) and root means squared error (RMSE) were above 0.8990 and under 0.5250 (Full PLSR) and 0.8730 and 0.1378 (Optimized PLSR), unlike to TS presented R2 and RMSE values lower than 0.2160 and 2.5247, similar to PCA-MLR models with values lower than 0.2050 and 0.1889, respectively (for all variables). In this sense, the use of FTIR profiles coupled to chemometric tools could be adequate to predict some properties in WPFs during aging. Practical applications. This research presents a practical way for mechanical properties evaluation in films by means of Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) coupled to chemometric tools. This new method could be useful for rapid monitoring of textural properties and characterization of films for food packaging. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Influence of type of natural emulsifier and microfluidization conditions on Capsicum oleoresin nanoemulsions properties and stability.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					There is a growing interest in the fabrication of colloidal delivery systems for bioactive compounds assembled from natural ingredients, particularly plant-based ones. In this study, Capsicum oleoresin was encapsulated within oil-in-water nanoemulsions by high-pressure microfluidization from natural emulsifiers: whey protein (WP), pea protein (PP), quillaja saponin (QS), and sunflower lecithin (SL). The influence of emulsifier, concentration, and microfluidization conditions (pressure and number of passes), on particle diameter and zeta-potential of nanoemulsions was evaluated. Particle diameter decreased with increasing homogenization pressure and number of passes. All emulsifiers were capable of forming charged droplets with dimensions in the nanometer range at sufficiently high concentrations. The stability of nanoemulsions to environmental stresses (pH, ionic strength, and heating) and storage was studied. The pH and salt stabilities were dependent on the emulsifier type. Overall, natural emulsifiers were effective in producing Capsicum oleoresin-loaded nanoemulsions with small particle size and capsaicin stability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	4			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13660					FSTA:2021-08-Te2934
J		Aguiar, D.; Pereira, A. C.; Marques, J. C.							Agricultural Rum of Madeira matured on the seafloor: improved physicochemical changes induced by a pioneering seafloor ageing process.		European Food Research and Technology					The unique agricultural rum produced in Europe, Agricultural Rum of Madeira, is obtained from alcoholic fermentation and distillation of sugarcane juice, followed by cask ageing for a minimum of 3 years. For the first time, the impact of underwater bottle ageing on the maturation of this type of spirit was studied. Herein, the physicochemical properties of samples of Agricultural Rum of Madeira bottle-aged in a cellar and after 7 and 14 months on the seafloor were compared. The results revealed significant and positive changes in the organoleptic properties of the rum after 14 months of ageing on the seafloor. It was found that underwater ageing does not lead to the loss of the specific polyphenols of the cask-ageing stage (non-flavonoids, 43.53 mg/L after 14 months on the seafloor) and increases the flavonoids composition (6.88 to 21.09 mg/L after 14 months). While the acidity increased slightly, the volatile composition of the primary aromas resulting from sugarcane (terpenoids) was unchanged. Esters represented about 85% of the volatile compounds in the bottled sugarcane spirit after ageing in casks and higher concentration (increase of about 23%) were detected after underwater ageing. This study also revealed that 14 months of underwater ageing promoted a colour change to darker tones, with values close to those detected by the human eye (DeltaE of 2.47). The principal component analysis highlighted the meaningful changes after 14 months on seafloor conditions, without any chemical family standing out as the most important. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.		; Pereira, Ana Cristina/A-7681-2015; Marques, Jose C/F-3014-2010	Aguiar, Dayana/0000-0002-3527-447X; Pereira, Ana Cristina/0000-0003-3097-7704; Marques, Jose C/0000-0002-4832-4341							2021	247	12	3023	3035	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03855-2					FSTA:2022-03-Hl1651

Influence of pseudocereals on gluten-free bread quality: a study integrating dough rheology, bread physical properties and acceptability.		Food Research International					This study describes the use of the Mixture Design for simultaneals to improve the physical properties and acceptability of gluten-free bread (GFB) based on whole pseudocereals flour, as well as to define dough and bread instrumental predictors of the sensory quality of GFB. Three simplex-centroid designs were used to study the effects of each pseudocereal flour (amaranth-AF, buckwheat-BF, and quinoa-QF) blended with rice flour (RF) and potato starch (PS) on dough and bread properties. A total of 30 GFB formulations were produced and evaluated. Results. Reveal relationships between dough Mixolab parameters, such as C3 and C4, related to gelatinization and starch stability, with crumb moisture and firmness of GFB formulation, in which higher values of these parameters related to higher acceptability scores (>7 on a 10 cm hydroid hedonic scale). However, higher values of the secondary parameter C3-C4 was related to lower loaf-specific volume, impairing appearance and texture acceptability, as well as overall liking. The interaction effects between pseudocereal flour and RF increases dough consistency, bread volume, softness, and acceptability. Blends of 50% AF, BF, or QF with 50% RF results in GFB with high acceptability (overall liking of 8). The maximum pseudocereal proportions to obtain acceptable GFB (scores≥7 for appearance, color, odor, texture, flavor acceptability and overall liking) were 60% AF, 85% BF, and 82% QF blended with RF. The combination of instrumental and sensory methods was useful to identify parameters capable of predicting the GFB quality, which may be useful for food scientists and producers to face the challenges regarding the development of healthier and better quality GFB to meet consumer needs.

The variety, roasting, processing, and type of cultivation determine the low OTA levels of commercialized coffee in Chiapas State, Mexico.		Food Control					Ochratoxin A (OTA) in coffee is associated with serious health problems and significant economic loss. The state of Chiapas is the top coffee producer in Mexico, accounting for 41.3% of the national production, and the second largest organic coffee-producing area worldwide. Due to the lack of information about the OTA content in Chiapas coffee, 100 coffee samples from Chiapas were collected and classified according to their variety, type (roasted or nonroasted), processing and cultivation, in the 2017/2018 cycle. The average OTA concentration in 97 of the analyzed samples was 0.41 mug/kg. OTA was not detected in 52% of the samples; in 45% of the samples, the concentration ranged between 0.05 and 3.4 mug/kg, below the limit of European regulations (<5 mug/kg), and in only 3% of the samples did the OTA values exceed the European regulations. The statistical analysis revealed that the prevalence of OTA depends on the variety, type, and processing (p ≤ 0.05). No significant differences were observed between organic and conventionally cultivated coffee. In instant coffee (produced domestically), the average OTA concentration in 14 samples was 0.93 mug/kg. The probability of finding OTA in instant coffee is higher than that in Chiapas coffee. These results suggest that the prevalence of OTA in coffee from Chiapas is low and that it is less likely to be found in wet-processed, roasted, arabica coffee.

Metabolites, volatile compounds and in vitro functional properties during growth and commercial harvest of Peruvian lucuma (Pouteria lucuma).		Food Bioscience					The objective of this work was to identify primary and secondary metabolites, volatile compounds, bioactive properties and physicochemical characteristics of lucuma fruit at two ripeness stages, before physiological maturity (bPM) and at physiological maturity (PM) or commercial harvest. The content of reducing sugars decreased, while starch content increased. Myo-inositol and vitamin C content decreased and increased, respectively as maturity stage advanced. The content of stearic acid decreased possibly related to the formation of unsaturated fatty acids and volatile compounds, especially aldehydes, such as 2-hexenal. In fact, key identified volatile compounds included 2-hexenal and hexanoic acid. Regarding secondary metabolites and functional properties, these significantly decreased as maturity stage advanced, only the total carotenoid content significantly increased (0.083-0.148 mg beta-carotene equivalent); and the total phenolic content (83.3 69.3 mg GAE/g dw), sterols (4.4-6.5 mug beta-sitosterol/g dw, 0.74-0.86 mug cycloartenol/g dw) and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity were not influenced by the maturity stage. The presence of alpha-amyrin (25.4 mug/g dw), myo-inositol (3.17 mg/g dw) and alpha-tocopherol (5.1 mg/100 g dw) stood out, so lucuma fruit could have potential as food with antioxidant, hypolipidemic, anti-hyperglycemic, and anti-inflammatory properties.

Foods					The Spanish Mediterranean region concentrates the largest producers of lemons (Citrus limon Burm. F.) at the national level where the 98.4% of the cultivated area of lemons corresponds to the varieties "Verna" and "Fino". In this study, the morphological and chemical variations of the fruits obtained in five variety/rootstock combinations were investigated in order to determine the influence and impact of the rootstock on the physicochemical properties of the fruits. The assay was carried out using three lemon varieties ("Fino 95", "Fino 49" and "Verna") grafted onto two different rootstocks (Citrus macrophylla and Citrus aurantium). The varieties were selected due to be consolidated commercial varieties, while the rootstocks are the most commonly used in the world. Both the morphological characteristics of the fruits (colour, weight, size) as well as their physicochemical characteristics (total soluble solids, titratable acidity, maturity index, antioxidant activity, sugars, and organic acids) were evaluated. Based on the results, the lemons with the best physicochemical and the best compositional characteristics were obtained in the "Fino 95" and "Fino 49" lemons grafted onto C. aurantium rootstock presented the highest quality fruits. © 2020 by the authors.

Manosonication-assisted extraction of trans-astaxanthin from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous: a green and organic solvent-free methodology.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Manosonication process's potential for astaxanthin extraction from fresh biomass of Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous ATCC 74219 in an aqueous medium has been demonstrated. The efficacy of manosonication to extract the lipid-soluble astaxanthin was attributed to the ultrasound's capability to break the cells and form a monodisperse and stable emulsion using phospholipids and proteins extracted from cell membrane during treatments as emulsifiers. Carotenoid extraction was affected by external pressure, vibration amplitude, and treatment time. Parameters affecting the carotenoid extraction were analyzed and optimized using Response Surface Methodology via Box-Behnken design. Under optimum conditions (96 mum of amplitude, 200 kPa of external pressure, and 90 s), 72% of extractability was achieved, with 2.47 mg/gdw of trans-astaxanthin and 2.88 mg/gdw of total carotenoids, in a corresponding ratio of astaxanthin to total carotenoids of 85.7%. The carotenoids extractability was linearly related to the specific energy independently of the external pressure and vibration amplitude applied, representing a positive aspect of the process's future scale-up. This research proposes an efficient, solvent-free, and eco-friendly process for the extraction of astaxanthin. The designed process also represents an alternative to enhance astaxanthin's bioavailability and enables its use as a high-value bio-pigment in the food, feed, aquaculture, cosmetic, nutraceutical, and pharmaceutical industries.

Optimization of microwave assisted extraction of Artocarpus heterophyllus leaf polyphenols with inhibitory action against Alternaria sp. and antioxidant capacity.		Food Science and Biotechnology					The Artocarpus heterophyllus extracts are receiving attention due to their agro-food applications. Then, the simultaneous optimization of microwave-assisted extraction of polyphenols from jackfruit leaf with growth inhibitory action against Alternaria sp. was studied. The effects of power and time on total soluble polyphenols and total flavonoids contents, and antifungal activity were investigated using response surface methodology. Temperature behavior was considered also. Models showed good prediction and successfully validation. Treatment at 840 W and 2 min allowed the responses maximization (148.75 mg galic acid equivalent /g dried weight of total soluble polyphenols, 13.28 mg rutin equivalent /g dried weight of total flavonoids, and 39.9% of antifungal activity). Furthermore, high ABTS+ (97%) and DPPH (92%) inhibition was exhibited, as a function of the polyphenol's concentration and composition. Mainly flavonoids with potential antioxidant and antifungal properties were detected. These findings suggest the potentialities of these extracts for Alternaria sp. control during tomato postharvest. ©The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.

Improvement in lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects consuming ice creams with high or low concentrations of Bifidobacterium bifidum 900791.		Foods					Although Bifidobacterium bifidum expresses lactase activity, no clinical trials have determined its impact on lactose-intolerant subjects. This study evaluated whether acute and chronic ingestion of ice creams containing B. bifidum 900791 at high (107 CFU/g) or low (105 CFU/g) concentrations improved lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. Fifty subjects were selected based on a positive lactose (20 g) hydrogen breath test (HBT0) and the presence of digestive symptoms. The recruited subjects were required to perform breath tests after the acute ingestion of: (1) ice cream containing 20 g of lactose without a probiotic (HBT1); (2) the same ice cream, accompanied by a lactase tablet (HBT2); (3) the same ice cream containing the low or high dose of probiotic (HBT3-LD and HBT3-HD); and (4) after the chronic consumption of the ice cream without (placebo) or with the low concentration of probiotic for 1 month (HBT4). Significant decreases in H2 excretion during HBT2 and HBT3-HD as well as digestive symptoms during HBT2, HBT3-HD and HBT3-LD were observed compared to HBT0 and HBT1, while the orocecal transit time increased. Chronic consumption of the probiotic ice cream did not enhance lactose tolerance compared to the placebo. These results suggest that the acute ingestion of ice cream containing high or low concentrations of B. bifidum 900791 improves lactose tolerance in hypolactasic subjects. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Aguilera, J. M.							The concept of alimentation and transdisciplinary research.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Although the term "alimentation" has existed in the English language since the late 16th century, its use is infrequent. In Latin languages, particularly French, "alimentation" conveys a holistic notion of the process by which humans produce, procure, prepare, share, indulge in, and digest their foods. Thus, the concept of alimentation encompasses and integrates human, technological, sociocultural, and environmental domains. This article delves into the origins of the term "alimentation" and its use in the foreign scientific literature, and particularly in the social sciences. Unlike "food and nutrition", alimentation provides a broader frame for the grand challenges of what, how, and with whom we eat. This approach should lead to transdisciplinary research (TDR) interfacing several knowledge domains (e.g., environmental, technological, socio-cultural, nutritional, etc.) and involving key stakeholders. Possible outcomes of TDR in alimentation are inspiring and meaningful collaborations, innovative methodologies for integrating knowledge, transformative learning of researchers, enriched educational experiences for students, focused community action, and improved public policy. The term "alimentation" is appropriately used in French and other Latin languages. Alimentation embraces human, technological, sociocultural, and environmental issues.

Investigating edible insects as a sustainable food source: nutritional value and techno-functional and physiological properties.		Food & Function					This work is aimed to evaluate the nutritional composition, and the techno-functional and in vitro physiological properties of flours made using six different insect species and the sensorial feasibility of including them in bakery products. The insect flours exhibited high protein and fat contents as their main components, highlighting the presence of chitin in ant samples. The techno-functional properties showed high oil holding, swelling, and emulsifying capacities in all the analysed insect flours, whereas their bulk density, hydration properties, and foaming capacity showed average values and no gelation capacity. Moreover, these edible insect flours exhibited effective hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia properties, which together with their high antioxidant capacity are associated with beneficial in vitro physiological effects. The beetle and caterpillar flours stand out in these properties, and thus were selected to make a cupcake. The sensory evaluation confirmed that the edible beetle powder can be successfully included in baked goods to provide excellent sensory properties and very high acceptance. Thus, these insect flours may be of great interest to the food industry as a healthy source of protein, exerting a positive impact on functional and sensory food properties, and with a potential role in the prevention of diseases associated with hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Investigating the role of hyaluronic acid in improving curcumin bioaccessibility from nanoemulsions.		Food Chemistry					A major challenge in delivering curcumin effectively to the gut is its low solubility. One interesting approach to increase curcumin bioaccessibility is its emulsification. Here, we present curcumin-loaded liquid lipid nanocapsules (LLNs), obtained through olive oil emulsification, in which LLNs are coated by a protective shell composed of Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and hyaluronic acid (HA). Bioaccessibility of curcumin is evaluated following a standard in vitro digestion protocol. The presence of HA in the shell increases the amount of curcumin retained in the LLNs after in vitro gastric digestion from ~25% to ~85%. This protective effect occurs when HA binds to BSA in the shell. Moreover, this binding appears to be reinforced under gastric conditions, hence evidencing the crucial role of interfacial composition in protecting encapsulated curcumin. Interfacial engineering of nanoemulsions provides a route to improve the bioaccessibility of encapsulated curcumin at different stages in the gut.

Nutritional quality of the most consumed varieties of raw and cooked rice in Spain submitted to an in vitro digestion model.		Foods					Rice is one of the most consumed staple foods around the world and its trade is highly globalized. Increased environmental pollution generates a large amount of waste that, in many cases, is discarded close to culture fields. Some species are able to bioaccumulate toxic substances, such as metals, that could be transferred to the food chain. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the content of metallic (Al, Cd, Pb, and Cr) and metalloid elements (As) in 14 of the most consumed varieties of rice in Spain and their effects on human health. The samples were cooked, and human digestion was simulated by using a standard in vitro digestion method. Metallic and metalloid element levels were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES), previous called microwave digestion. Both the human health risk index, Hazard Quotient, and Lifetime Cancer Risk did not show toxic values in any case. Rice with a higher non-digestible fraction showed a higher liberation of proteins and a lower glycemic index. There were no significant differences in the concentrations of metallic and metalloid elements in cooked rice or in the digestible fraction in all varieties analysed. However, Al concentrations were higher than other metals in all varieties studied due to its global distribution. No relationship has been observed between the digestibility of rice and the bioaccessibility of each metallic and metalloid element. All of the studied rice varieties are healthy food products and its daily consumption is safe. The regular monitoring of metals and As in rice consumed in Spain may contribute to improvements in the human health risk evaluation. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Proteins isolated from Ganxet common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) landrace: techno-functional and antioxidant properties.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Ganxet protein isolates (GPI) were assessed for antioxidant and functional properties including emulsifying and foaming capacity. The protein content and water activity (aw) value of GPI were 91.08 4.15% and 0.248 0.008%, respectively. The oil-and water-holding capacities of GPI were calculated as 2.76 0.33 and 1.25 0.11 gg-1 of GPI, respectively (P< 0.05). Foaming and emulsifying properties were found to be pH-dependent (P< 0.05). The highest foaming capacity values were observed at pH 8.0 and 10.0 and were calculated as 86.25 5.30% and 78.75 1.77%, respectively. In addition, the generated emulsions were found to be stable, especially at pH 8.0 and 10.0 with emulsion stability values of 94.1 0.0 and 93.9 0.1, respectively (P< 0.05). Results obtained in the current study demonstrate the potential applications of Ganxet-derived proteins as techno-functional ingredients for the development of novel foods. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Maqui-berry is characterised by presenting a high concentration of (poly) phenols, accounting anthocyanins (cyanidin and delphinidin) for over 85% of the total. These coloured flavonoids have demonstrated potential neurological activity, but the evidence of their antinociceptive properties is scarce. In order to cover this gap, different doses (suitable for human administration) of a maqui-berry powder (1.6% anthocyanin), using enteral and parenteral routes of administration, were compared at central and peripheral levels using a nociceptive pain model (formalin test) in mice. Gastric damage analysis as possible adverse effects of analgesic and anti-inflammatory drugs was also explored. Dose-antinociceptive response was confirmed using both routes of administration and in both neurogenic and inflammatory phases of the formalin test, without gastric damage. In conclusion, these preliminary data provide evidence of pharmacological properties of maqui-berry to alleviate nociceptive pain. © 2021 The Author(s).

J		Agunloye, O. M.							Effect of aqueous extracts of Pleurotus ostreatus and Lentinus subnudus on activity of adenosine deaminase, arginase, cholinergic enzyme, and angiotensin-1-converting enzyme.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Pleurotus ostreatus (P. ostreatus) and Lentinus subnudus (L. subnudus) commonly consumed as food or as food supplement have been reported in folklore for their antihypertensive property with limited scientific proof. This study aims to unravel the antihypertensive mechanism of P. ostreatus and L. subnudus in vitro. The antioxidant properties of P. ostreatus and L. subnudus were established via standard antioxidant assays. Also, the effect of P. ostreatus and L. subnudus extracts on relevant enzymes associated to the development of hypertension were evaluated. Findings from this study revealed that P. ostreatus and L. subnudus extracts exhibited antihypertensive and antioxidant properties. Meanwhile, according to our results, various bioactive compounds present in P. ostreatus and L. subnudus could be responsible for the observed in vitro antihypertensive property. Practical applications. P. ostreatus and L. subnudus are the most commonly consumed mushrooms by the rural dwellers in South Western Nigeria, perhaps, based on their nutritive value and health-enhancing benefits. This paper showed that P. ostreatus and L. subnudus possess antihypertensive and antioxidant properties. Thus, their consumption as foods or food supplements may provide therapeutic benefits for hypertensive patients. Therefore, P. ostreatus and L. subnudus are promising candidates for the development of nutraceuticals. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13490					FSTA:2021-07-Jq9404
J		Agunloye, O. M.; Oboh, G.							Effect of diet supplemented with P. Ostreatus and L. Subnudus on memory index and key enzymes linked with Alzheimer's disease in streptozotocin-induced diabetes rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Mushrooms have been reported in folklore for the management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and diabetes with limited scientific prove. This study aims to unravel the effect of diets supplemented with P. ostreatus and L. subnudus on diabetic encephalopathy (DE) in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. The memory index, brain cholinesterase, arginase activity, and markers for oxidative stress were evaluated. STZ-induced diabetic rats exhibited memory deficits, elevated brain cholinesterase, arginase activity in comparison with nondiabetic rats. Also, markers for oxidative stress were altered in the brain of diabetic rat when compare with nondiabetic rats. Meanwhile, diabetic rats fed with supplemented-diets exhibited better memory index, reduced cholinesterase, arginase activity in comparison with untreated diabetic rats placed on a basal diet. Also, supplemented-diets restored altered markers of oxidative stress. Our findings indicated that P. ostreatus and L. subnudus-supplemented diets could prevent DE. Nevertheless, diets supplemented with L. subnudus had better nutraceutical potential than P. ostreatus. Practical applications. Diabetes mellitus is one of the most chronic diseases in the world. Also, it is a risk factor for several complications such as cognitive dysfunction, hypertension, and other health issues. Mushrooms are commonly consumed as food or as food supplements in many countries of the world and are a rich source of protein, chitin, and vitamins. Diet supplemented with P. ostreatus and L. subnudus were able to restore memory deficit in diabetic rats, proven to be a dietary intervention in the management of memory deficit linked with diabetes mellitus. Findings from this study show that consumption of P. ostreatus and L. subnudus as food or supplement could help in a diabetic state. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Migration of red grape extract components and glycerol from soybean protein concentrate active films into food simulants.		Food Hydrocolloids					Migration of glycerol and red grape extract (RGE) components from bioactive soybean protein concentrate (SPC) films into aqueous and fatty food simulants was performed as a function of temperature. GC-MS and HPLC methods were applied to quantify the amount of glycerol and RGE individual components migrated into the simulants. Overall migration (OM) in fatty simulant was below the limit imposed by the legislation of 10 mg/dm2. RGE components migrated preferentially to the fatty simulant due to the structural complexity and solubility of the migrant. Contrarily, glycerol was released at higher extent and rate into aqueous medium, due to its inherent hydrophilic nature. Migration process was described by Fick's diffusion second law, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (Dapp) was derived from an analytical solution. Dapp values ranged from 1.5 * 10-14 to 1.6 * 10-13 cm2 s-1 under different conditions. The efficiency of SPC films was tested on steam cooked mackerel chunks during storage 4 1 °C for 21 days. Antioxidant activity of films decayed upon storage but both kept more that 50% of their initial radical scavenging activity after 21 d. SPC-RGE film delayed the maximum oxidation by 3 d compared to the control and samples packed in SPC film, more likely due to the lower oxygen permeability and higher radical scavenging activity of SPC-RGE film. Findings suggested that films based on SPC containing RGE can be considered as potential sustainable active food packaging material.

Journal of Dairy Science					Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) synthesizes enzymes that degrade lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of Pleurotus ostreatus spent substrate (POSS) on whole-plant corn silage (WPCS) chemical composition, antioxidant capacity, lignin monomers, and in vitro digestibility, as well as the performance of lactating goats fed corn silage treated with different levels of POSS. In experiment 1, 4 levels of lignocellulolytic enzymes were tested in a complete randomized design: 0,10, 20, and 30 mg of lignocellulosic enzymes per kilogram of fresh matter, 4 replicates per treatment (vacuum-sealed bags). The bags were opened 60 d after ensiling. In experiment 2, corn silage treated with 3 enzyme levels (0, 10, or 30 mg/kg of fresh matter) was fed to lactating goats as part of the total mixed ration. Nine lactating Saanen goats (62.68 7.62 kg BW; 44 8 d in milk; 2.91 0.81 kg of milk/day, mean SD) were assigned to three 3*3 Latin squares. Data were analyzed using the GLIMMIX procedure of SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc.), and means were compared by linear and quadratic orthogonal contrast. In experiment 1, neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), lignin, and cellulose quadratically decreased in the WPCS treated with POSS. At the nadir point, POSS decreased NDF by 14.1%, ADF by 19.5%, lignin by 9.07%, and cellulose by 22.1% compared with the untreated silage. Therefore, POSS led to a quadratic increase in in vitro dry matter digestibility of WPCS (+8.88% at the vertex) compared with the untreated silage. In experiment 2, POSS quadratically increased the in vivo total-tract ADF digestibility. Also, the concentration of polyphenols in the milk of goats linearly increased with the addition of POSS, and no differences were observed among treatments for milk yield and composition. In summary, adding 10 mg of lignocellulolytic enzymes from POSS per kilogram of fresh matter of whole-plant corn at ensiling had a more evident reduction in lignin and cellulose concentration, leading to greater in vitro digestibility, as well as greater in vivo ADF digestibility; however, milk yield was not different among treatments.

Multi-chemical analysis combined with chemometrics to characterize PDO and PGI Italian apples.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The use of PDO (protected designation of origin) and PGI (protected geographical indication) labels allows to protect and promote agricultural products characterized by unique features related to the place of origin and traditional know-how. However, the presence of non-authentic products in the market represents a fraud that can be tackled applying analytical techniques combined with chemometric analysis. In this study, we applied multi-element and multi-isotope analysis to characterize PDO and PGI apples cultivated in northern Italy, comparing them with Italian apples without labels of geographical indications. Results. The multi-element and multi-isotope approach allowed to characterize the apples cultivated in northern Italy. Despite a significant effect of the sampling sites on the apple composition, the comparison of the multi-chemical fingerprint of the apples significantly varied among cultivation areas. Results. Of this characterization were used to classify samples according to their cultivation area applying a linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Outputs of the LDA showed that correct sample classification can be successfully achieved (balanced accuracy >96%). Moreover, using a selection of variables, it was possible to correctly classify samples also at regional level. Conclusion. The presented evidences indicate that the multi-element and multi-isotope fingerprint can be successfully applied to traceability studies. The combination of this characterization with chemometric tools allows the classification of Italian apples based on their origin both on a national and regional scale. This approach represents an interesting tool to enhance and protect PDO and PGI Italian products. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Agyemang, K.; Donkor, P. O.; Ayim, I.; Adzitey, F.; Lin Lin; Haiying Cui							Antibacterial activity and mechanism of Tetrapleura tetraptera stem extract against Salmonella strains and its application in raw chicken meat.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					We studied the antibacterial activity and mechanism of Tetrapleura tetraptera stem extract against Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium and its applications in chicken meat. The extract showed significant antibacterial activity in vitro, minimum inhibitory concentration, and minimum bactericidal concentration on the pathogens was found to be 12.5-50.0 mg/ml. The mechanism of action of the T. tetraptera stem on S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium was largely characterized by the changes in the cell integrity, cell membrane permeability which caused the outflow of the intracellular substances such as ATP, DNA, protein, and K+. The extract eventually inhibited bacterial respiratory metabolism through the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathways. Furthermore, T. tetraptera showed a significant effect in controlling the growth rate of S. enteritidis and S. typhimurium in meat samples during the 7-day incubation period, and the surface color and sensory properties were not adversely affected. Practical applications: T. tetraptera is a flowering plant which can be used in local cuisine and traditional medicine. Interestingly, this plant is used in our daily dishes as herbs, spices, seasonings, and preservatives. T. tetraptera stem extract has high antibacterial activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. This study could contribute to a better understanding of antibacterial activity and the mechanism of T. tetraptera in food. As a preservative for natural foods, it could be used in the meat industry. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Foods					In this study, the rheological properties of several commercial rice noodle strands were investigated. In the bending test, failure stress decreased as the cooking temperature increased from 80 to 90°C, and the cooking time increased from 3 to 4min for higher rice content noodles (>60%). The stress-relaxation test and sensory tests were carried out with bundles of noodles to investigate correlations with the bending test. The modulus of elasticity was higher at 80 than 90°C. However, no correlation was found between cooking temperature and the rheological properties of lower rice content noodles. In the stress relaxation test, the deviation was larger due to the empty space in the bundle. In the correlation analysis, sensory stickiness was correlated with a modulus of elasticity in the bending test. Comparing the bending and stress-relaxation tests, each instrumental variable showed differences in the rheological properties of rice noodles in strands and bundles. However, the bending test measured with noodle strands seemed to be most suitable as a method of measuring the rheological properties of rice noodles. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ah-Na Kim; Shafiur Rahman, M.; Kyo-Yeon Lee; Sung-Gil Choi							Superheated steam pretreatment of rice flours: gelatinization behavior and functional properties during thermal treatment.		Food Bioscience					The effect of superheated steam pretreatment on the gelatinization behavior and functional properties of waxy and non-waxy rice flour were studied. The superheated steam-treated waxy rice flours and non-waxy rice flours showed significantly lower onset of gelatinization temperatures (58.8 and 56.1 °C, respectively) than that of their respective control. Water binding capacity, swelling power, solubility and particle size of rice flours were evaluated from 20 to 90 °C. Before the gelatinization temperature (<60 °C), the water binding capacity and swelling power were about 1.7 times higher for the superheated steam treated waxy rice flour and 1.4 times higher for the superheated steam treated non-waxy rice flour than those of their control. The superheated steam treated non-waxy rice flour had a significantly higher particle diameter (82 mum) than the other flours. The granules of superheated steam-treated flours were swollen more than the native flours granules due to partial gelatinization. Superheated steam may be a promising physical method for modification of specific properties of rice in terms of gelatinization behavior, granular structure and functional characteristics of rice flours.

L.; Sung-Gil Choi							Thermal treatment of apple puree under oxygen-free condition: effect on phenolic compounds, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activities, color, and enzyme activities.		Food Bioscience					The effect of heating in the absence or presence of oxygen on the enzyme activity and nutritional quality of apple puree were investigated. Using designed equipment, apples were vacuum-ground, packaged, and heated under vacuum (2.67 kPa, 90 °C for 30 min) to limit exposure to oxygen, and compared to those heated in open air. All thermal treatments led to complete inactivation of oxidative enzymes. Heating without oxygen effectively maintained color, antioxidant activity, phenolic compounds, and ascorbic acid, as compared to fresh apples. In contrast, heating with oxygen led to considerable browning and degradation of antioxidant activities, phenolics, and ascorbic acid. The results indicate that thermal processing without oxygen can help preserve the nutritional value and retard changes in phenolic-related quality of fruits and vegetables. This study suggests that browning and nutritional loss during thermal treatment of apple may be attributed to oxidation, which is accelerated by the elevated temperature.

L.; Sung-Gil Choi							Thermal processing under oxygen-free condition of blueberry puree: effect on anthocyanin, ascorbic acid, antioxidant activity, and enzyme activities.		Food Chemistry					The effect of thermal treatment of blueberry was investigated using a designed grinding and continuous packaging system under oxygen-free conditions. The grinding, packaging, and heating at 90 °C for 30 min under anaerobic condition were compared to heating under aerobic conditions, showing complete inactivation of oxidative enzymes. Heating without oxygen retained anthocyanins and ascorbic acid whereas heating in atmospheric air does not. Delphinidin glycoside was mostly influenced by oxygen deficiency during heating, followed by petunidin and malvidin glycosides. The differences in oxygen sensitivity may be closely associated with the number of hydroxylation in the B ring. The result of anthocyanin led to higher antioxidant activity and redness values of purees heated without oxygen than purees heated with oxygen. Consequently, thermal processing under oxygen-free condition can prevent oxidation of anthocyanin, resulting in higher retention of color and nutritional values of blueberry products.

Grinding under vacuum resulted in significantly greater antioxidant activity retention (78.6-92.1%) as compared to grinding in atmospheric conditions (48.4-68.2%) during storage at all temperatures. Samples ground under vacuum showed delayed or no growth of total aerobic counts, anaerobic bacteria, and mould and yeast, while control groups showed significant microbial growth. Taxonomic composition analysis of samples at day 7 and 25 °C, showed the most abundant bacteria of the control group were from the genus Rahnella belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria, while those of the vacuum-processed groups were from the genus Lactobacillus belonging to the phylum Firmicutes. Consequently, vacuum grinding and packaging can be used in developing technology for preservation of nutritional quality and microbial safety of strawberry puree.

J		Ah-Na Kim; Kyo-Yeon Lee; Eun Ji Jeong; Si Won Cha; Bo Gyeong Kim; William L. Kerr; Sung-Gil Choi							Effect of vacuum-grinding on the stability of anthocyanins, ascorbic acid, and oxidative enzyme activity of strawberry.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, strawberries were ground at vacuum levels of 2.67, 6.67, 13.33, 19.99, and 101.33kPa (atmospheric pressure) using a specially designed vacuum grinding and continuous packaging device. The grinding at higher vacuum levels led to better maintenance of ascorbic acid and anthocyanins, resulting in a higher antioxidant activity and redness due to the low oxygen availability limiting oxidation. Vacuum-grinding below 2.67kPa prevented the oxidation of pelargonidin glycosides to a greater degree than that of cyanidin and delphinidin glycoside, due to structural differences related to the number of hydroxyl groups in the B ring, revealing the faster oxidation rate of diphenolic anthocyanins. The model fits indicated a logarithmic rather than a linear degradation as the oxygen level increased, indicating that even small amount of oxygen may cause drastic quality deterioration during grinding. Overall, our results indicate that vacuum grinding at very low oxygen levels is an effective technology to prevent the oxidation of anthocyanins and ascorbic acid, resulting in higher redness and antioxidant activities in strawberries.

J		Ahadi Abdillah, A.; Amin Alamsjah, M.; Charles, A. L							An optimised low-salinity seawater decolourising method produces decolourised seaweed (Kappaphycuz alvarezii) as semi-refined carrageenan raw material.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Semi-refined carrageenan (SRC) production from decolourised Kappaphycuz alvarezii treated by chemicals (CaCO3) drives the search for "greener" decolourisation methods to sustainably supply cheaper and energy efficient products. Therefore, a decolourisation method of low-salinity seawater (LSS) (3, 9 and 15 g/L) was investigated to replace CaCO3. In addition, decolourised seaweed colour powder (DSP) and SRC colour, yield, viscosity and gel strength were used to screen the salinity treatments. SRC prepared from LSS (3 g/L) treatment demonstrated similar colour and physical properties to CaCO3 treatments, which indicated low-salinity seawater (3 g/L) could replace CaCO3 as a decolourising agent. Moreover, purity of SRC (3 g/L salinity) were confirmed by x-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray (SEM-EDX), and its functional group by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). In this study, waste seawater from LSS (3 g/L) exhibited radical scavenging properties. This decolourising method could be easily adopted by smallholder seaweed farmers in low-and middle-income countries. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	5	2336	2344	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14856					FSTA:2021-08-Rg2942
J		Ahmad Alshannaq; Jae-Hyuk Yu							Analysis of E.U. Rapid Alert System (RASFF) notifications for aflatoxins in exported U. S. food and feed products for 2010-2019.		Toxins					The most common, toxic, and carcinogenic mycotoxins found in human food and animal feed are the aflatoxins (AFs). The United States is a leading exporter of various nuts, with a marketing value of $9.1 billion in 2019; the European Union countries are the major importers of U.S. Nuts. In the past few years, border rejections and notifications for U.S. Tree nuts and peanuts exported to the E. U. Countries have increased due to AF contamination. In this work, we analyzed notifications from the "Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF)" on U.S. Food and feed products contaminated with mycotoxins, primarily AFs, for the 10-year period 2010-2019. Almost 95% of U.S. Mycotoxin RASFF notifications were reported for foods and only 5% for feeds. We found that 98.9% of the U.S. Food notifications on mycotoxins were due to the AF contamination in almond, peanut, and pistachio nuts. Over half of these notifications (57.9%) were due to total AF levels greater than the FDA action level in food of 20 ng g-1. The Netherlands issued 27% of the AF notifications for U.S. Nuts. Border rejection was reported for more than 78% of AF notifications in U.S. Nuts. all U.S. Feed notifications on mycotoxins occurred due to the AF contamination. Our research contributes to better understanding the main reasons behind RASFF mycotoxins notifications of U.S. food and feed products destined to E. U. countries. Furthermore, we speculate possible causes of this problem and provide a potential solution that could minimize the number of notifications for U.S. Agricultural export market. © 2021 by the authors.

Prebiotic potential and characterization of resistant starch developed from four Himalayan rice cultivars using beta-amylase and transglucosidase enzymes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present work, resistant starch (RS) was developed from four Himalayan rice cultivars by using enzymatic treatment with beta-amylase and transglucosidase enzymes so as to make them the potential prebiotic. Thereafter, the prebiotic potential of resistant starch was confirmed by their invitro fermentation using selected probiotic strains. Fermentation of RS by Lactobacilli resulted in the production of 276.45-300.15 mug/mL of acetic acid, 0.40-0.83 mug/mL of propionic acid and 0.73-1.94 mug/mL of butyric acid. The capability of resistant starches to produce the SCFA (Short chain fatty acids) including butyrate confirmed their potential as substrates for beneficial colon bacteria. In general, pasting properties of resistant starch samples were significantly (p≤0.05) lower than native rice starch samples. Resistant starches exhibited shear-thinning behaviour. The DSC results revealed significant decrease in the gelatinization temperatures and enthalpy (DeltaH) of resistant starches. The resistant starches completely lost their granular integrity and formed a continuous compact fibrous network with irregular shape. XRD analysis revealed the formation of amylose-lipid complexes during the treatment. The decreased intensity at 1047 cm-1 in resistant starches reveals their lower crystallinity. The study revealed that enzymatic treatment of rice starch significantly increased their production of SCFA thereby making them potential prebiotic.

J		Ahmad Ashwar, B.; Asir Gani; Adil Gani; Mudasir Ahmad; Asima Shah							Encapsulating probiotics in novel resistant starch wall material for production of rice flour extrudates.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Rice flour was substituted with RS4 microcapsules at 0%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20% substitution levels to prepare functional extrudates. Pasting properties of rice flour-RS4 blends displayed significant (p≤0.05) decreases in pasting properties with increasing RS4 content. The increase of RS4 content in flour resulted in the fall of both storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G). The amylose content, RS content and water intake capacity of extrudates increased significantly with increasing RS4 content. Addition of RS4 microcapsules up to 20% did not affect the textural parameters of extrudates. Thermal transition temperatures of rice extrudates also increased with the percentage of increased RS4. SEM images of RS4-rice flour extrudate samples showed a more discontinuous structure with cracks and void spaces compared to control. FT-IR spectra revealed a new peak between 1244 and 1266 cm-1 in RS4 enriched extrudates which is attributed PO stretching in RS4. The survival of probiotics after extrusion demonstrated that RS4 microcapsules can be incorporated into the extrudates for preparation of functional foods. Addition of RS4 to rice extrudates up to 20% did not affect the overall acceptability of these products by consumers.

J		Ahmad Bhat, N.; Adil Gani; Khalid Muzaffar; Masarat Dar, M.							Enhancing the nutraceutical potential of Himalayan cheese (kradi) through saffron fortification.		Food Bioscience					Dairy products are widely consumed across the globe owing to their high nutritional value and thus can serve as an excellent medium for the delivery of bioactive compounds. The study was aimed to prepare kradi cheese enriched with saffron (25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg and 100 mg of saffron/50 g of cheese). The product was analyzed for physicochemical, antioxidant and medicinal properties. The moisture, protein, fat and ash contents of kradi cheese samples were between 31.8 and 38.9%, 27.9-28.2%, 6.89-7.13% and 1.14-1.52%, respectively. The enriched kradi showed considerably high "a" and "b" values as compared to the control. The HPLC analysis revealed that the enriched kradi had the highest crocin content (3.08-5.67 mug/g) than the safranal content (0.45-1.07 mug/g). Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of enriched kradi were highly improved due to the presence of saffron secondary metabolites. The enriched kradi had desirable organoleptic properties compared to the control.

J		Ahmad Bhat, P.; Nighat Nazir; Ahmad Chat, O.; Ahmad Dar, A.							Exploiting self-assembled soft systems based on surfactants, biopolymers and their mixtures for inhibition of Citral degradation under harsh acidic Conditions.		Food Chemistry					The chemical instability of Citral in acidic conditions is viewed as hurdle to commercialize it in food/beverage industries. We attempted to stabilize citral in various single and mixed surfactant systems at pH 1.0 and temperature 25 °C. The study highlights the importance of amount and density of positive charge of cationic surfactants and oxyethylene content of nonionic surfactants at the interface of self-assembly in inhibiting citral degradation. The hybrid of Chitosan and P123 showed a significant increase in the half-life of citral compared to that in its individual components. The results of the study suggest that it is possible to stabilize citral in strong acidic environs having a pH as low as 1.0 using mixed surfactant or polymer-amphiphile systems with significant positive charge/number of oxyethylene in their single components. Such polymer-surfactant systems formulations if biocompatible/food grade may act as promising media to enhance shelf life of citral.

J		Ahmad Bhat, T.; Hamid Rather, A.; Zameer Hussain, S.; Bazila Naseer; Tahiya Qadri; Nowsheen Nazir							Efficacy of ascorbic acid, citric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 4-hexylresorcinol as inhibitors of enzymatic browning in osmo-dehydrated fresh cut kiwis.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of osmo-dehydration using four anti-browning agents (ascorbic acid (AA), citric acid (CA), EDTA and 4-Hexylresorcinol (4-HR)) on physico-chemical, color and browning phenomenon in commonly consumed fresh cut kiwis (var. Hayward) of Kashmir region. Osmo-dehydration was carried out using 60% glucose+1% calcium chloride solution under ambient conditions and concentration of anti-browning agents-ascorbic acid, citric acid, EDTA and 4-HR were varied between 0.5 and 2.5%, 0.5-1.5%, 0.25-1.25 and 0.01-0.05%, respectively, using central composite rotatable design. Browning index, polyphenol oxidase activity, and yellowness (b*) were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased, whereas brightness (L*) and greenness (-a*) were significantly (p < 0.05) increased with the increase in concentration of each anti-browning agent. Out of all the anti-browning agents tested, 4-HR recorded dominant linear effect on each parameter. Design expert predicted optimum concentrations of AA as 2%, CA as 1.3%, EDTA as 1% and HR as 0.04% for reducing browning and preserving color parameters during osmotic-dehydration of kiwifruit slices. Kiwifruit slices osmo-dehydrated with optimum concentration of anti-browning agents showed significantly (p < 0.05) higher water loss and lower water activity than fresh kiwifruits. Anti-oxidant activity and ascorbic acid of kiwi slices increased significantly (p < 0.05) when osmo-dehydrated with optimum concentration of anti-browning agents than kiwi slices osmo-dehydrated without anti-browning agents. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4354	4370	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01017-2					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0765
J		Ahmad F. Alhomodi; Zavadil, A.; Berhow, M.; Gibbons, W. R.; Karki, B.							Daily development of nutritional composition of canola sprouts followed by solid-state fungal fermentation.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Sprouting is a beneficial way to increase the nutritional value of the original seeds. Besides, fungal fermentation of sprouts can further improve sprouts composition by reducing antinutritional factors and concentrating protein content. Thus, this study characterized the daily nutritional changes in canola sprouts and further evaluated the effect of fungal fermentation on 144 h sprouts under solid state fermentation conditions. Sprouting process resulted in high moisture containing sprouts (75.3%) due to water uptake by seeds. The oil content of sprouts (27.2% at 144 h) was significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced when compared to raw seeds (39.6%). Likewise, phytic acid, crude fiber, acid detergent fiber, and neutral detergent fibers were reduced by 49.7, 32.8, 19.7, and 16.6%, respectively, when compared to raw seeds. There were significant increases in protein and carbohydrate contents of sprouts, and glucosinolates also increased from 1.3 to 3.5 M/g post sprouting. Fungal fermentation with Neurospora crassa resulted in the highest protein increase (32.8%). Heat-sterilization reduced total glucosinolates by 38.8%, and a further reduction (4.0%) was obtained by fermentation with Trichoderma reesei. A reduction in phytic acid content of 81.4, 45.8, and 10.2% was achieved by fermentation with N. crassa, T. reesei, and Aureobasidium pullulans, respectively. Total carbohydrates was reduced by 3.3 mg/mL post heat-sterilization, and fungal fermentation led to the further reduction of total carbohydrates, but total fibers were found to be increased post fermentation. These results highlight the enhancement of nutritional values of sprouted seeds and further fermented sprouts compared to ungerminated seeds and unfermented sprouts, respectively. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	9	1673	1683	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02667-2					FSTA:2022-01-Js0101
J		Ahmad, H.; Lihua Zhao; Changkun Liu; Chaojie Cai; Fuqing Ma							Ultrasound assisted dispersive solid phase microextraction of inorganic arsenic from food and water samples using CdS nanoflowers combined with ICP-OES determination.		Food Chemistry					Direct determination of arsenic species in real samples is challenging due to their trace concentration and spectral interferences by coexisting ions. Herein, we proposed an ultrasound-assisted dispersive solid phase microextraction (DSPME) procedure for the analyses of the trace inorganic arsenic. The hydrothermally synthesized cadmium sulfide nanoparticles (CdS NPs) completely adsorbed both arsenic species within 20 s at the initial arsenic concentration of 100 g L-1. The detection limit (3 S/m) of the proposed method was found to be 0.50.2 and 0.80.2 ng L-1 for As (III) and As (V), respectively. The accuracy of the method against the systematic and constant errors was confirmed by the analysis of the Standard Reference Material (SRM) (>95% recovery with <5% RSD). The Student's t-test values were found to be less than the critical Student's t value at a 95% confidence level. The method was successfully employed for the determination of arsenic in food samples.

J		Ahmad Mir, S.; Mohmad Wani, S.; Ahmad Masoodi, F.							Impact of thermal processing time on various quality attributes of meatballs (rista) during storage.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Meatballs (rista) being processed traditionally suffer loss in nutrient, textural, and sensory value. This study was aimed to evaluate the effect of thermal processing time on texture, cooking attributes, collagen solubility, and proximate composition of meatballs. Meatballs were processed at 121°C for 20min (T1), 25min (T2), and 30min (T3). Meatballs hot-filled at 100 °C acted as control (C). The values for conjugated dienes ranged from 0.43 to 2.12mumol/mg over a period of 12months of storage in the case of T1 sample. However, the value of collagen solubility varied from 12.17 to 26.16% and carbonyl content from 0.19 to 9.14nmol/mg protein, respectively. The tyrosine value at the 12th month of storage for T1, T2, and T3 was 1.53, 1.28, and 0.92mg/kg, respectively, which was significantly (p ≤ .05) higher than the initial values. The overall quality attributes of T1 were significantly (p ≤ .05) higher among all samples. Practical applications. The traditional meatballs (rista) are among the commonly consumed processed meat products. These meatballs are preferred over raw meat and stored for a longer duration when abundantly available. A need was felt to standardize the time of processing in order to avoid the undesirable changes during the processing of meatballs at a higher temperature for a longer period. Processing meatballs (rista) for a longer time at a higher temperature not only causes quality degradation but also results in loss of nutritive value. The standardized time-temperature combination will result in retaining the quality attributes of the processed meat when stored for a longer duration. This method can be applicable at the local and industrial levels. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	12			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13905					FSTA:2022-03-Sa1619
J		Ahmad Nourmohammadi; Ebrahim Ahmadi; Ali Heshmati							Optimization of physicochemical, textural, and rheological properties of sour cherry jam containing stevioside by using response surface methodology.		Food Science & Nutrition					The response surface method (RSM) was used to produce sour cherry jam containing stevia sweetener with favorable physicochemical, textural, and rheological properties. The experiments were designed based on RSM using a central composite design (CCD) with three independent variables: sugar, pectin, and stevia. Sample processing was performed at five levels of sucrose (10%-50%), pectin (0.1%-0.5%), and stevia (0.2%-0.6%) at a constant fruit weight of 300 g. To evaluate the jam, the physicochemical, textural, and rheological properties of the jam were determined and optimized. The concentrations of sucrose, pectin, and stevia had a significant effect on the textural and rheological properties of the jam. The results showed that increasing the concentration of sucrose is the main factor in increasing the soluble solids and the total sugar content of the jam. Pectin had a positive effect on textural characteristics such as hardness and adhesiveness of the jam, while the cohesiveness of the jam decreased with increasing pectin. Herschel-Bulkley model was appropriate for describing the rheological behavior of the stable state of sour cherry jam containing stevia. Decreasing sucrose concentration is accompanied by a decrease in yield stress and consistency index of jam samples due to the TSS reduction. Pectin also had a positive effect on the amount of yield stress and consistency index. Dynamic rheological tests indicated that the sour cherry jam is a weak gel. The predominant viscose behavior and the formation of a dilute solution were evident in the samples with 10% and 20% sucrose concentrations. The most favorable condition for the production of the jam was obtained at a 36.5% sugar, 0.277% pectin, and stevia 0.30%. © 2021 The Authors.

Evaluation of solvent and temperature effect on green accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and UHPLC quantification of phenolics in fresh olive fruit (Olea europaea).		Food Chemistry					A green ASE (accelerated solvent extraction) with a shorter UHPLC (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography) method was developed for simultaneous determination of phenolics. High extract yield (130 mg/g) was observed for water at 100 °C in a short time of 19.5 min using 33.5 mL solvent whereas, UHPLC showed more phenolics of GA (gallic acid), QT (quercetin), LT (luteolin) in ACE (acetone) and RT (rutin) in EtOH (ethanol) solvent at 60 °C. The binary solvent system of ACE: EtOH (1:1) at 60 °C was optimized as extraction set. UHPLC runtime was 3 min with retention times of (min); 0.63 (GA), 0.97 (RT), 2.00 (QT) and 2.41 (LT). Average for phenolics (ppm) was, QT (10.91) > GA (7.33) > LT (4.10) > RT (3.90) whereas, Spanish whole green olive (SP2) showed more phenolics (20.72). Individual phenolic was, GA (47.06) > RT (26.21) > QT (19.34) > LT (6.18). Multivariate, K-mean and PCA (principal component analysis) for solvent*extract yield showed significant correlation and temperature showed no significant correlation for phenolics.

Green accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) with solvent and temperature effect and green UHPLC-DAD analysis of phenolics in pepper fruit (Capsicum annum L.).		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The study presents for the first time, a green and efficient accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) method for phenolic compounds (GA gallic acid, QT quercetin, RT rutin, LT luteolin) with simultaneous determination using a green and effective UHPLC-DAD method. The effect of solvents (ACE acetone, EtOH ethanol, and H2O water) and temperatures (60,80, 100 °C) Vs extract yield and phenolic recovery was investigated. The scale-up for ASE-UHPLC method was accomplished in 27 food-grade samples of Capsicum annum/pepper fruit (PF). ASE-MD (method development) showed a high extract yield (198.23 mg/g) in water (33 mL) at 100 °C within a time frame of 19.5 min. UHPLC-DAD revealed more yield for GA in ACE whereas, for RT, QT, LT in EtOH at 60 °C. Binary solvent system (ACE: EtOH; 1:1) and 60 °C was optimized the extraction set. The UHPLC-MDMV showed a run time of 5 min with individual retention times of 0.667 (GA), 1.05 (RT), 3.24 (QT), and 3.78 (LT) in the linearity range (1-100 ppm). The average for phenolics (ppm) in 27 PF-food samples was; GA (19.46) > QT (10.19) > LT (4.06) > RT (2.41). SP4 (Spanish green bell pepper) sample showed more amount of total phenolics (32.52 ppm, 25.36%) whereas, the order for individual phenolic amount (ppm) was; GA (53.39) > QT (13.58) > RT (10.04) > LT (4.62). Multivariate analysis resulted a significant correlation for solvent*temperature with extract yield but with a lack of correlation for phenolics amount. K-mean correlation was positive for solvent Vs phenolic yield (P< 0.05) whereas, extract yield and temperature were less significant for phenolics content. Solvent established a high significant role for extraction and phenolic recovery whereas, temperature was more significant for extract yield rather than phenolic amount.

Food Science & Nutrition					The aim of the present study was to investigate the biological activities of the ultrasound-assisted extracts obtained from pulp and seed of jujube (Ziziphus jujuba) fruits. To reach this purpose, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), total pro-anthocyanin, DPPH radical scavenging activity, rancimat test, as well as antimicrobial activity and cytotoxicity test of both jujube pulp and seed extracts were evaluated. Total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and total pro-anthocyanin in pulp extract were higher than those obtained from seed extract. In addition, DPPH radical scavenging activity of pulp extract (IC50=53.97 g/ml) was higher than that of seed extract (IC50=88.68 g/ml). Furthermore, the highest antimicrobial activity was observed against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus (MIC=20 mg/ml) for both seed and pulp extracts. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation on seven cell lines revealed that pulp and seed extracts of jujube had no cytotoxic activity. The present results suggested the promising antioxidant properties of jujube, which can be used in the fabrication of functional bioactive ingredients for different purposes. © 2020 The Authors.

P.; Suman Talukder							Effect of aerobic storage conditions on the quality of functional restructured buffalo meat fillets enriched with natural sources of dietary fibers and antioxidant components.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Low sodium, high fiber restructured buffalo meat fillets fortified with natural fruit-based antioxidants viz. Apple peel and kinnow (citrus fruit) rind were stored at refrigeration for 21 days under aerobic conditions. The lipid oxidation remained within permissible limits for all the treatments. The antioxidant-treated products (kinnow rind powder and apple peel powder added buffalo meat fillets) retarded the oxidation process significantly (p<.05) when compared to the control (not treated with antioxidant sources). A significant (p<.05) decreasing trend in the color parameters like redness and yellowness was noticed and this decrease was more pronounced for control. The powders of apple peel and kinnow rind exhibited significant (p<.05) antimicrobial effects. The sensory quality of the product was acceptable for all days of storage life. It was concluded that an acceptable quality of low sodium, high fiber, and antioxidant-rich functional restructured buffalo meat fillets could be maintained for at least 21 days at refrigeration temperature under aerobic conditions. Practical applications. The consumer demand for natural functional products like these is ever increasing. The kinnow rind powder as well as the apple peel powder at 1% level proved highly beneficial in preserving the overall functional quality especially the antioxidant potential of buffalo meat fillets.

J		Ahmad Shiekh, K.; Peng Zhou; Soottawat Benjakul							Combined effects of pulsed electric field, Chamuang leaf extract and cold plasma on quality and shelf-life of Litopenaeus vannamei.		Food Bioscience					Pulsed electric field (PEF) pre-treated Litopenaeus vannamei were immersed in Chamuang leaf extract (CLE) solutions (1 or 2%), followed by high voltage cold atmospheric plasma (HVCAP) in an argon/air (80:20) modified atmosphere for 10 min. Least melanosis scores were attained in the samples pre-treated with PEF (15 kV/cm, 800 pulses, 697 kJ/kg) and CLE (2%) prior to HVCAP compared to the untreated control, during 18 days at 4 °C (P< 0.05). The lowest microbial load and spoilage bacteria count (≤5 log CFU/g meat) were attained in PEF treated sample with 2% CLE followed by HVCAP (P< 0.05). Prior PEF sample in presence of 2% CLE showed lower peroxide value, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, pH, total volatile base and protein carbonyl content than others (P< 0.05). Higher likeness scores were noted for all the attributes of the sample with prior PEF and 2% CLE sujected to HVCAP. Oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids and proteins was alleviated by CLE treatment. Phenolic compounds in CLE along with active species generated from HVCAP effectively inhibited microbial growth of L. vannamei during refrigerated storage. Thus, shelf-life of L. vannamei could be extended to 18 days using the selected combined hurdle technologies, while the control (without treatment and kept in air) had the shorter shelf-life (9 days).

J		Ahmad Shiekh, K.; Olatunde, O. O.; Bin Zhang; Huda, N.; Soottawat Benjakul							Pulsed electric field assisted process for extraction of bioactive compounds from custard apple (Annona squamosa) leaves.		Food Chemistry					Impact of pulsed electric field (PEF) assisted process on preparation of custard apple leaf extract (CALE) using ethanol (70%, v/v) was studied. Different electric field strengths (2-6 kV/cm), pulse numbers (100-300 pulses) with specific energies (45-142 kJ/kg) for 2.5 to 5 min were implemented. Cell disintegration index was higher in CALE when PEF 6 kV/cm, 300 pulses, 142 kJ/kg for 5 min was applied. Extraction yield was higher (+5.2%) than the untreated counterpart (13.28%). Chlorophyll A and B contents were negligible in PEF pre-treated CALE. PEF improved radical scavenging activities assessed by DPPH, ABTS radical scavening activities and FRAP. The antibacterial properties of CALE against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli were highest. Purpureacin 2 and rutin were abundant in PEF pre-treated CALE. Therefore PEF was the potential aid in augmenting extraction yield and bioactivities of the extract from custard apple leaves. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ahmad Shiekh, K.; Soottawat Benjakul; Saqib Gulzar							Impact of pulsed electric field and vacuum impregnation with Chamuang leaf extract on quality changes in Pacific white shrimp packaged under modified atmosphere.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Vacuum impregnation-assisted penetration with Chamuang leaf extract (CLE; 1-2 g/100 ml) using 5 kPa absolute of vacuum, 7.5/15 min vacuum time and 15/22.5 min restoration time was studied in Pacific white shrimp subjected to prior pulsed electric field (PEF) before storage at 4 °C in modified atmosphere packaging (Ar/air; 80: 20). Lowest melanosis scores were obtained for samples treated with PEF (15 kV/cm, 800 pulses, 18 kJ/kg) and CLE (2 g/100 ml) with a 15 min vacuum time and 15 min restoration time and kept under an Ar/air atmosphere for 18 days. The control (untreated, kept in air) showed more melanosis during 18 days than treated samples (P< 0.05). Lower bacterial counts were attained in samples vacuum-impregnated with 2 g/100 ml CLE with prior PEF and stored under an Ar/air atmosphere (P< 0.05). These samples had lowest lipid oxidation, pH, total volatile bases and protein carbonyl content (P< 0.05). Higher liking scores for all attributes were noted in PEF-treated and vacuum-impregnated CLE (2 g/100 ml) samples. Thus, shrimp treated with CLE with the aid of combined processes and packaging had a shelf-life up to 18 days.

J		Ahmadi Chenarbon, H.; Sara Movahhed							Assessment of physical and aerodynamic properties of corn kernel (KSC 704).		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Physical and aerodynamic properties of agricultural products have been used to precision design of the machinery and different postharvest operations. In this study, some physical and aerodynamic properties of corn kernels were investigated as a function of size at three levels of small, medium, and large (8.41mm, 9.60mm, and 11.62mm, respectively) and moisture content in the range of 10 to 25% (wet basis). According to results, with increasing the moisture content from 10 to 25%, the length; width; thickness; geometric mean diameter; mass; and volume of the small, medium, and large kernels linearly increased by 2.22%, 2.40%, and 1.68%; 3.76%, 1.82%, and 1.55%; 3.98%, 2.49%, and 2.67%; 3.29%, 2.23%, and 1.93%; 8.44%, 7.38%, and 8.12%; and 11.32%, 10.71%, and 10.21%, respectively. In this regard, the projection area of the specimens increased nonlinearly by 6.06%, 4.26%, and 3.26%, respectively; whereas, true density decreased nonlinearly by 2.65%, 2.91%, and 1.90%, respectively. The maximum terminal velocity (12.41m/s) and Reynolds number (6,037.44) were observed in large kernels and the moisture content of 25%; whereas, the minimum terminal velocity (8.32m/s) and Reynolds number (3,016.55) were observed in small kernels and the moisture content of 10%. Maximum and minimum drag coefficients (1.014 vs. 0.302) were observed in small kernels at the moisture of 10% and large kernels at the moisture of 25%, respectively. The polynomial model was chosen as a suitable model in order to foretell the terminal velocity, Reynolds number, and drag coefficient of kernels as a function of moisture content and size. Practical Applications. Mechanical damages to seeds at harvesting, transporting, and threshing are major concerns for farmers and farming experts. All the processes of wind transfer, flotation, and seed removal from seed mixture and the stalks and husks depend on the behavior of the seeds in the wind flow. Therefore, it is crucial to determine the physical and aerodynamic properties of various crops to analyzing their behavior during transport, processing, and precise design of farm equipment and machines to minimize wastes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13858					FSTA:2022-03-Mc1315

R.; Fazilah Ariffin; Mohammadi Nafchi, A.; Nurul Huda; Jumardi Roslan							Characterization and cell viability of probiotic/prebiotics film based on duck feet gelatin: a novel poultry gelatin as a suitable matrix for probiotics.		Foods					The probiotic viability, physicochemical, mechanical, barrier, and microstructure properties of synbiotic edible films (SEFs) based on duck feet gelatin (DFG) were evaluated. Four synbiotic systems were obtained by mixing four types of prebiotics, namely, dextrin, polydextrose, gum Arabic, and sago starch, with DFG to immobilize of probiotic (Lactobacillus casei ATCC). The ability of DFG to create a suitable matrix to increase probiotic viability was compared with those of other commercial gelatins in a preliminary evaluation. The DFG showed proper probiotic viability compared with other gelatins. The addition of prebiotics reduced the transparency of SEFs and increased color differentiation, uniformity, and complete coverage of probiotic cells. The estimated shelf-life of surviving bacteria in the SEFs stored at 4 and 25 °C showed that gum arabic showed the best performance and enhanced the viability of L. casei by 42% and 45%, respectively. Dextrin, polydextrose, and sago starch enhanced the viability of L. casei at 4 and 25 °C by 26% and 35%, 26% and 5%, and 20% and 5%, respectively. The prebiotics improved the physicochemical, mechanical, and barrier properties of all SEFs, except polydextrose film. The viability of L. casei can be increased with the proper selection of gelatin and prebiotics. © 2021 by the authors.

Sazili							Effects of stocking and transport conditions on physicochemical properties of meat and acute-phase proteins in cattle.		Foods					This study's objective was to evaluate the effects of distance and stocking density on physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of meat and acute-phase proteins in Brahman crossbred cattle transported by road under hot and humid tropical conditions. Sixty Brahman crossbred heifers were subjected to road transport from a cattle feedlot farm located in Universiti Putra Malaysia (UPM), Serdang, to a commercial ruminant abattoir in Shah Alam, Selangor. Animals were assigned to long and short distances and high, medium, and low stocking densities. The results revealed that the intensity of response significantly increased in meat samples from animals subjected to long-distance transportation and higher stocking density. Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein and serum amyloid-A values increased considerably and were different from the baseline values recorded at preload. In conclusion, the current results revealed that the color, pH, shear force values, water holding capacity (WHC), glycogen level, and malondilaldehyde assay (MDA) concentrations in meat and acute-phase proteins (APP) were affected by both distances and stocking densities, as evidenced by the significant changes recorded from the parameters above. © 2021 by the authors.

Vitamin A and Daucuscarota root extract mitigate STZ-induced diabetic retinal degeneration in Wistar albino rats by modulating neurotransmission and downregulation of apoptotic pathways.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The objective of our study was to explore the deleterious effects of diabetes on the visual functions of the retina and to address whether the administration of vitamin A and carrot root extract (CE) confer retinal protection in hyperglycemic rats via modulation of oxidative stress, biochemical alternations, and retinal neurotransmission. Fifty male Wistar albino rats weighing 18012.41 g were randomized into five groups (n=10): controls, diabetic group (injected with 40 mg/kg dissolved in 0.1 sodium citrate buffer), diabetic group treated with vitamin A (2,500 IU/kg, low dose), diabetic group treated with vitamin (5,000 IU/kg, high dose), and diabetic groups administered CE (200 mg/kg/every other day). Our findings showed that, compared to controls, diabetic rats showed a significant decrease in their retinal thickness, increased apoptotic ganglion cells, and a noticeable degeneration of their synaptic layers. The inner retina displayed increased activity of neovascularization; however, the outer retina exhibited vacuolar degeneration of the photoreceptor cell layer. Our biochemical assessments showed reduced levels of CAT, SOD, and GST along with increased lipid peroxidation. Concurrently, cellular angiogenic and stress markers were significantly elevated associated with increased apoptotic activities as evidenced by increased expressions of annexin-V and PARP. Furthermore, the neurotransmitter content of the retina was altered in diabetic rats compared to controls and diabetic-treated groups. Paradoxically, vitamin A and CE supplementation attenuate these retinal insults in diabetic animals and normalized aforementioned assayed parameters; evidencing that both treatments exerted ameliorative impacts and restored visual functions by diminishing oxidative stress and neuronal degeneration. Practical applications. Diabetes is a complex disease that involves various physiological perturbations especially visual functions. In our study, we showed that vitamin A and carrot root extract (CE) confer remarkable protection against retinal degeneration in STZ-induced diabetic rats. Our findings showed that the chemical and phytochemical ingredients of the vitamin A and CE substantially attenuated the histopathological changes, oxidative stress, inflammatory reactions, and cellular death in diabetic rats. These favorable changes are attributable to the high content of retinoic acid, carotenoids, and phenolic compounds that effectively regulates the production of visual pigments, increases the antioxidant defense system, and diminishes the pro-inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Thus, the nutritional values of vitamin A and CE represent promising therapeutic choices to mitigate the retinal-induced diabetic insults. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13688					FSTA:2021-08-Jk10679
J		Ahmed Aj. Jabbar							Onosma mutabilis: phytochemical composition, antioxidant, cytotoxicity, and acute oral toxicity.		Food Science & Nutrition					The traditional use of Onosma L. species as a remedy motivated scientists to discover great biological/pharmacological potentials in this plant. In the current study, in addition to the phytochemical composition of methanol (MeOH), water, and ethyl acetate extract of aerial parts of Onosma mutabilis Boiss., an endemic plant species in the flora of Kurdistan, Iraq, in vitro antioxidant, cytotoxicity, and oral toxicity activity were investigated. Results of total phenolic and total flavonoid tests show the MeOH extract superiority, and the results of Gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometer (GS/GS-MS) show 18 chemical compounds in the MeOH extract, and the majority of the detected compounds were alkaloids (78.77%) and steroids (11.48%), namely as 5,8-dihydroxy-2-(4-methylpent-3-enyl) naphthalene-1,4-dione (48.60%), 3-O-Methyl-D-glucose (27.49%), beta-Sitosterol (6.81%), Phenol, 2,4-bis (1,1-dimethyl ethyl)-, phosphite (3.46%), and 24, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (3.14%). Results of the antioxidant tests show the MeOH extract superiority in the phosphomolybdenum assay, radical scavenging [on 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS)] assays, and reducing power [cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)] assays (1.45, 3.54, 2.33, 1.12, 1.62, mg/ml, respectively). The cytotoxicity results of the plant extract are presented as IC50 (inhibitory concentration at 50%) on the prostate cancer cells (DU-145), mammary cancer cells (MCF-7), and human cervix carcinoma (Hep2c), at which values ranged from 28.79 to 41.83 mug/ml. Results of the acute toxicity in the dose-dependent trail (100, 200, 300, 600 mg/kg of MeOH) show the absence of the behavior and appearance changes of female Wister rats. Overall, O. mutabilis extract exhibited significant natural potentials probably because of its polar phytochemicals, which could be an alternative source for remedial, nutrient, and cosmetic manufacture. © 2021 The Authors.

Meat quality, fatty acid content and NMR metabolic profile of dorper sheep supplemented with bypass fats.		Foods					The supplementation of rumen bypass fat (RBF) has remained one of the preferred approaches used to decrease undesirable saturated fatty acids (FA) and increase beneficial unsaturated FA in the meat. This study was planned to evaluate the influences of rumen bypass fats on meat quality, fatty acid and metabolic profiles in male Dorper sheep (n=36) with 24.660.76 kg (meanstandard error) initial body weight. Treatment comprised a basal diet (30:70 rice straw to concentrate) with no added RBF as a control (CON), basal diet with prilled fat (PF), basal diet with prilled fat plus lecithin (PFL) and basal diet with calcium soap of palm fatty acids (CaS). The findings revealed that cooking loss, drip loss and shear force in longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle were not affected by RBF supplementation, while meat pH was significantly higher in the CaS on aging day 1. However, the diet supplemented with prilled fat and lecithin modified the meat's fatty acid profile significantly by increasing unsaturated fatty acids and decreasing saturated fats. The relative quantification of the major differentiating metabolites found in LD muscle of sheep showed that total cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, choline, glycerophosphocholine and glycerophospholipids were significantly lower in CaS and PFL diets, while glycerol and sphingomyelin were significantly higher in CaS and PFL diets. Most of the metabolites in the liver did not show any significant difference. Based on our results, the supplementation of protected fats did not have a negative influence on meat quality and the meat from Dorper sheep fed prilled fat with lecithin contained more healthy fatty acids compared to other diets. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ahmed Junejo, S.; Alam Rashid; Liping Yang; Yan Xu; Supaluck Kraithong; Yibin Zhou							Effects of spinach powder on the physicochemical and antioxidant properties of durum wheat bread.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					An adequate intake of dietary fiber in baked foods with appropriate physiological functions is beneficial to human health. The spinach powder (1, 2, and 3 g/100 g) was supplemented with refined wheat flour to investigate its effect on physicochemical and antioxidant properties of bread. The mixing, pasting, and rheological properties of dough, as well as physical, antioxidant, and sensory properties of bread were analyzed. Results Showed that water absorption%, stability and development time, protein weakening, and starch crystallinity of spinach samples increased to 62.40%, 5.92/min, 2.05/min, 0.76 Nm, and 0.21 Nm. The peak viscosity, final viscosity, setback, and breakdown values were significantly decreased to 2205.71, 2485.05, 1122.74, and 843.36 cP, respectively. Samples exhibited the highest elastic (218017 Pa) and viscous (94257.76 Pa) moduli and the lowest specific volume (3.12 cm3/g), color attributes, and sensorial properties. Furthermore, breads stored for different periods showed the minimum hardness (4151.67 N), chewiness (826.33 N), and resilience (0.08) compared to control. In addition, the 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, ferric reducing antioxidant power, and 2,2′-azino-bis 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid properties were also significantly improved in corresponding samples. Findings suggest that incorporating spinach into wheat flour could be a viable approach to produce healthy bread enriched with fiber, protein, and antioxidants.

J		Ahmed M. Hammad; Amira Eltahan; Eman Khalifa; Nasser H. Abbas; Shimamoto, T.							Toxigenic potential of Bacillus cereus strains isolated from retail dairy products in Egypt.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Little is known about the virulence in Bacillus cereus strains isolated from retail dairy products in the Middle East and particularly from Egypt. In this study, the occurrence of B. cereus in 290 samples of dairy products (raw milk, Ras cheese, pasteurized extended shelf life [ESL] milk) collected from retail shops was investigated. The potential of 126 selected isolates of B. cereus to possess genes encoding nonhemolytic enterotoxin, hemolysin BL, and cytotoxin K (cytK), and to grow at 7°C was verified. The highest occurrence of B. cereus was found in raw milk (85%, 85/100) followed by Ras cheese (10%, 10/100) and ESL milk samples (8.8%, 8/90). A large proportion of the B. cereus isolates from raw milk (48.9%, 48/99) and Ras cheese (71.4%, 10/14) had at least one complete set of toxin genes (nhe or hbl). Enterotoxin genes, nheA, nheB, nheC, hblA, hblD, and hblC, were detected in 38.4% (5/13), 53.8% (7/13), 61.5% (8/13), 46.1% (6/13), 46.1% (6/13), and 23.1% (3/13) of ESL milk isolates, respectively. cytK was identified in 42.4% (42/99), 50% (7/14), and 46.2% (6/13) of raw milk, Ras cheese, and ESL milk isolates, respectively. The psychrotrophic ability was observed in 22.2% and 15.3% of isolates recovered from raw milk and ESL milk, respectively. The toxigenic potential of B. cereus strains described in this study may pose a health risk to the consumer and, therefore, the presence of these bacteria in retail dairy products should be monitored to ensure consumers' safety.										2021	18	9	655	660	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2920					FSTA:2022-02-Pa0551

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The aim of the work was to study the effect of adding cucumber pomace powder (CP) to soft wheat flour used in noodle manufacture. CP is a rich source of minerals and fibres, having high contents of polyphenols and flavonoids were 1.6 mg g-1 GAE and 0.65 mg g-1 QE, respectively, besides its capability to inhibit bacterial and fungal growth and to scavenge DPPH (74.44%). The dough rheological properties showed increased extensibility and water absorption but decreased elasticity with adding CP. CP addition significantly increased the mineral and polyphenols content in noodles, but decreased protein and carbohydrates. Noodles enriched with CP 6% have the best organoleptic properties and overall acceptability and were associated with high levels of essential minerals, reduced cooking time by 44% over the control and better nutritional value. No deteriorative changes in dried noodles occurred during 12 months. Cooked noodles enriched with CP 6% significantly reduced the microbial load. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3255	3268	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14970					FSTA:2021-10-Mq6400
J		Ahmed M. Saad; Alaa S. Mohamed; El-Saadony, M. T.; Mahmoud Z. Sitohy							Palatable functional cucumber juices supplemented with polyphenols-rich herbal extracts.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to produce a palatable functional cucumber juice: non-supplemented cucumber juice, control juice (J-con), and supplemented with different herbal extracts. Four juices were prepared and evaluated, as supplemented with the ethanolic extracts of cinnamon, mint, ginger, and clove denoting as; J-cin, J-min, J-gin, and J-clov, respectively as compared to J-con. HPLC analysis indicated that J-clov followed by J-min were the richest juices in the phenolic and flavonoid compounds compared to control. Pyrogallol, catechin, gallic, and chlorogenic acid were the most prominent phenolics in J-clov, while hesperidin and apigenin-6-arabinose were the most abundant flavonoids. Clove extract showed the highest (p ≤ 0.05) antioxidant activity (80%), followed by the mint extract. Clove and mint extracts significantly reduced the growth of the tested bacteria and fungi. The antioxidant activities in all juices significantly (p ≤ 0.05) decreased during the storage period (0, 2, 4, and 6 months) at 25 °C as polyphenols and flavonoids content declined. The pH and vitamin C significantly decreased; however, the titratable acidity increased. Clove and mint extracts (p ≤ 0.05) reduced the decay of total sugars by reducing the microbial load. J-clov showed the highest sensorial taste and flavor scores; however, J-min and J-cin were the best colors.

J		Ahmed Mahros, M.; Abd-Elghany, S. M.; Ibrahim Sallam, K.							Multidrug-, methicillin-, and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolated from ready-to-eat meat sandwiches: an ongoing food and public health concern.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and their antimicrobial resistance pose exacerbating global health threats and endangering everyone. Thus, the prevalence, molecular characterization of virulence genes, and antimicrobial resistance patterns of strains isolated from 225 beef burger and hot dog sandwiches vended in Mansoura city, Egypt were determined. 83.1% of the sandwiches tested were contaminated with coagulase-positive S. aureus, with a mean count of 4 * 103 CFU/g. Genes encoding mecA, alpha-hemolysin, staphylococcal enterotoxins, and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 were detected in 22.6%, 96.3%, 61.1%, and 0% of the strains isolated, respectively. Of the 190 coagulase-positive strains, 43 (22.6%) were confirmed as MRSA. Among them, 4 strains (2.1%) were vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA) and resistant to all antimicrobials tested. Interestingly, all isolates were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobials tested, with 75.2% being multi-drug resistant (MDR) and an average multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) index of 0.503. Not less important, 100%, 96.3%, 90.5%, 79.5%, 73.7%, 62.6%, and 48.9% of isolates were resistant to Kanamycin, Nalidixic acid, Cefotaxime, Sulphamethoxazole-Trimethoprim, Penicillin G, Tetracycline, and Cephalothin, respectively. The potential hazard of MDR-, MRSA-, and VRSA-contaminated sandwiches may be an indication of the presence of what is more dangerous. Hence, strict hygienic measures and good standards of food handler's personal hygiene to prevent transmission of these pathogens to consumers are imperative.

Gum Arabic (GA) was supplemented in three levels (0.1, 0.5, and 1%, w/w) while fat was simultaneously reduced at 25, 50, and 75% (w/v) during the preparation of 100% gluten-free quinoa cakes (GFQCs). A coupling effect of 1% GA and 50% lower fat was successfully applied to inhibit AA up to 83%, fat oxidation up to 64%, and browning intensity up to 59.1% without impairing the baking performance. Moreover, supplementation of 1% GA produced softer and lighter QFQCs, which was similar to 100% wheat cakes. The odor intensity detected by electronic nose technique was also lowered in QFQCs. Consequently, the current work serves the worldwide demand for gluten-free bakery products having healthier profile with low fat oxidation and AA formation.

Abdulkareem; Abolfazl Akbari							The combination of ginger powder and zinc supplement improves the fructose-induced metabolic syndrome in rats by modulating the hepatic expression of NF-kappaB, mTORC1, PPAR-alpha SREBP-1c, and Nrf2.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Although studies have shown that ginger, as an herbal remedy and zinc are able to improve inflammation, oxidative stress, autophagy, and metabolism of lipid and glucose, their molecular mechanisms are unknown. Therefore, this study was aimed to examine the therapeutic effects of ginger with zinc supplement for eight weeks on fructose-induced metabolic syndrome (MS). Ninety-six adult male Sprague Dawley rats (220 g20) were randomly assigned to twelve controlled and treated groups. After the last treatment session, the level of lipid profiles, glucose, insulin, and leptin as metabolic factors and liver enzymes as biomarkers to evaluate liver function in serum were measured. The level of antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation to evaluate the oxidative status and the TNF-alpha level as a biomarker to assess the state of inflammation in liver were also measured. The level of zinc along with the expression of NF-kappaB, mTORC1, PPAR-alpha, SREBP-1c, and Nrf2 in liver was also evaluated. The level of metabolic factors and liver enzymes in serum along with lipid peroxidation and TNF-alpha in liver increased; zinc and antioxidant enzymes levels decreased in rats with MS compared to control rats (p<.05). The hepatic expression of SREBP-1c, NF-kappaB and mTORC1 were upregulated and the expression of PPAR-alpha and Nrf2 were downregulated in rats with MS compared to control rats (p<.05). Treatment with different doses of ginger, zinc, and the combination of them could improve metabolic, inflammatory oxidative stress factors, and expression of the above genes in rats with MS compared to the MS group (p<.05). It can be concluded that ginger, zinc, and the combination of them could improve oxidative damage, inflammation, and autophagy induced by fructose and could adjust the glucose and lipid metabolism and the homeostasis of zinc in rats with MS. Practical applications. Due to the increasing prevalence of metabolic diseases, the use of plant compounds such as ginger has attracted widespread attention. Ginger as an herbal remedy with predominant pharmacological properties due to its availability, cheapness, and lack of side effects is also very popular for the treatment of metabolic disorders in folk medicine. Moreover, enhancing its medicinal properties with supplements such as zinc can be widely welcomed. This study was actually performed with the aim of investigating the effects of ginger+ zinc supplement on MS. The results showed that the ginger+ zinc supplement could improve oxidative damage, inflammation, and autophagy caused by fructose and adjust the glucose and lipid metabolism and the homeostasis of zinc in rats with MS. The results of this study support the hypothesis that ginger can be used as a very suitable option for the production of medicinal supplements to maintain human health. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Ahmed Nasef, N.; Peter Zhu; Golding, M.; Anant Dave; Ajmol Ali; Harjinder Singh; Manohar Garg							Salmon food matrix influences digestion and bioavailability of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids.		Food & Function					The natural structure of whole food plays an important role in the physiological impact of bioactive compounds present within the food, also known as the "matrix effect". Long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3PUFAs) are one example of a food-derived nutrient, mostly found in fish, that is believed to be influenced by the food matrix. However, most previous studies have compared only the long-term bioavailability of fish versus fish oil and have used commercial sources of fish oil. The present study aimed to investigate whether fish (salmon) matrix influences the transit of LCn-3PUFAs during in vitro digestion and affects bioavailability in healthy females. Meals containing intact salmon (intact structure), minced salmon (some structure) and defatted salmon+ oil (no structure) with identical macronutrient compositions were developed. Healthy female participants (n=13) consumed the meals in a postprandial crossover study and blood was collected at regular time points for 6 h post meal consumption. In parallel, in vitro digestion of the meals was performed using a human gastric simulator (HGS) and digesta samples were collected at regular time points for 6 h. Results. showed that plasma concentration of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) were significantly higher after participants consumed intact salmon compared to the other meals (covariate analysis p< 0.001). The in vitro digestion results showed defatted salmon+ oil meal had a faster decrease in pH and faster fat emptying from the HGS than the other two meals. The defatted salmon+ oil meal more closely followed fat emptying of a homogeneous unstructured meal, whereas the other meals exhibited phase separation with a delay in fat emptying. Conclusion. The fish matrix (salmon) plays an important role in the bioaccessibility and bioavailability of EPA and DHA. The differences are partly explained by fat digestion and emptying from the stomach. This study suggests that the natural structure of fish has a functional effect on the absorption and bioavailability of fish oil. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Phytoprostanes from date palm fruit and byproducts: five different varieties grown in two different locations as potential sources.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Date palm fruit has been considered for centuries as an ancient nutritional constituent in the human diet. Recently, global trade in dates increased at an average that, simultaneously, will be accompanied by an increase in date palm byproducts. Supported by date phytochemicals and their health benefits, the aim of this work is to evaluate for the first time the presence of special metabolites of plant called phytoprostanes (PhytoPs) in five different varieties of the Phoenix dactylifera L. pulps and pits using a microLC-ESI-QTrap-MS/MS methodology. Results obtained showed the interest of using these matrices as potential sources of several PhytoPs (ent-16-B1-PhytoP; ent-9-L1-PhytoP; and epimers of ent-16-F1t-PhytoP and of 9-F1t-PhytoP). The variation in concentration between different varieties and different DPF parts was also evaluated. Results obtained will help to unravel the biological activities associated with DPF consumption that could be related to these bioactive metabolites.		; selim, samy/C-4258-2015	S.Ahmed, Omar/0000-0002-3002-0964; selim, samy/0000-0003-4025-8586							2021	69	46	13754	13761	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03364					FSTA:2022-03-Jg3902
J		Ahmed R. A. Hammam; Martinez-Monteagudo, S. I.; Metzger, L. E.; Khalid A. Alsaleem							Effect of ultrasound intensity on the functional characteristics of rennet-coagulated skim milk.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The objective of this study was to examine the impact of ultrasound energy density (USED) on the functional properties of rennet-coagulated skim milk. Skim pasteurized milk was ultrasonicated at 106W and 375W at two different times (3 and 9 min) to produce different USED levels (190.4, 570.7, 674.3, and 2016.9 Jg-1). The rheological and textural properties of ultrasonicated milk samples were determined during the rennet coagulation as compared to nonsonicated skim milk. The rennet coagulation time was doubled when 674.3 Jg-1 was applied to skim milk; however, applying 2016.9 Jg-1 did not lead to milk coagulation. Additionally, gel firmness of rennet-coagulated milk increased significantly from 80g to 130g when USED boosted from 190.4 to 674.3 Jg-1. The coagulum strength and curd-firming rate decreased significantly when USED elevated to 2016.9 Jg-1. The outcome provides that using suitable USED could be utilized efficiently in the cheese industry to prolong the renneting time of milk. Practical Applications. The ultrasound process can be applied to milk before making different dairy products, such as cheese or other dairy products that need rennet for coagulation to improve the characteristics of those products. Also, ultrasound can be utilized to fractionate dairy components to improve the functionality or yield of products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	9			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13800					FSTA:2021-12-Pa6889

Potential of rosmarinic acid to ameliorate toxic effects of diethyl methoxy thio-phosphoryl thio-succinate on albino Wistar rats' lung, mast cell infiltration inhibitory pathway.		Food Science & Nutrition					Malathion (MA) is a widely used pesticide in agriculture. It can cause toxicity in different organs of the body. Rosmarinic acid (RO) is found in rosemary extract that can be absorbed through gastrointestinal tract mucosa with potent antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory potential. The current study is designed to investigate the potential of RO to protect the lung after MA administration. Forty albino rats were allocated equally to four groups. C-group received corn oil. RO-group received RO orally. MA-group received MA. MA-RO-group received RO in addition to MA. After three weeks the lungs were dissected for histopathological and biochemical investigations. MA-group showed manifestations of severe inflammation with inflammatory cells infiltration in the lung. MA-RO-group showed limited inflammatory cell infiltration. C-group and RO-group appeared with weak anti-survivin immunoreactivity. MA-group showed strong positive immunoreactivity. The reactivity was weakly positive in MA-RO-group. MA-group showed a significant decrease in SP-D gene expression in comparison to the C-group, in addition, MA-RO-group showed a significant increase in SP-D expression. In conclusion, the current study approves that oral administration of MA causes lung injury as it has inflammatory effects, caused by oxidative stress and reports the potential of RO to protect lung tissue against toxic effects of MA through its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and anti-apoptotic potential. © 2021 The Authors.

Suitability of data-collection methods, tools, and metrics for evaluating market food environments in low- and middle-income countries.		Foods					Globalization is transforming food environments in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) with implications for diets and nutrition. However, most food-environment assessments were developed for use in high-income countries. We evaluated the suitability of 113 data-collection assessments (i.e., methods, tools, and metrics) for eight dimensions of informal and formal market food environments for diverse contexts of LMICs. We used a scoring exercise and a survey of experts (n = 27). According to the scoring exercise, 10 assessments (8methods, 1 tool, and 1metric) were suitable without modification for informal markets. Suitability for formal markets was markedly higher, with 41 assessments (21methods, 14 tools, and 6metrics) found suitable without modification. Experts considered availability, accessibility, price, and affordability the most important dimensions of market food environments to evaluate in LMICs. Market-basket analysis and vendor audits (which include inventories) were ranked as the most suitable methods to assess multiple dimensions of market food environments, including availability, price, affordability, vendor and product characteristics, marketing, and regulation. Gaps in relevant assessments were found for convenience and desirability. Results demonstrate the need for the development, adaptation, and validation of assessments relevant for informal markets in a diverse range of LMIC contexts to support diets, nutrition, and health globally. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ahmed Sadiq, F.; Flint, S.							Dairy strains of Anoxybacillus flavithermus inhibit lipase production by Geobacillus stearothermophilus.		International Dairy Journal					In this study, we demonstrated lipase inhibition in two genetically distinct dairy strains of Geobacillus stearothermophilus caused by two dairy strains of Anoxybacillus flavithermus as a result of their growth in coculture, where no effect on the growth of G. stearothermophilus strains was noted. Further investigation showed that cell-free supernatant (CFS) of A. flavithermus strains has potential to completely inhibit bacterial ability to produce lipases, rather than affecting the activity of lipases, by all strains of G. stearothermophilus by an unknown mechanism and possibly due to the substance that became completely inactivated after heating the CFS at 100 °C for 30 and 60 min. The same lipase inhibition effect of CFS from the A. flavithermus strains was confirmed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 10145 as well. This study reports a novel process, yet unknown, by which A. flavithermus strains are able to inhibit lipase production in two distantly related species.

J		Ahmed Wani, T.; Masoodi, F. A.; Rehana Akhter							Preparation and characterization of chitosan flake and chitosan nanopowder gels: a comparative study of rheological, thermal and morphological perspectives.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Chitosan flakes (CF) were modified to chitosan nanopowder (CP), using planetary ball milling for 8 h. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed the nano size of CP. Least gelation capacity (LGC) of CF (3%) and CP (4%) was manipulated to fabricate gels with 1.5, 2, and 3 fold increase in LGC. The total color difference was higher in CP than CF gels and depended on concentration. Dynamic rheometry under temperature ramping (20-80 °C and 80-20 °C) showed stable viscoelasticity. Besides, optimal structural network was observed in CP8 and CF6. During temperature ramping, the damping factor (tan delta) for all the gels was >0.1 < 1, which confirmed the elastic behavior of the gels. Power law model revealed maximum shear thinning behavior in CP8 and CF6. Rapid increase in temperature of gels during thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and high temperature differential scanning calorimetry (HDSC) revealed more thermal stability in CP than CF gels. The interconnecting gap of polymer gel matrix revealed through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was higher in CF than in CP gels. In conclusion, the CP gels have comparable rheology but better thermal and matrix properties that could be explored for food and pharmaceutical applications.

Subcritical treatment of olive oil: minor phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of the solvent extracts.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Olive oil extracted from four exotic olive cultivars was subjected to subcritical treatment using green and organic solvents. The minor phenolic compounds were identified and quantified by RP-HPLC-DAD. Significant (p≤0.05) variation in the phenolic compounds and antioxidant properties was observed with respect to cultivar, solvent and the extraction conditions. For the methanolic and ethanolic extracts, the antioxidant properties generally increased upon subcritical treatment but decreased drastically for subcritical water extraction. Besides correlation among hydroxytyrosol, tyrosol and oleuropein, the multivariate analysis revealed high correlation of antioxidant properties with hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, tyrosol and apigenin. The principal components analysis (PCA) revealed two components explaining 86.6% variability. PCA separated aqueous and organic solvents both at ambient and subcritical conditions in the score plot. The loading plot exhibited maximum positive loadings of the analyses. It is concluded that subcritical water extraction could be manipulated for the recovery of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol from olive oil.

Eid							Role of dietary selenium in alleviating bisphenol A toxicity of liver albino rats: histological, ultrastructural, and biomarker assessments.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Bisphenol A (BPA) is used as a plasticizer in polycarbonate plastics. It has been used in consumer products and epoxy resins for decades as protective coatings and linings for food and beverage bottles. This can trigger human reactions to BPA which interferes with estrogen receptors. Our study explored the ameliorative effects of selenium (Se) in male rats on liver damage caused by BPA. Rats were divided into four groups at random: The first one obtained olive oil and acted as a control. Se (0.5 mg/kg diet) was given for the second group. The third one was treated with BPA (10 mg/kg body weight/day) orally. Concomitantly Se (0.5 mg/kg diet) and BPA (10 mg/kg body weight/day) were given orally in the fourth one. Liver specimens were prepared for light, electron microscopes and the serum samples were screened for biochemical markers. In the BPA received group, histological findings indicated apoptotic hepatic histological changes such as sinusoidal congestion, cytoplasmic vacuolation and leukocyte infiltration. Ultrastructurally, the same group had mitochondrial degeneration, rough endoplasmic reticulum swelling, and nuclear pyknosis, as well as fat droplet deposition and lysosome enhancement. Liver enzymes: In the BPA group, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) have been substantially increased. Moreover, histological and ultrastructural improvements were seen in the rat population treated with BPA and Se, whereas ALT and AST levels were lowered and malondialdehyde (MDA), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), human C reactive protein (hCRP), and the serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) were significantly modulated. Practical applications. Bisphenol A (BPA) is used in the manufacturing of polycarbonate plastic (e.g., water bottles, baby bottles) and epoxy resins (e.g., inner coating in metallic food cans). It is a non-polymer preservative for other plastics, one of the contaminants of the atmosphere and a common endocrine estrogenic disruptor. Our study explored the ameliorative effects of selenium (Se) in male rats on liver damage caused by BPA. Rats were divided into four groups at random: The first one obtained olive oil and acted as a control. Se (0.5 mg/kg diet) was given for the second group. The third one was treated with BPA (10 mg/kg body weight/day) orally. Concomitant Se (0.5 mg/kg diet) and BPA (10 mg/kg body weight/day) were given in the fourth one.

Phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (31P NMR) for quantitative measurements of phospholipids derived from natural products: effect of analysis conditions.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present study the running conditions (sample pH, scan number, relaxation delay and NMR solvent) for the quantification of phospholipids by 31P NMR using commercial pure standards were optimised. A mixture of pure standards was run at different pH (7.3, 7.8, 9.5 and 12), scan numbers (64, 128, 192 and 512), relaxation delay times (1s, 2s, 3.5s and 10s) and NMR solvents (D2O/EDTA/sodium cholate or CDCl3/CD3OD/EDTA) to achieve this goal. Best 31P NMR conditions were found to be pH 7.3, a scan number of 192 and a relaxation delay of 3.5s, which were used for the quantification of natural samples (Krill oil, soybean lecithin and egg phospholipid) in D2O/EDTA/sodium cholate or CDCl3/CD3OD/EDTA. Phospholipids and lysophospholipids were highly resolved and detected in D2O/EDTA/sodium cholate compared to CDCl3/CD3OD/EDTA. A number of phospholipids (lysophoshatidylglycerol-2, LPG-2; lysophosphatidylethanolamine, LPE; N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine, APE) were not detected in CDCl3/CD3OD/EDTA, but they were detected in D2O/EDTA/sodium cholate. Therefore, it is concluded that D2O/EDTA/sodium cholate is a better detection solvent for 31P NMR quantification of phospholipids extracted from natural sources. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Physicochemical characteristics, antioxidant activity, and acceptability of strawberry-enriched ketchup sauces.		Food Chemistry					The addition of strawberry pulp to ketchup sauces may be an alternative to attend the consumers' demand for innovative products with functional appeal. Sauces were made using different tomato/strawberry pulp ratios (100:0; 75:25; 50:50; 25:75; 0:100) and characterized for the physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity, and consumers' acceptance. The strawberry-enriched ketchup sauces presented higher phenolics, total flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and increased fluidity, and lower browning index, hue angle, chroma, pH, and Bostwick consistency. The antioxidant activities (ABTS and DPPH) were positively correlated with phenolics (r=0.96 and 0.91) and flavonoids (r=0.92 and 0.89) contents, respectively. The replacement of up to 50% tomato pulp by strawberry pulp did not change the acidity, flavor, and overall acceptance of the samples. The strawberry pulp has proven to be an effective alternative to increase the concentrations of bioactive compounds while reducing the amount of sugar used in traditional ketchup formulations.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Marine products are important food resources for humans, as they contain high-quality protein as well as nutrients. With the rapid development of the marine food industry, large amounts of by-products are produced, underutilized, and even cause serious environmental problems. Marine by-products consist of the head, viscera, skin, blood, and bones, containing many nutritious biomolecules, such as proteins, vitamins, minerals, polyunsaturated fatty acids, lipids, and carotenoids. These bio compounds have potential applications in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food industries. Thus, the recovery of bioactive compounds from marine by-products through non-thermal processing methods, including pulsed electric field (PEF), dense phase carbon dioxide (DPCD), high hydrostatic pressure (HHP), membrane technology, ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE), and enzyme-assisted extraction methods, was discussed. The non-thermal technologies showed more promising results for recovering bioactive compounds from marine by-products than conventional methods considering the yield and quality in terms of energy and time costs, so these non-thermal technologies could also improve food security and reduce associated environmental problems. However, these emerging non-thermal technologies are still in the development stage, and broad industrial applications require more studies and practical industrial transfer to establish specific processing methods for obtaining certain bioactive compounds from marine by-products.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Broccoli sprouts are rich in secondary metabolites, especially glucosinolates (GLs). The synthesis of GLs can be modified by light. In this study, extractive electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (EESI-MS) was used to analyze the broccoli sprouts extracts (BSE) under different light quality treatments. Multivariable statistical methods were used to analyze the difference of different light quality treatments. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to analyze the gene expression of key enzymes in the aliphatic-GLs biosynthesis pathway. Nineteen compounds, including 7 GLs, 3 phenolic acids, 6 amino acids and 3 organic acids were simultaneously detected in one minute by EESI-MS. Relative expression of MYB28, BCAT4, CYP79F1, CYP83A1 and AOP3 were mostly upregulated in R5B5 (light ratios of red/blue 5:5) treatment. These findings suggest that blue light improving the accumulation of secondary metabolites in broccoli sprouts, and the R5B5 treatment was most beneficial. Furthermore, we established EESI-MS method to simultaneous and rapid detection of secondary metabolites in broccoli sprouts, especially GLs. This study could provide a reference for selecting proper LED lighting conditions to produce broccoli sprouts with high content of bioactive components, and provides light regulation technology and theoretical basis for the industrialized production of sprouts.

J		Ahuir-Baraja, A. E.; Llobat, L.; Garijo, M. M.							Effectiveness of gutting blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou, Risso, 1827), in Spanish supermarkets as an anisakidosis safety measure.		Foods					Anisakidosis is a parasitic zoonotic disease which can cause gastroallergic reactions in humans. In 2010, the European Food Safety Agency estimated that approximately 20,000 cases of anisakiasis had been reported across the world, with Spain having the highest number of infections in Europe. The blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou, Risso, 1827) is one of the most widely fished species worldwide and represents around 25% of the white fish eaten in Spain. The Spanish Food Safety Authority requires obligatory evisceration of certain fish species before commercialization, but not for blue whiting. Nevertheless, some supermarkets carry this out themselves to prevent human infections and negative customer reactions deriving from the presence of ascaridoid larvae. To assess the effectiveness of eviscerations at supermarkets, a total of 320 blue whiting specimens were examined. The risk of larval migration from the visceral cavity to the musculature in gutted and ungutted fish was also assessed. Our results showed a total prevalence (25%) of ascaridoids in fish gutted at the supermarket, and a direct relationship was found between the presence of larvae in the muscle and time until evisceration. In ungutted fish, the standard length and weight were higher for infected than for non-infected fish. Also, massive infections had a higher prevalence in these larger specimens, in which the viability of larvae was also high. Larval viability was not found to be affected by a 24-h refrigeration period. Anisakis was the most prevalent genus identified in the fish examined. The results indicate that gutting at the supermarket is not an effective method for the total removal of ascaridoid larvae and that additional safety measures are advisable. © 2021 by the authors.

IngID: a framework for parsing and systematic reporting of ingredients used in commercially packaged foods.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					There is lack of information in the scientific literature on types of ingredients used in packaged foods. USDA's Global Branded Food Products Database makes publicly available a compiled dataset of ingredient lists for over a quarter million commercial food products. This paper reports on the development of a framework for parsing and systematic reporting of ingredients used in commercially packaged foods (IngID) in the US and delineates the complexity and challenges of current ingredient lists, using baked products to illustrate. The major steps in the development of IngID prototype were 1) identifying top-selling baked products, 2) obtaining their ingredient lists, 3) parsing individual ingredients after several pre-processing steps as ingredient lists were inconsistent and varied, 4) building a thesaurus by assigning a preferred descriptor to equivalent terms such as synonyms and spelling errors, and 5) assigning broader terms such as flour, sweeteners. The current version of IngID includes 3 main files-an input Food details file, an output file of parsed text strings, and a thesaurus of ~6500 parsed ingredients. IngID can help improve our understanding of commercial ingredients, characterizing foods in dimensions other than the traditional nutrient profiles, development of food ontology, computer programs and artificial intelligence tools.

Effect of leaf-to-fruit ratios on phenolic and sensory profiles of Malbec wines from single high-wire-trellised vineyards.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The single high-wire system is a free canopy trellis system suitable for warm to hot climates. In a global warming scenario, it arouses as a technological solution since it prevents berry overheating and sunburn. Canopy management practices manipulate leaf-to-fruit ratios, affecting berry and wine composition. We aimed to evaluate the phenolic and sensory profiles of Malbec wines from single high-wire trellised vineyards in a hot region in Mendoza (Argentina) and to assess the effect of varying leaf-to-fruit ratios on these attributes. We manipulated leaf-to-fruit ratios by varying shoot trimming (experiment 1: 0.45m, 0.80m, and untrimmed) and winter pruning severity (experiment 2: 16, 24, 32, and >32 countable buds per meter). We characterized wine attributes by a descriptive analysis, color by the CIELAB space, and global phenolics compounds and anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection. Results. We found that wines where shoots were trimmed to 0.80m or left untrimmed had similar and greater intensity of color, violet hue, astringency, and alcohol and a richer aroma profile than wines where shoots were trimmed to 0.45m. Meanwhile, wines from 16 and >32 buds/m treatments (the latter simulating a box pruning) were similar to each other and had higher color intensity, violet hue, acidity, alcohol, and astringency and a more complex aroma profile than the other pruning treatments. Conclusions. The best quality wines were achieved by leaving 16 or >32 buds/m and by trimming shoots to 0.80m or leaving them untrimmed. The modulation of cultural practices in sprawling canopies offers the potential to produce wines with different styles in hot regions. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Food Chemistry					The black tea could be stored for a long time, and subsequently affects the flavor characteristics. In the present study, the effects of storage years (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 17 and 20 years) on the chemical profiling and taste quality of keemun black tea (KBT) were compared by metabolomics and quantitative sensory evaluation. The main polyphenols were degraded during the storing, especially 10-year storage, but caffeine and theobromine were stable. The intensity of bitterness, astringency, umami was negatively correlated to storage years, with correlation coefficient at -0.95, -0.91 and -0.83 respectively, whereas sweetness had positive correlation coefficient at 0.74. Quinic acid, galloylated catechins, linolenic acid, linoleic acid, malic acid, palamitic acid, and theaflavin-3-gallate were marker compounds which were responsible for distinguishing short and long time preserved KBT. The contents of fatty acids were positively correlated to storage time and sweet intensity.

Foods					Aristolochic acid (AA) toxicity has been shown in humans regarding carcinogenesis, nephrotoxicity, and mutagenicity. Monitoring the AA content in drug homologous and healthy foods is necessary for the health of humans. In this study, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) with high sensitivity for aristolochic acid I (AA-I) was prepared. Based on the obtained mAb, a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLEIA) against AA-I was developed, which showed the 50% decrease in the RLUmax (IC50) value of 1.8 ng/mL and the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.4 ng/mL. Carbon dots with red emission at 620 nm, namely rCDs, were synthesized and employed in conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (icELISA) to improve the assay sensitivity of a fluoroimmunoassay (FIA). Oxidized 3, 3′′, 5,5′′-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (oxTMB) can quench the emission of the rCDs through the inner-filter effect; therefore, the fluorescence intensity of rCDs can be regulated by the concentration of mAb. As a result, the assay sensitivity of FIA was improved by five-fold compared to CLEIA. A good relationship between the results of the proposed assays and the standard ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-QQQ-MS/MS) of real samples indicated good accuracy and practicability of CLEIA and FIA. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of AOAC International					Background. A large amount of blueberry pomace is discarded and wasted. Objective. To make full use of blueberry pomace and extract anthocyanins. Method. Multi-frequency ultrasound was used to extract anthocyanins from blueberry pomace. The effects of different extraction conditions on the anthocyanin yields were studied. The antioxidant activity of anthocyanins was evaluated, and the main anthocyanin components were identified by HPLC-electrospray ionization (ESI)-MS/MS. Results. The optimal anthocyanin extraction conditions were as follows: dual-frequency ultrasound of 40+80kHz, ultrasonic power of 350W, extraction temperature of 50 °C, and extraction time of 40min. Compared with single frequency (25kHz) and tri-frequency ultrasound (25+40+80kHz), the anthocyanin yield with dual-frequency ultrasound increased by 15.26% and 5.45% respectively. Furthermore, the antioxidant activities (DPPH, hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, and reducing power) of anthocyanins extracted with dual-frequency ultrasound were all higher than those without ultrasound. Seven kinds of anthocyanins were identified by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Conclusions. Dual-frequency ultrasound had a higher extraction yield than single frequency ultrasound, tri-frequency ultrasound, and no ultrasound. Highlights Dual-frequency ultrasonic technology provides an effective approach for improving the extraction yield of anthocyanins from blueberry pomace. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

J		Ai-Jun Xie; Dong-Jin Lee; Seung-Taik Lim							Characterization of resistant waxy maize dextrins prepared by simultaneous debranching and crystallization followed by acidic or enzymatic hydrolysis.		Food Hydrocolloids					Resistant dextrins (RD) were prepared by simultaneous debranching and crystallization with waxy maize starch at 50°C for 7 days, followed by the hydrolysis using an acid (3.16 M sulfuric acid) or alpha-amylase (5% based on starch solids) for 24 h. The crystallinity, thermal transition, morphology, and in vitro digestibility of the hydrolyzed RDs were analyzed. The RD hydrolysates showed typical A-type crystalline patterns under X-ray diffraction with increases in crystallinity and thermal stability compared to the unhydrolyzed counterparts. The RD crystals were obtained as nano-sized particles by the hydrolysis, which readily aggregated while drying. Based on the in vitro digestibility test, the enzyme-resistant fraction of the hydrolyzed RDs was greater than the unhydrolyzed one by 5-10%. Heating in a boiling water-bath (15 min) decreased the enzyme-resistant fraction to less than 50%, while the hydrolysis raised the fraction by 10-15%. The hydrolysis could be used in the preparation of nano-sized RD with increased crystallinity and resistance to the digestion.

Food Research International					To clarify the discrepancy in characteristic flavor and bacteria composition of 10 fresh fermented rice noodles from southern China, the volatile and bacteria composition were determined by headspace-gas chromatography ion mobility spectrometry and 16SrRNA sequencing methods. The potential relationship between volatile compounds and bacterial composition has also been further revealed using spearman's correlation analysis. The contents of proximate composition, cooking properties and texture properties of 10 fresh fermented rice noodles exhibited significant different among them (p< 0.05). The flavor analysis showed that a total of 54 compounds were detected. 1-Octen-one, ethyl 3-methylbutanoate, 3-methylbutanal, n-nonanal, hexanal, amyl acetate, ethanol and 2-pentyl furan were the key volatiles among them. The bacterial analysis showed that Leuconostoc and Lactococcus were the core bacteria at the genu level of all samples. Amyl acetate, 2-butanone and methyl-2-methylpropanoate were positively related to Lactococcus while ethanol was negatively correlated with Lactococcus. And Leuconostoc was positively related to 3-methylbutanal and acetone, while was negatively correlated with hexanal. Results indicated that key volatiles and textural properties of different fresh fermented rice noodle samples were associated with bacterial composition.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sour meat is widely consumed because of its unique flavor. However, the microbial community's structure, the flavor production pathways, and the relationship between microbes and flavors resulting from sour meat fermentation processes remain unclear. In this study, high-throughput sequencing technology and solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used to analyze the structural composition of microbial communities and changes in volatile flavor substances during the fermentation of sour meat. A total of 124 volatile components and 17 free amino acids were detected throughout the fermentation process, of which ethyl decanoate, ethyl butyrate, ethyl lactate, and other ethyl substances were among the 21 volatile compounds that underwent significant changes. There was also a small number of acids, alcohols, and aldehydes. Lactobacillus, Weissella, Staphylococcus, Kodamaea, Hyphopichia, and Yarrowia were the core microorganisms in fermented sour meat. These dominant microorganisms correlated with the changes in most flavor substances. This study provides a theoretical basis for revealing the flavor formation mechanisms in sour meat and the screening of functional strains.

J		Aida, B.; Sihem, T.; Ines, B.; Hatem, L.							Biochemical variability and functional properties of cowpea landraces grown in Hoggar: the Algerian arid region.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Cowpea is among the most grain legumes consumed in Algeria. The Algerian Saharan is a hostile environment characterized by high temperatures, scarcity of water and salinity of water and soil. In these regions, the farmers have for generations cultivated landraces cowpeas which are probably adapted to these particular environments and which may have particular nutritional and functional characteristics. These cowpeas deserve to be known and exploited in breeding and improvement programs. This study aims to determine the nutritional value and functional properties of Saharan cowpea through their chemical composition and the analysis of biochemical variability between accessions taking into consideration the environments of origin. Eighteen cowpea landraces were harvested in an arid region of southern Algeria (Hoggar, Tamanrasset). The seeds composition was evaluated by the determination of certain chemical characteristics such as moisture ash, crude protein, fat, total carbohydrates, and energy value. The antioxidant activity was also evaluated which includes total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (CANET) and lipid peroxidation, which were determined by conventional methods. The results showed variability among the accessions studied (p≥0.05), and that all the landraces had high crude protein and total carbohydrates. The total non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity (CANET) recorded is low, as well as lipid peroxidation. The moisture content, ash content and fat content were also low in these saharan cowpea accessions. The Functional properties of the flour were also evaluated. The water absorption capacity (WAC) varies with an average of 1.17 g/gMS, the oil absorption capacity (OAC) with an average of 0.4 g/gMs, and the swelling index (SI) with an average of 2.63. The accessions NEA7 and NEA13 are the richest in protein and they have the highest nutritional value. We report here for the first time that cowpea seeds grown in the Hoggar region have high biochemical variability and highly acceptable functional characteristics; however, they could be a good source of nutrients. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	4	3509	3522	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00919-5					FSTA:2021-12-Jp17162
J		Aida Saatchi; Hossein Kiani; Mohsen Labbafi							Structural characteristics and functional properties of sesame protein concentrate-maltodextrin conjugates.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Application of sesame protein concentrate (SPC) is limited because of its weak functional properties. Investigations revealed that the grafting reaction occurred between maltodextrin and SPC, as supported by the results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis. Circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence emission spectra confirmed that the treatment altered the molecular structure of SPC. XRD analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed changes in the structural properties of the powders after the graft treatment. Conjugation treatment improved the emulsifying properties which analyzed by different techniques including particle size measurement, zeta-potential, and rheological analysis of emulsions. In addition, the emulsions prepared by the conjugated protein exhibited higher values of viscosity and consistency coefficient. This research showed that conjugation with maltodextrin improved the functional and emulsifying properties of SPC and this product can be introduced as a novel ingredient to develop different food emulsions. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	457	465	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00655-2					FSTA:2021-06-Na1265

Assessment of the physicochemical and conformational changes of ultrasound-driven proteins extracted from soybean okara byproduct.		Foods					This study was aimed at the valorization of the okara byproduct deriving form soy food manufacturing, by using ultrasound at different temperatures for extracting the residual proteins. The physicochemical and conformational changes of the extracted proteins were investigated in order to optimize the procedure. Increasing the temperature from 20 up to 80 °C greatly enhanced the yields and the protein solubility without affecting the viscosity. The protein secondary and tertiary structures were also gradually modified in a significant way. After the ultrasonication at the highest temperature, a significant morphological transition from well-defined single round structures to highly aggregated ones was observed, which was confirmed by measuring the water contact angles and wettability. After the ultrasound process, the improvement of peptides generation and the different amino acid exposition within the protein led to an increase of the antioxidant properties. The integrated strategy applied in this study allows to foster the okara protein obtained after ultrasound extraction as valuable materials for new applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Composition of the protein ingredients from insoluble oat byproducts treated with food-grade enzymes, such as amylase, cellulose/xylanase, and protease.		Foods					The manufacture of plant-based drinks has the drawback of a huge production of underexploited press cakes. In particular, the oat press cake is mainly used in feed formulation, whereas added-value applications in human nutrition are scarce. Considering that enzymatic treatments may be useful to improve the nutritional quality of these insoluble byproducts, this study aimed to evaluate whether the treatment with some food-grade enzymes, such as amylase, cellulase/xylanase, protease, and their combination, may be useful to achieve this goal. Proteomic and peptidomic studies showed that the enzymatic treatments improved the protein extraction yields and induced a release of low molecular weight (LMW) peptides that were demonstrated to provide a useful antioxidant activity. In the treated oat press cake proteins, the concentration of the bound phenolic compounds was decreased, with the exception of caffeic acid, which was increased, and avenanthramides, which remained unchanged. Finally, the enzymatic treatment decreased the concentration of phytic acid. All these results indicate that the enzymatic treatments may be useful to ameliorate the nutritional profile of these protein ingredients, before their inclusion in different food products. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Science					Active films from chitosan incorporated with Arthrospira platensis polysaccharide (APP) of various ratios (0.0%, 0.5%, and 1.0%, w/v) were developed by solution casting. The effect of APP on the structural, physicochemical, mechanical, antimicrobial, and antioxidant properties of the chitosan-APP films (CA-film) was investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) confirmed successful incorporation of chitosan and APP. The compact structure of the films was observed clearly in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns suggest the semi-crystalline structure was increased upon addition of APP. The composite films showed an improved water resistance and vapor barrier properties, and reduced by at least 27.4% and 32.1% in swelling degree (Sd) and water vapor permeability (WVP) compared with chitosan film (C-film), respectively. However, the transparency decreased slightly, which may be due to the shrinkage of the spacing of the polymer interchain. The composite films also displayed enhanced the mechanical properties. The antimicrobial activity of the CA-film showed an increase of at least of 0.41-fold in inhibition zone diameter for E. coli. At a concentration of 1.2 mg/mL, the antioxidant activity of CA-film was enhanced by more than threefold compared with C-film. Therefore, CA-films have good potential as sources of active packaging material for the food industry. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	3	987	995	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15639					FSTA:2021-07-Fe1709

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder that can cause infertility; however, the underlying mechanisms remain ill-defined, and there are no available drugs or strategies for the treatment of PCOS. This study examined the therapeutic effect of resveratrol in a rat model of PCOS. Methods and Results. PCOS is induced in rats by administration of letrozole and a high fat diet to determine whether resveratrol has a protective effect. Oral administration of resveratrol significantly decreased body weight, as well as the serum levels of testosterone and follicle stimulating hormone. Resveratrol improved the estrous cycle by restoring the thickness and number of granular cells. Resveratrol increased the levels of lactate and ATP, decreased pyruvate levels, and restored the glycolytic process, upregulating LDHA, HK2, and PKM2. Resveratrol also upregulated SIRT2, thereby modulating the expression of rate-limiting enzymes of glycolysis. Conclusion. Resveratrol suppressed damage to the ovaries in PCOS rats by restoring glycolytic activity, providing potential targets for the treatment of PCOS. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	24			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100457					FSTA:2022-04-Aj5941

Food Chemistry					The fate of eighteen pesticides in field-collected rice samples during Chinese Baijiu production was systematically studied. The results indicated that steeping decreased flonicamid residue by 73.2% due to its high water-solubility and low octanol/water partition coefficient. The steaming step reduced pesticide residues by 32.0%-75.3% through evaporation or thermal degradation. After steaming, the pesticide residues were further reduced by 39.8-74.2% in fermentation which might be caused by biological degradation. In addition, distillation was shown to be most effective, responsible for greater than 90% losses of the remaining pesticide residues. The processing factors (PFs) were generally lower than 1 for different processes and the whole procedure. These results revealed that the procedure of Chinese Baijiu production could dramatically decrease residues of all the eighteen pesticides. Overall, this study provide important references for monitoring pesticide residue levels during the production of Chinese Baijiu from rice, and ensuring proper risk assessment from pesticide contamination.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Propiconazole is widely used to control fungal diseases in field crops, including celery and onion. The potential risk to the environment and human health has aroused much public concern. Therefore, it is significant to investigate the degradation behaviour, residue distribution, and dietary risk assessment of propiconazole in celery and onion. Results. A sensitive analytical method for determination of propiconazole residue in celery and onion was established and validated through high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The average recovery rate of propiconazole ranged from 85.7% to 101.8%, with a relative standard deviation of 2.1-6.3%. For the dissipation kinetics, the data showed that propiconazole in celery and onion was degraded, with half-lives of 6.1-6.2 days and 8.7-8.8 days respectively. In the terminal residue experiments, the residues of propiconazole were below 4.66 mgkg-1 in celery after application two or three times and were below 0.029 mgkg-1 in onion after application of three or four times with an interval of 14days under the designed dosages. The chronic and acute dietary exposure assessments for propiconazole were valued by risk quotient, with all values being lower than 100%. Conclusion. Propiconazole in celery and onion was rapidly degraded following first-order kinetics models. The dietary risk of propiconazole through celery or onion was negligible to consumers. The study not only offers a valuable reference for reasonable usage of propiconazole on celery and onion, but also facilitates the establishment of maximum residue limits in China. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	5	1998	2005	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10817					FSTA:2021-07-Jq8419

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Tolfenpyrad and dinotefuran are two representative pesticides used for pest control in tea gardens. Their application may bring about a potential risk to the health of consumers. Therefore, it is essential to investigate the residue behavior, transfer and risk assessment of tolfenpyrad, dinotefuran and metabolites from tea garden to teacup. Results. An effective analytical method was established and validated to simultaneously determine tolfenpyrad, dinotefuran and its metabolites (DN and UF) in tea. The average recoveries of tolfenpyrad, dinotefuran, DN and UF were in the range 72.1-106.3%, with relative standard deviations lower than 11.8%. On the basis of the proposed method, the dissipation of tolfenpyrad and dinotefuran in fresh tea leaves followed first-order kinetics models with half-lives of 4.30-7.33days and 4.65-5.50days, respectively. With application amounts of 112.5-168.75g a.i.ha-1 once or twice, the terminal residues of tolfenpyrad and total dinotefuran in green tea were lower than 19.6 and 7.13mgkg-1, respectively, and below their corresponding maximum residue limits. The leaching rates of tolfenpyrad and total dinotefuran during the tea brewing were in the ranges 1.4-2.3% and 93.7-98.1%, respectively. Conclusion. Tolfenpyrad and dinotefuran in tea were easily degraded. The RQc and RQa values for tolfenpyrad were 37.6% and 5.4%, which were much higher than for dinotefuran at 24.7% and 0.84%, respectively.

Journal of Food Science					Baijiu quality control has always been a major challenge for researchers. In this paper, taking furfural which is closely related to baijiu brewing process and organic acids related to baijiu fermentation process and microorganism types as the main discriminating factors, a carbon dot (CDs) sensor array targeting furfural and organic acids was constructed to identify 41 kinds of baijiu. Through the fluorescence response investigation of CDs synthesized by isomers of benzenediol, aminophenol, and phenylenediamine to different baijiu, two CDs synthesized by meta-benzene substitutions containing-NH2 were selected to build a fluorescence sensor array. Due to the aggregation-induced enhancement effect between furfural and the CDs, and the protonation of organic acid and the CDs, different fluorescence changes were observed, the sensor array combined with partial least squares regression could quantitatively analyze furfural and organic acids. What is more, semi-quantitative analysis of furfural and lactic acid in baijiu was performed. Owing to the interaction of the two CDs with furfural and organic acids in baijiu, the sensor array could accurately identify different baijiu through linear discriminant analysis. This sensor array has potential applications in the quantitative analysis of flavor substances in other alcoholic beverages, moreover, this method could provide a quick response and practical tool for real-time quality control monitoring in the baijiu industry. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	7	2924	2938	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15766					FSTA:2021-11-Hl10495

Journal of Food Science					Aichi virus (AiV) that results in gastroenteritis worldwide, is spread through contaminated shellfish and water. The resistance/tolerance of AiV to common inactivation processes along with the absence of commercially available vaccines makes it necessary to study its thermal inactivation kinetics. This research evaluated the heat inactivation of AiV in cell-culture media using 2-ml sterile glass vials by the linear and Weibull models. Heat treatments of AiV titers of 7 log plaque forming units (PFU)/ml were conducted thrice in a water-bath at 50, 54, and 58 °C for up to 90 min. Plaque assays for each dilution in duplicate were used to determine infectious virus titers. Linear model D-values for AiV at 501 °C (=standard error) (come-up time=68 s), 540.7 °C (130 s), and 580.6 °C (251 s) were 43.34.23 (R2=0.40, RMSE=0.56), 5.690.28 (R2=0.80, RMSE=0.43), and 1.200.63 min (R2=0.69, RMSE=0.39), respectively, and the linear model z-value was 5.140.39 °C (R2=0.99, RMSE=0.08). For the same temperatures, the Weibull model td=1 values were 20.988.8 (R2=0.62, RMSE=0.46, alpha (scale parameter)=2.30, beta (shape parameter)=0.38), 3.840.69 (R2=0.85, RMSE=0.38, alpha=1.08, beta=0.66), and 0.870.10 min (R2=0.80, RMSE=0.32, alpha=0.22, beta=0.61), respectively and the z-value (using Td=1) was 5.790.22 °C (R2=1.0, RMSE=0.03). A better fit was obtained with the Weibull model for log reductions versus time with higher R2 and lower RMSE values. Application of AiV inactivation parameters can help reduce the risk of AiV outbreaks. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	9	4110	4118	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15747					FSTA:2022-01-Re0048

X.; Rui Min Vivian Goh; Shao Quan Liu; Cornuz, M.; Kim-Huey Ee; Jingcan Sun; Lassabliere, B.; Bin Yu							A systematic study of key odourants, non-volatile compounds, and antioxidant capacity of cascara (dried Coffea arabica pulp).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Derived from the residues of coffee processing (pulp), cascara has been consumed traditionally as a tea-like infusion, in part due to its pleasant flavour and nutritional properties. In this study, the volatile and non-volatile compositions of five cascaras (Coffea arabica) were systematically characterised to understand their organoleptic and antioxidant properties. Using solvent assisted flavour evaporation, 151 volatile compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, 18 key odourants were elucidated by aroma extract dilution analysis, of which some were common odourants of dried fruits and black tea. Non-volatile compounds, including 7 sugars, 6 organic acids, 3 methylxanthines, and 35 polyphenols were detected and quantified via liquid chromatography techniques. Finally, the volatile and non-volatile compositions of the five cascaras were differentiated through principal component analysis. Therefore, this study expands the current knowledge about cascara and may facilitate further research on its application.

J		Aili Li; Ying Li; Xin Zhang; Congwei Zhang; Tongtong Li; Jingjing Zhang; Chun Li							The human milk oligosaccharide 2′-fucosyllactose attenuates beta-lactoglobulin-induced food allergy through the miR-146a-mediated toll-like receptor 4/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathway.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our previous experiments have confirmed that human milk oligosaccharides (HMO) and its main component 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL), as prebiotics, could effectively alleviate cow milk allergy by regulating the intestinal microecology. This study intended to further explore the molecular mechanism of HMO regulating intestinal immunity. The results of the allergic mouse model showed that oral administration of 2′-FL or HMO reduced beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG)-induced serum-specific IgE secretion and mast cell degranulation, while reducing the inflammatory cytokines, TNF-alpha, IL-4, and IL-6 production and promoting the miR-146a expression. In vitro results further confirmed that 2′-FL or HMO treatment reduced allergen-induced secretion of iNOS, NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species in RAW264.7 cells. At the same time, in contrast to the beta-LG group, 2′-FL dose-dependently inhibited the TLR4/NF-kappaB inflammatory pathway and upregulated miR-146a expression, and the effect of the 2′-FL mid-dose group was similar to that of the HMO intervention group. In particular, adding miR-146a inhibitors to macrophages attenuated the inhibitory effect of 2′-FL on the expression of TRAF6 and IRAKI in the TLR4 pathway, suggesting that miR-146a might be involved in the immune regulation of 2′-FL. The above results indicated that 2′-FL had a similar effect to HMOs, and its effect of reducing beta-LG allergy might be related to the regulation of miR-146a to inhibit TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Our previous study has confirmed that Lactobacillus acidophilus KLDS 1.0738 (La KLDS 1.0738) could alleviate beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg)-induced allergic inflammation. This study further explored its molecular regulation mechanism through an in vitro macrophage model. beta-Lg-induced macrophages were treated with strains of viable or non-viable L. acidophilus and Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) inhibitor or miR-146a inhibitor. Our results revealed that beta-Lg stimulation led to the increased expression of TLR4/NF-kappaB signal pathway in macrophages. Similar to TLR4 inhibitor treatment, La KLDS 1.0738 interventions significantly reduced the allergic inflammation by inhibition of TLR4 pathway, which was superior to the commercial L. acidophilus GMNL-185 strains (La GMNL-185) or the control, especially in living L. acidophilus-treated group. Furthermore, La KLDS 1.0738 strains could remarkably reduce transduction of TLR4 and inflammatory cytokine production, which was closely associated with up-regulation of miR-146a levels. MiR-146a inhibitor attenuated the alleviative effect of La KLDS 1.0738, indicating miR-146a might be a crucial mediator of L. acidophilus strains to reduce beta-Lg-induced inflammation in macrophages through TLR4 pathway. In conclusion, these observations highlighted that probiotics might regulate host miRNA levels to down-regulate TLR4/NF-kappaB-dependent inflammation. Practical applications. Cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common diseases of food allergy, which has a high prevalence in infants and young children. La KLDS 1.0738 has been shown to be effective in alleviating beta-Lg-induced allergic inflammation. Our study further found that treatment with La KLDS 1.0738 could suppress the TLR4/NF-kappaB signaling pathway via modulating miR-146a expression, thereby reducing the overexpression of downstream inflammatory factors. This study not only elucidates the specific pathway of La KLDS 1.0738 to relieve allergic inflammation, but also provides a new insight into the molecular mechanism for the remission and treatment of CMA by probiotics. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13662					FSTA:2022-01-Pa0394

Journal of Food Biochemistry					The current study employed high-fat diet (HFD) induced murine model to assess the relationship between the lipid-lowering effect of aged citrus peel (chenpi) extract and the alterations of gut microbiota. The results showed that intake of chenpi extract for 12 week dose-dependently suppressed HFD-induced body weight, food intake, Lee's index, together with decreased the level of fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Moreover, chenpi extract administration up-regulated the abundance and diversity of fecal microbiota and down-regulated the ratio of Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes, which was characterized by the lower family of Lachnospiraceae, Helicobacteraceae, and Desulfovibrionaceae, and higher family of Bacteroidales_S24-7, Bacteroidaceae, Rikenellaceae, and Ruminococcaceae. Consistently, at the genus levels, chenpi extract treatment reversed the expansions of Helicobacter, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006, and Desulfovibrio, while increased the abundance of Bacteroides, Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group, and Alistipes (belonging to Rikenellaceae family), Anaerotruncus and Odoribacter (belonging to Ruminococcaceae family), which were significantly negatively correlated with the levels of the serum lipid parameters. In conclusion, our findings indicated that anti-obesity ability of chenpi extract might be related to the improvement of gut microbiota imbalance. Practical applications. With the improvement of living standards, the incidence of metabolic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes has increased significantly, and it has become a public health problem that seriously affects the health of the people. Chenpi contains a large amount of active ingredients, flavonoids, and other compounds, which can promote the absorption of the digestive system and have good effects on diseases such as the cardiovascular system. Our previous study has confirmed that the chenpi extract effectively regulated the glucose and lipid metabolism disorder induced by high-fat diet. However, it is not clear whether the effect is closely related to the improvement of gut microbiota. Accordingly, our result would provide a theoretical basis for future research on the relationship between obesity, chenpi extract, and gut microbiota, and support additional understanding of its potential anti-obesity effects. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13541					FSTA:2021-08-Jc10674

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					To investigate the production mechanism of semicarbazide from protein in Chinese softshell turtles at different drying temperatures, the tandem mass tags-tagged protein quantification technique and tandem mass spectrometry were used to screen the differentially abundant proteins of Chinese softshell turtles. Results. Showed that the protein content in the shells showed a decreasing trend with the increase of drying temperature, and the difference between the protein contents at 70 °C and 100 °C was significant (p < 0.05). It was found that 13 differentially abundant proteins were significantly correlated with the change in the amount of semicarbazide. As the drying temperature increased, semicarbazide was generated when the target differential abundance proteins were decomposed with the increase of thermal energy. These results provide a basis for more accurate detection of semicarbazide content in crustacean-based aquatic products from the perspective of proteomics.

Food Science & Nutrition					This work focused on the separation of the active ingredients of maca (Lepidium meyenii Walpers) and evaluated the antioxidative capability of these components with effects on improving glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells. DPPH free radical scavenging and reducing power assays were used to evaluate the antioxidant activity of maca extracts. An insulin-resistant HepG2 cell model induced by glucose, fructose, oleic acid, and palmitic acid was adopted to investigate the effects of maca extracts on regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in this study. LC-MS/MS was then used for determination of the maca n-butanol (NBT) subfraction. The results showed that maca ethanol extract and subfractions of this extract exhibited certain antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, the NBT subfraction reversed the disorders in glucose and lipid metabolism in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and significantly increased the mRNA expression of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and AKT in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the LC-MS/MS results showed that the NBT subfraction contained many active ingredients. Overall, this study suggests that the NBT subfraction of the ethanol extract rich in glucosinolates modulates insulin resistance via PI3K/AKT activation in insulin-resistant HepG2 cells and might exert potentially beneficial effects in improving or treating glucose and lipid metabolic disorders. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Functional Foods					Evaluations have been made about the physicochemical stability in water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) emulsion loaded with resveratrol under different pH, NaCl concentration, temperature, and storage time. The in vitro digestion and Caco-2 cell transport were also investigated. Results showed W/O/W emulsion remained stable at pH 2-8, temperatures of 25-70 °C and could be stable storage for 77 days. With an increase in NaCl concentration from 1 to 500 mM, the zeta potential changed from -40 mV to -10 mV, but the droplets size didn't show any significant change. The in vitro digestion showed W/O/W emulsion could maintain the structure until small intestine which could give higher protecting for resveratrol. Meanwhile, W/O/W emulsion could reduce the efflux rate of resveratrol across the Caco-2 cell monolayers and special complex of W/O/W emulsion could delay resveratrol release. Results. Indicated that W/O/W emulsion was suitable vehicle for resveratrol and could improve its bioavailability considering those complicated influence factors.

Food Chemistry					A colorimetric and fluorescence turn-on dual-signal assay was developed for the determination of ascorbic acid (AA). Because the ultraviolet absorption of the oxidized 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (oxTMB) overlapped with the fluorescence emission of glutathione stabilized Au nanoclusters (AuNCs), the fluorescence of AuNCs can be quenched by oxTMB. When AA was added, the blue oxTMB was reduced to colorless TMB, and the fluorescence of AuNCs was restored simultaneously. The decrease in absorbance and increase in fluorescence signal depended on the concentration of AA. In the determination range of 0.5 to 200 muM, the detection limits (LOD) for AA were as low as 0.15 M and 0.22 M for fluorometric and colorimetric, respectively. The established probe was used successfully for AA detection in living cells and beverages.

Release kinetics of fungicidal antimicrobials into packaged foods.		Journal of Food Safety					This article presents the release kinetics (RK) of a fungicidal antimicrobial agent (AMA), potassium sorbate (PS), that prolongs the shelf life of packaged food. The effects of PS release are explored on peanut and fresh bread to determine the effects of PS on Aspergillus niger (AN) microbe growth. The AN was cultured in a potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium to obtain AMA activity on the film. AMA activity of PS incorporated into cellulose acetate (CA) based film was tested on peanuts and fresh bread for an extended period of time. The RK of PS from the films was obtained by studying the de-swelling properties of PS loaded film at room temperature (24°C) and at elevated temperature (37°C). The diffusion coefficients of PS released through the film network were obtained to be between 8.32 * 10-10 to 7.3 * 10-7 m2/s. The release exponents (n) of PS from the film occurred by anomalous transport with n-values ranging from 0.13 to 0.16 at 24°C and 0.5 to 0.89 at 37°C. The average flux released from the CA film was consistent with the percentage PS release from the CA film showing that modeling the effective diffusion of PS from a porous media is feasible. The released PS was potent enough to inhibit the growth of AN for a week then over a period of 2years. Thereafter, the implications of the results in designing smart food packaging for enhanced food preservation were discussed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Ainaz Alizadeh							Mango nectar as a substrate for L. Plantarum: effect of stevia and inulin on probiotic viability and physico-chemical properties of the synbiotic product.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Probiotic functional foods are an emerging trend in consumer demand. This study aimed to investigate probiotic viability as well as physico-chemical and sensory characteristics of synbiotic sucrose-free mango nectar during 45-days storage time. Mango nectar samples were prepared by incorporating L. plantarum as a probiotic, inulin (0,4, and 8%) as a prebiotic texturizer, and stevia (0,2, and 4%) as a natural low-calorie sweetener. The results showed that the addition of inulin and stevia up to 4% improved the viability of L. plantarum bacteria during 45-day storage. The pH and TSS values of nectar samples were significantly (P<0.05) decreased during storage time, while the viscosity values of the samples were increased. The addition of stevia and inulin improved the L* and b* color values of nectar samples, while a* value of the samples decreased. Finally, the mango nectar sample containing 4% stevia and 4% inulin was selected as optimum formulation because of the higher viability of probiotic bacteria, and acceptable physico-chemical and organoleptic properties. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4226	4232	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00998-4					FSTA:2022-01-Hq0525

Enriched fresh pasta with a sea bass by-product, a novel food: fatty acid stability and sensory properties throughout shelf life.		Foods					A by-product from the filleting of sea bass (Dicentrachus labrax) was used to manufacture enriched pasta. The research aimed at achieving an increase of protein and unsaturated fatty acid contents, making innovative and healthy pasta products that are able to step up fish consumption. Two different kind of cereals were used to make fresh pasta, which were subjected to frozen storage with the addition or not of a rosemary antioxidant. The developed pastas were analyzed by physicochemical methods. Proximal analysis demonstrated an improvement of nutritional values on those of a common pasta. Fatty acid profiles, acidity indices, and TBARS (Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) index confirmed the stability of fat and effective protection against oxidation, especially in pasta with added antioxidant. The cooking time for pasta was set at 90 s, and color parameters were modified due to the incorporation of fish in the pasta-making process. An enrichment in fatty acids omega-3 and omega-6 was also confirmed. The conversion of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in frozen storage was detected, which remained stable during 90 days. Finally, sensory profiles of enriched pasta were found to be adequate and improved following the addition of an antioxidant due to a decrease of negative attributes associated with oxidation. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					The fish industry generates by-products that are still nutrient-rich. Its incorporation in pasta production could be an interesting option to get functional food. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the nutritional composition, technological properties and sensory quality of two pastas containing tuna and sea bass by-products, separately. Durum wheat semolina and fish by-product concentrates were used in pasta manufacturing. Fatty acids profile, optimal cooking time, texture profile analysis, color, weight gain, swelling index, cooking losses and moisture were determined and compared with a non-containing fish reference. A sensory analysis was also carried out. In general, results showed a higher content of fatty acids in tuna pasta than in sea bass pasta. The texture profile analysis (TPA) showed lower hardness and fracturability in the fish pasta. Cohesiveness was higher in the tuna pasta while sea bass pasta was brighter. Fish incorporation caused a decrease in weight gain and swelling index and an increase in cooking losses. Sensory analysis established differences in homogeneity, typical aroma, fish flavor, fish odor and elasticity. It was concluded that the use of these by-products results in a more nutritious pasta although tuna content should be reduced (<3%) to improve its sensory profile. © 2021 by the authors.

Gluten-free pasta enriched with fish by-product for special dietary uses: technological quality and sensory properties.		Foods					Gluten-free pasta enriched with fish can support a nutritive and suitable option for people with celiac disease that allows achieving the benefits of fish consumption, especially the consumption of Omega-3 fatty acids; however, this requires that the pasta has adequate technological and sensory properties. For this purpose, four optimal formulations, obtained with an iterative process, were analyzed to determine the effect of the different ingredients (yellow corn flour, white corn flour, and rice flour) in gluten-free pasta compared to commercial wheat pasta. An evaluation of the color, texture, and technological properties were conducted, and the pasta was sensorially characterized. The enriched gluten-free pasta required shorter cooking times (3 min) and was characterized by lower hardness, springiness, gumminess, chewiness, and fracturability, and had higher values of adhesiveness than wheat pasta. In addition, the incorporation of yellow corn gives gluten-free pasta a similarity in color to commercial pasta, with a value of DeltaE between 5.5 and 8.0. Regarding the sensory analysis, gluten-free pasta was characterized by slight fishy aromas and flavors with some aftertaste compared to commercial pasta. Finally, the use of different cereals to obtain gluten-free pasta could be a good and feasible alternative despite the technological and sensory modifications observed. © 2021 by the authors.

Herein, an ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry method for comprehensive lipidomic profiling of oilseeds was established and applied. First, the lipid extraction efficiency and lipid coverage of four different lipid extraction methods were compared. The optimized methyl tert-butyl ether extraction method was superior to isopropanol, Bligh-Dyer, and Folch extraction methods, in terms of the operation simplicity, lipid coverage, and number of identified lipids. Then, global lipidomic analysis of soybean, sesame, peanut, and rapeseed was conducted. A total of 764 lipid molecules, including 260 triacylglycerols, 54 diacylglycerols, 313 glycerophospholipids, 36 saccharolipids, 35 ceramides, 30 free fatty acids, 21 fatty esters, and 15 sphingomyelins were identified and quantified. The compositions and contents of lipids significantly varied among different oilseeds. Our results provided a theoretical basis for the selection and breeding of varieties of oilseed as well as deep processing of oilseed for the edible oil industry.										2021	69	32	8964	8980	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07343					FSTA:2021-12-Na2897

Food Research International					Vinegar is consumed worldwide as a food condiment, especially in the Chinese diet. The present study optimized the addition of A. niger biofortified-bran Qu (0.3%, 0.45%, and 0.6%) as additional starter to improve total acid content and starch utilization rate in industrial-scale Baoning vinegar production. In addition, this novel study determined the quality and microbial community changes of Baoning vinegar during three-round biofortification in industrial scale. Our results indicated that A. niger biofortified-bran Qu added at 0.6% resulted in higher total acid content and starch utilization rate of vinegar Pei. Biofortification imposed minor changes in the microbial community during three-round biofortification, and more variation was observed in fungal community than that in bacterial community. Most importantly, the quality of Baoning vinegar remained relatively stable. This information further confirmed the feasibility of multiple rounds of A. niger biofortification, and can be used to provide theoretical basis for industrial-scale production.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Arsanilic acid (ASA) residue, which is the most common contaminant in edible animal tissues such as pork and liver, has caused environmental and food-safety concerns. In this study, direct and indirect competitive fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assays (dc-FLISA and ic-FLISA) incorporating quantum dots (QDs) as the fluorescent label were developed for the first time to detect ASA residues in edible pork and animal liver. Monoclonal antibodies against ASA and rabbit anti-mouse antibody were conjugated to orange QDs with excitation wavelengths at 450 nm, and the QD-Abs served as detection probes. The limits of detection for dc-FLISA and ic-FLISA were 0.11 ng/mL and 0.001 ng/mL, respectively. QD-FLISA was used to analyse spiked samples; recoveries ranged from 80.2%-91.2% in dc-FLISA and 82.5%-91.2% in ic-FLISA, and the coefficients of variations (CV) were less than 12%. Compared with conventional indirect competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ic-ELISA), the QD-FLISA described here was more sensitive and accurate in the analysis of ASA residues in animal tissues. Moreover, the results of QD-FLISA correlated well with HPLC. These results indicate that dc-FLISA and ic-FLISA are sensitive and reliable for detection of ASA residues in edible animal tissues. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	5	820	829	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1885751					FSTA:2021-08-Sj4831

Food waste and qualitative evaluation of menus in public university canteens - challenges and opportunities.		Foods					Background. This study aims to evaluate food waste and menu quality in two canteens (A and B) from a Portuguese public university in order to identify challenges and opportunities to improve the food service. Methods. Food waste included the analysis of two canteens over 5 consecutive days by selective aggregate weighing. A qualitative evaluation of a 5-week menu cycle related to lunches was performed through the Qualitative Evaluation of Menus (AQE-d) method. Results. Both menus have "satisfactory" evaluations and lower adequacy to the dietary guidelines in criteria A, which evaluates general items from the dish, and in criteria B, which evaluates meat, fish and eggs. The calculated mean of food waste in both canteens exceeded the acceptable limit of 10%, except for the vegetarian (7.5%) dish in canteen A. The biggest waste was found in the vegetarian dish (16.8%) in canteen A. In meat dishes the conduit presents more waste (17.0%) than in fish and vegetarian dishes. Among these, the vegetables were the most wasted (25.3% and 27.9%, respectively). Conclusion. This work presents some insights to future interventions in the direction of a healthier and more sustainable foodservice. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Comparison of low energy and high energy electron beam treatments on sensory and chemical properties of seeds.		Food Research International					Consumption of fresh and minimally processed foods such as seeds as a part of a healthy diet is a trend. Unfortunately, fat-rich seeds are often contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and face frequent product recalls. Electron beams have been applied as a microbial decontamination measure for decades. Conventionally high energy electron beams (HEEB) are being used, whereas low energy electron beams (LEEB, <300 keV) have only recently been introduced to the food industry and more studies are needed. Electron beam treatment has several advantages over other decontamination technologies. The treatment is non-thermal, chemical-free, water-free, and does not use radioactive substances. The effect of electron beams on the sensory and chemical properties of seeds has not been widely studied. This study assessed LEEB and HEEB treated pumpkin and flax seeds immediately after treatments, and after three months of storage. The seeds' sensory profiles were altered after both treatments when compared with non-treated samples, with a higher dose leading to a greater level of alteration. However, the sensory profile of LEEB treated seeds was similar to the non-treated seeds whereas HEEB treated seeds differed from both. The storage period of three months further increased the observed differences between the samples. LEEB and HEEB treatments seemed to cause lipid degradation as the content of volatile aldehydes was increased. This effect was more profound in HEEB treated samples. The data presented in this study shows that LEEB as a microbial reduction solution has great potential to preserve the chemical and sensory properties of nutritious seeds.

J		Aishwarya Jaiswal; Vanshdeep Pathania; Jyothi Lakshmi, A.							An exploratory trial of food formulations with enhanced bioaccessibility of iron and zinc aided by spices.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Iron and zinc deficiencies have emerged as controllable nutritional problems of concern all over the globe with varying intensities in all age groups. Additionally, the micronutrients especially zinc is associated with maintaining a sound immune system and hence enhancing the bioavailability of minerals to be an ideal strategy for alleviation of deficiencies. The investigation was undertaken to study the effect of spices on the digestibility of proteins and bioaccessibility of iron and zinc in complementary food mixes (CFM) and Indian flatbread mixes (IFBM). CFM and IFBMs were formulated and spices were added at 1 and 2% to the matrices and their effect on protein, iron and zinc bioaccessibility was determined. In CFMs, spices enhanced the bioaccessible iron by 3-6 fold and 1.7-2.5 fold in IFBMs and zinc bioaccessibility by 1.2-2.0 fold at 2% level in both the mixes. Thermal treatments showed further enhancement in nutrient digestibility at sensorial acceptable levels. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report demonstrating the beneficial role of spices on mineral bioaccessibility in CFM's and IFB's. Spices in addition to enhancing the mineral bioaccessibility is also known to boost immunity which is the need of the hour.

Food Chemistry					Curcumin, together with demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin as a whole called curcuminoids, is an active phytochemical constituent present in the turmeric. When it comes to their analysis, most will rely on UV-Visible spectroscopy, HPLC and LC-MS methods. Looking to improve productivity, time and simplicity, we are proposing a1H NMR based approach for curcuminoids analysis and its applications to different geographical regions. In the present work, sample preparation protocol is reported for the simultaneous determination of curcuminoids using 1H NMR. For the quantification of curcuminoids, 6-7 ppm vinylic proton region in the 1H NMR spectrum was used, where acetone was observed as the suitable solvent in terms of curcuminoids solubility and proper resolution of peak. The result shows that curcumin (46.8-59.50%) was major among all varieties, followed by DMC (22.15-27.70%) and BDMC (17.52-30.29%) except in Andhrapradesh variety, where BDMC (30.29%) was more than DMC (22.89%).

Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Tef (Eragrostis tef), is a gluten-free orphan cereal, crop of nutritional and economical significance. Here we used untargeted metabolomics to survey metabolite variation in 14 diverse tef accessions at 15-days post germination. Tef genotypes were classified into four metabolomic groups where variation was linked to flavones and flavonols. Further analysis on white seeded accessions shows variation related to sucrose and important vitamins, nicotinamides (vitamin B3) riboflavin (vitamin B2) and folate (vitamin B9). Coloured seeded accessions showed variation in metabolism related to amino acid and sugars. This study highlights the potential of metabolomics in exploring the nutritional traits in tef. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	76	4	536	539	0921-9668				10.1007/s11130-021-00931-6					FSTA:2022-09-Mg5227

Application of spectroscopic techniques to evaluate heat treatments in milk and dairy products: an overview of the last decade.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					In the food industry, thermal treatments are generally an essential step to increase the shelf life of the products. This is especially true for milk and dairy products in which heat treatments help to eliminate pathogenic organisms, minimize microbiological development, and improve some sensory properties. However, they can also induce biochemical, physico-chemical, and sensory changes in foods, and then adversely affect the final quality of the products. To assess the quality of milk and dairy products during heating, some non-destructive techniques exist. In this article, the application of spectroscopic non-destructive techniques (fluorescence, infrared, NMR) is analyzed to point out the pertinence by using them as tools to monitor milk and dairy product quality changes during heating. An overview of the last studies on the effect of different conventional and emerging methods of milk and dairy product heating on biochemical, physico-chemical, and sensory quality is also presented, as well as the perspectives of research in this topic. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aita, G. M.; Young Hwan Moon; Verret, C.; Foster, T.							Energy cane bagasse as a source of prebiotics.		International Sugar Journal					Prebiotics can be grouped into established prebiotics (inulin, fructooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides, lactulose, polydextrose) or emerging prebiotics (isomaltooligosaccharides, xylooligosaccharides (XOS), lactitol). XOOS are non-toxic, stable at acidie pH, heat resistant, and can achieve positive biological effects at low daily doses and low caloric content, properties that are the same or more desirable than the already established prebioties. XOS are present in plants in very low amounts so there is a great opportunity to isolate XOS with varying degrees of polymerization from the hemicellulose (xylan) fraction of lignocellulosie materials (e. g, bagasse), a source that offers both economic and environmental advantages. The thermochemical production of XOS by diluted sulfuric acid hydrolysis of energy cane bagase was evaluated, as well as the recovery of XOS by the combined use of activated carbon adsorption, water washing and ethanol desorption. The recovered XOS was tested for its prebiotic activity on Bifidobacterium adolescentis ATCC 15703 (a well-established probiotic). The final product of extracted XOS from energy cane bagasse (XOS EC Bagasse crude sample) had a purity of 93%, which was comparable to the purities observed with two commerecially available XOS prebiotics (extracted from corncobs), CPA (89%) and CPB (93%). XOS EC Bagasse crude sample exhibited prebiotic properties by stimulating the growth of B. adolescentis ATCC 15703 and by producing lactic acid. The observed prebiotic activities were comparable to the commercial prebioties CPA, CPB (xylose oligomers) and IMO (glucose oligomers).										2021	123	1465	30	39	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-07-Lc1186

J		Aitta, E.; Marsol-Vall, A.; Damerau, A.; Baoru Yang							Enzyme-assisted extraction of fish oil from whole fish and by-products of baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras).		Foods					Baltic herring (Clupea harengus membras) is one of the most abundant commercially caught fish species from the Baltic Sea. Despite the high content of fat and omega-3 fatty acids, the consumption of Baltic herring has decreased dramatically over the last four decades, mostly due to the small sizes and difficulty in processing. At the same time there is an increasing global demand for fish and fish oil rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This study aimed to investigate enzyme-assisted oil extraction as an environmentally friendly process for valorizing the underutilized fish species and by-products to high quality fish oil for human consumption. Three different commercially available proteolytic enzymes (Alcalase, Neutrase and Protamex) and two treatment times (35 and 70 min) were investigated in the extraction of fish oil from whole fish and by-products from filleting of Baltic herring. The oil quality and stability were studied with peroxide-and p-anisidine value analyses, fatty acid analysis with GC-FID, and volatile compounds with HS-SPME-GC-MS. Overall, longer extraction times led to better oil yields but also increased oxidation of the oil. For whole fish, the highest oil yields were from the 70-min extractions with Neutrase and Protamex. Protamex extraction with 35 min resulted in the best fatty acid composition with the highest content of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) but also increased oxidation compared to treatment with other enzymes. For by-products, the highest oil yield was obtained from the 70-min extraction with Protamex without significant differences in EPA and DHA contents among the oils extracted with different enzymes. Oxidation was lowest in the oil produced with 35-min treatment using Neutrase and Protamex. This study showed the potential of using proteolytic enzymes in the extraction of crude oil from Baltic herring and its by-products. However, further research is needed to optimize enzymatic processing of Baltic herring and its by-products to improve yield and quality of crude oil. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Skeletal muscle is a major organ in animals, which constitutes over 40% of livestock body weight, and plays a critical role in metabolism and homeostasis in an organism. Autophagy and apoptosis are two major processes to determine cell fate. Recently, the importance of autophagy and apoptosis in myogenesis has been identified; however, their crosstalk is not well defined. In this study, we aimed to explore the relationship between apoptosis and autophagy during myogenic differentiation. The results showed that the level of autophagy was consistent with apoptosis during myogenic differentiation. The increased apoptosis activated autophagy, and then autophagy inhibited apoptosis in turn to prevent excessive apoptosis and maintain the stability of cells. The interaction between autophagy and apoptosis determines the balance of cell death and cell survival, allowing the skeletal muscle cells to differentiate normally.										2021	69	13	3942	3951	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00140					FSTA:2021-08-Sa4298

Journal of Functional Foods					Intensive investigation of phytochemicals from edible Melicope glabra leaves provided a series of O-alkylated quercetins (1-13). The quercetin 1 bearing prenyl and methyl motif showed potent inhibition to human acetylcholinesterase (hAChE) with mixed type I mode, while quercetin was inactive. The position of methyl group was also a critical factor to hAChE inhibition: 1 (4′-O-methyl, IC50 = 12.7 muM) vs2 (3′-O-methyl, IC50 = 119 muM). Inhibitory potency was doubly confirmed with the binding affinity (KSV) based on fluorescence quenching. O-Methyl groups on quercetin were observed to influence beta-secretase (BACE1) inhibition. Thus, O-methylated quercetins (4-6) displayed potential inhibitions against BACE1 with IC50 values of 1.3, 4.1, and 14.1 muM, respectively. All compounds (3-6) have noncompetitive mode to BACE1. Additionally, all quercetin derivatives (1-13) had antioxidant potentials against different radical sources (ABTS, ORAC and FRAP). The UPLC-ESI-Q-TOF/MS indicated that the leaves part had promising metabolites towards hAChE and BACE1 inhibitions, which are the most predominant phytochemicals.

Journal of Dairy Science					Koumiss is a type of famous fermented mare milk and considered an important nutritious beverage in central Asian countries. However, the production of koumiss cannot meet public demand in the market due to availability of mare milk. In the present study, 52 lactic acid bacteria and 20 yeast strains from traditional homemade Kazakhstan koumiss were isolated and identified. The isolates were used in a trial that included fermented cow milk, and the flavor profiles, color, and taste to determine their contribution in the co-fermentation of cow milk. Based on the sensory evaluation, KZLAB13 and KZY10 strains were selected as the best cofermentation combinations. The optimal fermentation conditions were confirmed as the ratio of the starter culture 2.4:1.6 % (vol/vol) KZLAB13 strain to KZY10 strain and a temperature of 36°C for 16 h using response surface methodology. After evaluating the quality of the optimized cow-milk koumiss compared with the Kazakhstan koumiss, results suggested that cow milk fermented by these 2 strains possessed a promising taste, flavor, and physicochemical and rheological properties. Altogether, our results showed that cow milk fermented with a combination of KZLAB13 and KZY10 strains can simulate the taste, flavor, and quality of traditional koumiss. Our study provided a novel alternative to mare-milk koumiss and could be used in dairy programs to fulfill the needs of people.

Food & Function					Isorhamnetin (ISO), a flavonoid compound isolated from sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) fruit, has anti-inflammatory effects. However, the effects of ISO on neuroinflammation and cognitive function are still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of ISO on cognitive impairment in obese mice induced by a high-fat and high fructose diet (HFFD). It has been found that oral administration of ISO (0.03% w/w and 0.06% w/w) for 14 weeks significantly reduced the body weight, food intake, liver weight, liver lipid level, and serum lipid level of HFFD-fed mice. ISO can also significantly prevent HFFD-induced neuronal working, spatial, and long-term memory impairment. Notably, the ISO treatment activated the CREB/BDNF pathway and increased neurotrophic factors in the brains of mice. Furthermore, ISO inhibited HFFD-induced microglial overactivation and down-regulated inflammatory cytokines in both serum and the brain. It can also inhibit the expression of p-JNK, p-p38, and p-NFkappaB protein in the mouse brain. In conclusion, these results indicated that ISO mitigated HFFD-induced cognitive impairments by inhibiting the MAPK and NFkappaB signaling pathways, suggesting that ISO might be a plausible nutritional intervention for metabolic syndrome-related cognitive complications. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	19	9261	9272	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03165h					FSTA:2022-01-Jq1009

An insight into the growing concerns of styrene monomer and poly(styrene) fragment migration into food and drink simulants from poly(styrene) packaging.		Foods					Poly (styrene) (PS) has been heavily utilised in disposable food packaging due to its insulating properties, optical translucency, and long-shelf life. Despite these desirable characteristics, (PS) poses toxicity concerns to human's health through styrene monomer leaching into foodstuffs. Environmental and marine hazards are another growing concerns due to improper and/or absence of recycling strategies and facilities. This preliminary work aims to investigate the effect of temperature, food composition and contact times on the migration of the styrene monomer from poly (styrene) food contact materials into food simulants. Poly (styrene) cups showed a relatively low level of styrene migration with the highest being 0.110 g/mL, whereas food containers showed a much higher level of styrene leaching with up to 6 g/mL. This could be due to an increase in the hydrophobicity of the simulants' characteristics from low to high fat content and the increase in the testing temperatures from 5 °C to 70 °C. ANOVA statistical analysis is used to compare the means of three or more groups of data, whereas t-test analysis is used to compare means of two groups. This was carried out on each individual sample to determine the significance of changing the temperature, simulant type, or both on the level of migration observed in the results. All significant values were tested at 95% confidence level p < 0.05, concluding that fat content and high temperatures were found to significantly increase the level of styrene migration. Nile Red staining method was used to demonstrate that particulate poly (styrene), as well as styrene monomer, migrated into tested food simulants from typical containers, which is becoming a cause for concern as evidence of microplastic ingestion increases. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect of gluten ingestion and FODMAP restriction on intestinal epithelial integrity in patients with irritable bowel syndrome and self-reported non-coeliac gluten sensitivity.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Since epithelial barrier dysfunction has been associated with gluten and fermentable oligosaccharide, disaccharide, monosaccharide, and polyols (FODMAPs), the effect of alterations in FODMAP a gluten intake on epithelial barrier function in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who self-reported gluten sensitivity. Methods and results. Circulating concentrations of markers of epithelial injury (syndecan-1 and intestinal fatty acid-binding protein) and bacterial translocation (lipopolysaccharide-binding protein and soluble CD14) are measured while consuming habitual gluten-free diet and during blinded challenges with gluten or placebo on a background of low FODMAP intake. In 33 patients, only syndecan-1 concentrations during their habitual diet are elevated (median 43 ng mL-1) compared with 23 ng mL-1 in 49 healthy subjects (p< 0.001). On a low FODMAP diet, symptoms are reduced and levels of syndecan-1 (but not other markers) fell by a median 3335% (p< 0.001) irrespective of whether gluten is present or not. Conclusion. Gluten ingestion has no specific effect on epithelial integrity or symptoms in this cohort, but reducing FODMAP intake concomitantly reduces symptoms and reverses apparent colonic epithelial injury. These findings highlight the heterogeneity of populations self-reporting gluten sensitivity and implicate FODMAPs in colonic injury in IBS. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	5			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.201901275					FSTA:2021-06-Aj9799

A comparative analysis of methods (LC-MS/MS, LC-MS and rapid test kits) for the determination of diarrhetic shellfish toxins in oysters, mussels and pipis.		Toxins					Rapid methods for the detection of biotoxins in shellfish can assist the seafood industry and safeguard public health. Diarrhetic Shellfish Toxins (DSTs) are produced by species of the dinoflagellate genus Dinophysis, yet the comparative efficacy of their detection methods has not been systematically determined. Here, we examined DSTs in spiked and naturally contaminated shellfish-Sydney Rock Oysters (Saccostrea glomerata), Pacific Oysters (Magallana gigas/Crassostrea gigas), Blue Mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) and Pipis (Plebidonax deltoides/Donax deltoides), using LC-MS/MS and LC-MS in 4 laboratories, and 5 rapid test kits (quantitative Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) and Protein Phosphatase Inhibition Assay (PP2A), and qualitative Lateral Flow Assay (LFA)). We found all toxins in all species could be recovered by all laboratories using LC-MS/MS (Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry) and LC-MS (Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry); however, DST recovery at low and mid-level concentrations (<0.1 mg/kg) was variable (0-150%), while recovery at high-level concentrations (>0.86 mg/kg) was higher (60-262%). While no clear differences were observed between shellfish, all kits delivered an unacceptably high level (25-100%) of falsely compliant results for spiked samples. The LFA and the PP2A kits performed satisfactorily for naturally contaminated pipis (0%, 5% falsely compliant, respectively). There were correlations between spiked DSTs and quantitative methods was highest for LC-MS (r2=0.86) and the PP2A kit (r2=0.72). Overall, our results do not support the use of any DST rapid test kit as a stand-alone quality assurance measure at this time. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Cognitive impairment by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was attenuated by dietary supplements of marble vine (Dioclea reflexa) and plantain (Musa paradisiaca) dough meals in Albino rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study investigates the protective effect of formulated marble vine/plantain dough meals on cognitive impairment in diabetic rats. Wistar rats were divided into eight groups (n= 6) and fed with HFD for 14 days and a single dose of streptozotocin intraperitoneally on the 14th day (except control rats). Diabetic rats were treated with formulated diets and metformin. The ameliorative effect of the formulated doughs on cerebral damage in diabetic rats with respect to weight gain/loss, glucose and insulin levels, oxidative damage, neurological dysfunction, and histological alterations were assessed. The formulated diet had high protein and fiber content values ranged from 13.00 to 25.04 g/100 g and from 5.23 to 6.20 g/100 g, respectively compared to the control. Blood glucose level was observed, thereby mitigating the cerebral oxidative damage. The diet significantly ameliorated the neurological dysfunction as adjudged by increased dopamine concentration and lowered acetylcholinesterase activity; results were also supported by the outcomes from brain histopathological study. Practical applications: Underutilized leguminous seeds such as marble vine seeds are known for their nutraceutical potentials due to their numerous biochemical components. The study provides preliminary information on the potential of marble vine/plantain functional dough meals in the management of neurological complications resulting from type 2 diabetes mellitus in albino rats. Generally, the formulated doughs possess neuroprotective potentials in preventing neurological complications arising from diabetes. However, the effect of marble vine-plantain dough meal in managing the brain damage should be further investigated through the clinical trials before development for pharmaceutical applications. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Phytometabolomic analysis of boiled rhizome of Nymphaea nouchali (Burm. f.) using UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE, LC-QqQ-MS & GC-MS and evaluation of antihyperglycemic and antioxidant activities.		Food Chemistry					Phytometabolomic analysis of Nymphaea nouchali (Burm. F.) boiled rhizome was carried out utilizing UPLC-Q-TOF-MSE, LC-QqQ-MS and GC-MS techniques and evaluated for antihyperglycemic and antioxidative stress potentials. Metabolomic analysis revealed presence of multiple antidiabetic and antioxidant compounds. Boiled rhizome powder exhibited potent antihyperglycemic activity against sugar-induced postprandial hyperglycemia in rats plausibly due to the presence of intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitory and augmenting cellular glucose uptake activities. It also prevented hyperglycemia-induced hemoglobin and insulin glycation. Rhizome displayed potent reducing power, effectively scavenged various reactive oxygen species. It displayed antioxidative stress potential in assuaging H2O2 induced erythrocyte hemolysis and antioxidant activity by inhibiting membrane lipid peroxidation. Boiled rhizome was also found to preserve the loss of cellular antioxidants under H2O2 induced oxidative stress and disturbances caused to mitochondrial membrane potential. This is the first research reporting boiled N. nouchali rhizome as an ideal food material to manage the cause of hyperglycemia and resultant oxidative stress.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Citrus fruit are highly susceptible to infection by several fungal pathogens during postharvest storage. Therefore, harvested citrus fruit receive a series of treatments in the packhouse such as initial drenching, washing and disinfection, immersion in heated solutions of chemical fungicides and waxing that also include fungicides to reduce the inoculum load, eradicate existing infections and protect the fruit from subsequent infections. However, little is currently known about the impact of these packhouse management practices on the naturally-occurring microbiota of citrus fruit. The present study provides a comprehensive information on the effects of packhouse treatments on the peel microbiome of mandarin fruit (cv. Orr). Results revealed significant shifts in the diversity of both bacterial and fungal community, particularly after hot chemical-drench treatment. Notably, the packhouse treatments did not show significant effect on the relative abundance of Penicillium in the peel tissue, which are, the most common postharvest pathogen of citrus fruits.. Results of our study at this particular packhouse suggest that the initial drenching treatment had a lesser impact on the peel micrbiome, while hot chemical drenching and waxing treatments significantly altered the fruit peel microbial diversity.

Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of chitosan-epigallocatechin gallate conjugate (CS-EGCG) at various ratios (10:0, 9:1, 8:2, 7:3, 6:4 and 5:5, w/w) and glycerol (30 and 50%, w/w) on mechanical, barrier and optical properties of CS films and CS/CS-EGCG composite films was studied. CS films added with 30 or 50% glycerol (CS-30G or CS-50G, respectively) had high tensile strength and elongation at break. Generally, CS/CS-EGCG composite films had higher resistance to light transmission than CS films (p < 0.05). With augmenting concentrations of CS-EGCG, films with lower lightness (L*) and higher redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) were obtained. Therefore, among composite films, those with CS/CS-EGCG ratio of 8:2, containing 30 or 50% glycerol, were selected for further analyses in comparison to CS films. Composite films, regardless of glycerol levels, showed higher antioxidant and antimicrobial activities as compared to CS films (p < 0.05). Overall, CS/CS-EGCG (8:2) composite films had satisfactory physical properties with increased antimicrobial and antioxidant activities and could serve as promising packaging for food shelf-life extension.

J		Ajay Mittal; Avtar Singh; Soottawat Benjakul							Use of nanoliposome loaded with chitosan-epigallocatechin gallate conjugate for shelf-life extension of refrigerated Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer) slices.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Treatments of chitosan-epigallocatechin gallate (CE) conjugate nanoliposome (CELP) and unencapsulated CE conjugate (UNCE) at different concentrations (0.025 and 0.05 g 100 g-1) on quality and shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices (ASB-S) kept at 4 °C were studied. Total viable count of ASB-S treated with 0.05 g 100 g-1 CELP (SB-CELP-0.05) was less than permissible limit (6 log CFUg-1 sample) within 15 days. Moreover, SB-CELP-0.05 sample had the lowest pathogenic and spoilage bacterial count than remaining samples during the storage (P< 0.05). Lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and peroxide values were obtained for SB-CELP-0.05 sample than those treated with 0.05 g 100 g-1 UNCE (SB-UNCE-0.05) at the end of storage (P< 0.05). The result was also advocated by higher polyunsaturated fatty acid content of SB-CELP-0.05 than SB-UNCE-0.05 (P< 0.05). Therefore, CELP efficiently extended ASB-S shelf-life with high consumer acceptability at 4 °C for minimum 12 days, whereas control had the shelf-life less than 6 days. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	8	3795	3806	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14995					FSTA:2021-11-Rc3982

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Quality and shelf-life of Asian sea bass slices (ASBS) wrapped with chitosan (CS) /CS-epigallocatechin gallate (CE) conjugate composite or CS films and packaged in air or under vacuum during storage at 4 °C were studied. Total viable count was less than permissible limit (6log. CFUg-1 sample) for ASBS wrapped with CS/CE conjugate composite film under vacuum (ASBS-COMP-VP) after 18days. Moreover, lower microbial proliferation and volatile base contents were attained in ASBS-COMP-VP sample than other samples during the storage (P<0.05). At the end of storage, ASBS-COMP-VP sample had lower lipid oxidation than those wrapped with CS film (P<0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acid content of ASBS-COMP-VP was retained at higher content at day 18. Therefore, ASBS-COMP-VP had the enhanced shelf-life with high acceptability up to 18days at 4 °C, while ASBS wrapped with CS film and packaged in air or under vacuum had the shelf-life of 9 and 12days, respectively. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	11	6025	6038	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15203					FSTA:2022-03-Rc0693
J		Ajay Mittal; Avtar Singh; Aluko, R. E.; Soottawat Benjakul							Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shell chitosan and the conjugate with epigallocatechin gallate: antioxidative and antimicrobial activities.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Chitin was isolated from Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) shell by demineralization and deproteinization using 1 M HCl (1:20, w/v) for 2 hr and 1 M NaOH (1:30 w/v) for 80 min at 70°C, respectively, with 29.96% optimum yield. Thereafter, the chitin was deacetylated at various temperatures for different times, in which the chitosan prepared at 130°C for 4 hr (CS-130-4) showed higher yield (73.11%), crystallinity index (19.75%), and 85.28% degree of deacetylation (DDA) as measured by1H-NMR. CS-130-4 was then conjugated to epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) at various concentrations (2-8%, w/w of chitosan). CS-130-4 was grafted with 8% EGCG (CE-8) had the higher conjugation efficiency (92.63%) and antimicrobial/antioxidant activities as compared to other conjugates (p<.05).1H-NMR analysis also confirmed the successful conjugation of CE-8. All the conjugates were completely water soluble. Therefore, CE-8 may be used as the natural antimicrobial and antioxidant agents in various food products. Practical applications. Shrimp shells are generally considered as processing by-products of the shellfish industries and can cause environmental pollution when improperly disposed. Chitosan from shrimp shells has been widely produced but it is soluble mainly in acidic solutions, which limits its applications. However, grafting of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) onto chitosan yielded water-soluble conjugates with enhanced antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. Although several preservatives have been applied in foods, their health hazards have been a major concern. To mitigate this limitation, chitosan-EGCG conjugates could be employed as alternative natural preservatives or additives for shelf-life extension of various foods. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13569					FSTA:2021-05-Re1895

How the inclusion of cod (Pseudophycis bachus) protein enriched powder to bread affects the in vitro protein and starch digestibility, amino acid profiling and antioxidant properties of breads.		European Food Research and Technology					The aim of the present study was to incorporate Pseudophycis bachus powder (cod fish powder-CFP) into bread with different levels (5%, 10% and 15%), and evaluate the physical (moisture, volume), technological (texture and colour), nutritional (amino acid content, protein and starch digestibility), and nutraceutical (total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant capacity) properties of the fortified breads compared with a control bread. Partial substitution of wheat flour with CFP improved the nutritional and nutraceutical properties of bread. The results showed that fortification of wheat flour with CFP reduced the predictive glycaemic index of bread. Additionally, bread with CFP showed an increased (p< 0.05) protein digestibility and protein quality in terms of an increased corrected amino acid score (CAAS). Moreover, total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of bread samples were increased with CFP addition. Thus, enrichment of bread with CFP may be a significant alternative to the food industry to deliver nutritionally enriched bread. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	5	1177	1187	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03699-w					FSTA:2021-08-Mn4559

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, three component mixtures (TCM) were prepared by rapid visco analyser with wheat starch (WS), 15% of cod oil (CO), salmon oil (SO), coconut oil (CONT) and 10% wheat gluten (WG). The effect of the different inclusions on the physicochemical, structural and in vitro enzymatic properties of starch were evaluated, and the mechanisms involved between WS, CO, SO, CONT and WG observed. Results. Illustrated that significant decrease in peak viscosity and enthalpy values, and increased pasting temperatures of TCM samples, compared to WS and WG, due to the amylose-lipid complex formation. SEM images showed an embedded structure of starch granules while colour and textural indices of WS were significantly decreased in TCM samples. The findings of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 13C nuclear magnetic response (NMR) techniques showed that the structural changes occurred in TCM samples with more ordered structure of complex formation with starch-lipid and protein. Results exhibited a significant decreased in starch digestibility of TCM samples as compared to WS in order of CO > CONT > SO > WG > WS. Fatty acids present in the lipids appeared to form a complexed structure with amylose and inhibit the attack of digestive enzymes for hydrolysis. The findings of this study help to design food products with low digestibility and improved nutritional profiles. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	4	3005	3014	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00882-1					FSTA:2021-12-Le2100

Lytic capacity survey of commercial Listeria phage against Listeria spp. with varied genotypic and phenotypic characteristics.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Listeria monocytogenes is regularly isolated from food processing environments and is endemic in some facilities. Bacteriophage have potential as biocontrol strategies for L. monocytogenes. In this study, the lytic capacity of a commercial Listeria phage cocktail was evaluated against a library of 475 Listeria spp. Isolates (426 L. monocytogenes and 49 other Listeria spp.) with varied genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. The lytic capacity of the Listeria phages was measured by spot assays where lysis was scored on a scale of 0-3 (0=no lysis; 1=slight lysis; 2=moderate lysis; 3=confluent lysis). Only 5% of all tested Listeria spp. Isolates, including L. monocytogenes, were either moderately or highly susceptible (score 2 or 3) to lysis by Listeria phage when scores were averaged across temperature and phage concentration; 155 of 5700 treatment (multiplicity of infection [MOI] and temperature) and characteristic (genotype, sanitizer tolerance, and attachment capacity) combinations resulted in confluent lysis (score=3). Odds ratios for susceptibility to lysis were calculated using multinomial logistic regression. The odds of susceptibility to lysis by phage decreased (p< 0.05) if the L. monocytogenes isolate was previously found to persist or if the phage-bacteria culture was incubated at 30°C; neither isolate persistence or temperature was significant (p 0.05) when all factors were considered. In addition, lytic efficacy varied (p< 0.05) among pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) pulsotypes and may be affected by host MOI (p < 0.05). There was no effect (p> 0.05) of attachment capacity or sanitizer tolerance on phage susceptibility. This study underscores the complexity of using Listeria phage as a biocontrol for Listeria spp. in food processing facilities and highlights that phage susceptibility is most greatly impacted by genotype. Further studies are needed to evaluate these findings within a processing environment.										2021	18	6	413	418	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2897					FSTA:2021-10-Cd2992

Effect of SunGold kiwifruit and vitamin C consumption on ameliorating exercise-induced stress response in women.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Introduction. Markers of oxidative and psychological stress are elevated during high-intensity exercise. Additionally, when energy intake does not match expenditure, women who actively participate in sports and exercise are at risk of developing menstrual dysfunction, infertility, and osteoporosis. Vitamin C is known to reduce exercise-induced stress. Here, this study investigates the efficacy of consuming vitamin C from SunGold kiwifruit compared to in isolation, in ameliorating exercise-induced stress in recreationally active women. Methods and Results. Ten eumenorrheic women are recruited in this crossover study and attended three exercise and one rest trial. In the exercise trials, participants consumed 300 mg vitamin C from kiwifruit or drink, or have a placebo drink, followed by 30-min exercise on a cycle ergometer at 60% power. During rest visit, participants sat quietly and consumed a placebo drink. Salivary uric acid (oxidative stress) and cortisol (psychological stress) are measured before and immediately after exercise for 2 h. Both vitamin C and kiwifruit reduced exercise-induced uric acid, immediately after exercise. Vitamin C drink continued to decrease uric acid for a further 30 min and slightly attenuated exercise-induced cortisol. Conclusions. Consuming liquid vitamin C prior to high-intensity cycling appears more effective than eating kiwifruit, in ameliorating exercise-induced stress in recreationally active women of reproductive age. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	10			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202001219					FSTA:2021-09-Jg12397
J		Akan, S.; Ozdestan-Ocak, A.							Influence of grape seed extract on suppression of biogenic amine accumulation, chemical and color traits of wet tarhana during fermentation.		Food Bioscience					In this research, the influence of different replacement levels (0 g/kg, 4 g/kg, 8 g/kg, and 16 g/kg) of wheat flour with grape seed extract (GSE) on the changes in the concentration of individual and total biogenic amine content, total free amino acid content, total phenolic concentration, antioxidant capacity, chemical characteristics, and color values of tarhana during 15 days of fermentation were investigated. The amines were identified via high-performance liquid chromatography after being derivatized with benzoyl chloride, and quantified using the combined application of the internal standard and standard addition methods. Total amine concentrations of all samples tended to increase between the 5th and 10th days and then inclined to decrease. It was observed that as the replacement levels of wheat flour with GSE increased, the amounts of total biogenic amines decreased. Furthermore, the amine contents of all samples were at safe levels, and GSE was effective at improving the bioactive properties of wet tarhana. Based upon the overall assessment, a substitution of 8 g/kg of wheat flour with GSE can be recommended to reduce biogenic amines in wet tarhana without causing undesirable sensory characteristics.

J		Akanksha Singh; Eligar, S. M.							Bioactive feruloylated xylooligosaccharides derived from Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) bran with antiglycation and antioxidant properties.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Non-communicable diseases have a promising link with the glycated proteins and advanced glycation end products, which are formed during hyperglycemic conditions of diabetes mellitus. Consumption of whole grain millets serves as an aid in the management of lifestyle disorders. Despite being the most robust and widely cultivated millet grain and its position as a major food staple, there has been a lack of research on the effects of pearl millet on human health and disease prevention. Therefore, this study was aimed at utilizing pearl millet bran, an agro-industrial waste, to derive feruloylated xylooligosaccharides (FXOS) by enzymatic hydrolysis and examine their potential as a natural antioxidant and antiglycating agent. The isolated FXOS were composed of 25.19mg/g bound ferulic acid, 227.5mg/g arabinose, and 359.9mg/g xylose as the major monosaccharides besides 25.8mg/g glucose, 27.2mg/g galactose, and 14mg/g glucuronic acid with the total arabinoxylan content of 51.5%. FTIR analysis confirmed the presence of backbone having beta-glycosidic linkages and bound phenolic group. Further, antiglycation potential was studied with the help of inhibition of fructosamine and protein carbonyl formation and fluorescence measurements. FXOS showed a potent antiglycation effect in the bovine serum albumin (BSA) /glucose model with an inhibition rate of 54.6, 62.8, and 87.7% at 1mg/mL during the early, middle, and late stages of glycation, respectively. FXOS also inhibited protein aggregation, as confirmed by Thioflavin-T fluorescence measurements and SDS-PAGE. In addition, we evaluated the antioxidant property of FXOS by DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, superoxide radical scavenging, and ferrous ion chelating assays. Our findings suggest that FXOS from pearl millet bran can be utilized as a constituent of functional foods with antiglycation and antioxidant properties.

The East African highland cooking bananas "Matooke" preferences of farmers and traders: implications for variety development.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					"Matooke" is a staple food made from Highland cooking bananas in the Great Lakes region of East Africa. Genetic improvement of these bananas for resistance to pests and diseases has been a priority breeding objective. However, there is insufficient information on fruit quality characteristics that different users prefer, resulting in sub-optimal adoption of new varieties. This study identified matooke characteristics preferred by farmers and traders, using survey data from 123 farmers, 14 focus group discussions and 40 traders. Gender differences were considered. The main characteristics that were found to drive variety preferences were agronomic (big bunch, big fruits) and quality (soft texture, good taste, good aroma, yellow food). There were minimal geographical and gender differences for trait preferences. Quality characteristics need to be defined in terms of physical-chemical underpinnings so that breeding programmes can apply accurate high-throughput systems, thereby improving adoption and impact of new banana varieties. © 2020 The Authors.

Thin-layer drying of sadabahar (Catharanthus roseus) leaves using different drying techniques and fate of bioactive compounds.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Drying of Catharanthus roseus leaves offer easy utilization of its powder for medicinal purposes but is challenging due to temperature sensitivity of its bioactive constituents. In this work, C. roseus leaves were subjected to three economic drying techniques: solar, tray (40,50, 60 °C) and, microwave (450, 600, 900 W) to identify the best drying condition for retention of bioactives of C. roseus leaves. Semi-empirical models that best defined the drying conditions were identified. Results. Revealed lowest moisture content (~1.2% d. B.), drying time (4-8 min) and activation energy (36.92 kJ/mol) with high moisture diffusivity (~10-9 m2/s) for microwave drying. For retention of bioactives, solar drying in natural convection mode performed well and may serve as a low-cost drying strategy. However, leaves dried at 600 W microwave power showed higher antioxidants (152 mg TE/g), phenols (11.28 mg GAE/g), and flavonoids (59.69 mg/QE g) and is recommended for drying of C. roseus leaves. Practical application. Identification of suitable drying method and conditions for the production of Catharanthus roseus leaf powder can promote its large scale manufacturing while retaining its innate bioactive compounds. Addition of the said powder or its extract in neutraceutical, pharmaceutical formulations, and in oncological ailments can enhance health benefits as these leaves contain essential polyphenols and important dimeric alkaloids like vincristine and vinblastin etc. Optimum C. roseus processing conditions especially for solar and microwave drying can help farmers in producing value added medicinal food products at the field level for generation of additional revenue at lower process cost. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15140					FSTA:2021-06-Te2275

Food Research International					Excess intake of fructose may contribute to the high prevalence of metabolic disorder. In this study, we investigated the effects of kefir supplementation on the intestine-liver-adipose tissue axis in metabolic disorder induced by high-fructose diet in rats to describe mechanistic action and potential therapeutic value of kefir. Fructose was given to the rats as a 20% solution in drinking water for 15 weeks. Kefir was administrated by gastric gavage once a day during the final six weeks. Kefir supplementation improved metabolic parameters, including plasma triglyceride and insulin levels; hepatic weight, triglyceride content and fatty degeneration; omental fat mass in fructose-fed rats. Kefir supplementation decreased the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes in feces, as well as necrotic degeneration, expression levels of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF -kappaB), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), but increased expression of tight-junction proteins occludin and claudin-1, in the ileum of the fructose-fed rats. Kefir treatment also reduced the mRNA levels of key lipogenic genes sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-1c) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) together with a decline in expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), NF -kappaB, and glycosylated glycoprotein (CD68) in the liver. Moreover, kefir treatment improved insulin signaling at the level of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) and phospho-endothelial nitric oxide synthase (peNOS) as well as fructose transporters (GLUT2 and GLUT5) in the liver, but not in the adipose tissue, of high-fructose-fed rats. Consequently, kefir supplementation suppresses hepatic lipogenesis and inflammatory status, but promotes insulin signaling, in association with a change of the fecal microbiota and attenuation of the intestinal permeability factors in high-fructose-fed rats. Thus, we propose that kefir has favorable effects on the hepatic and intestinal irregularities induced by fructose overconsumption. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Akarca, G.; Istek, A.; Tomar, O.							The effect of resin coating on the quality characteristics of chicken eggs during storage.		Journal of Food Science					In this study, after washing, changes in the quality characteristics of chicken eggs coated with apricot, almond, and sour cherry tree resins were examined during two different temperatures (4 °C and 22 °C) storage for 60 days. While air cell height, weight loss, albumen and yolk pH and a* (redness) values increased in all samples during storage, Haugh unit, albumen and yolk index, shell fracture and vitelline membrane strength, albumen and yolk L* (lightness) and b* (yellowness) values decreased (P< 0.05). The lowest weight loss (0.54 g) and air cell height (2.89 mm), highest Haugh unit (73.95 HU), albumen index (8.81%), and yolk index (40.37%) were found in the samples coated with sour cherry wood resin stored at 4 °C. The shell breakage and vitelline membrane strength of the coated samples were determined to be higher than the control samples and the samples stored after washing. Higher weight loss, air cell height, and pH values, while lower Haugh unit, Albumen and yolk index were found in samples stored at 22 °C (P< 0.05). At the end of storage, the maximum increase in the counts of total aerobic mesophilic and psychrophilic bacteria was found in the albumin and egg yolk of washed samples stored at ambient temperature. As a result, the coating materials prepared with the resin of apricot, almond, and sour cherry trees were suitable for eggshell's shelf life extension. Practical Application. The consumers demand the eggs be in their freshest condition, but the currently available storage conditions are not sufficient to maintain freshness in many regions of Turkey. The physical, chemical and, microbiological qualities of the eggs coated with wood resins were determined to be superior compared to other samples. Because resins have good barrier properties, it is recommended to conduct extensive studies on their applicability in different products. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Akash Sinha; Gulshan Shrivastava; Prabhat Kumar							Architecting user-centric internet of things for smart agriculture.		International Sugar Journal					Recent advancement in the technology has paved the way for the optimization of traditional industrial practices. Agriculture sector continues to serve as the backbone of the global economy. Moreover, it is required to cater the ever increasing demand for the food products arising due to rapid growth of global population. This urges for the modernization of traditional agricultural methodologies. Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to become the key enabler for realizing the vision of Smart Agriculture. This paper proposes a user-centric IoT architecture for addressing the various issues faced in the agricultural domain. The proposed system allows the farmers to monitor their agricultural fields in real time and receive recommendations for producing good quality crops. The proposed architecture also optimizes the food supply chain in a manner that allows the farmers to maximize their overall profit on the sold goods. The applicability of the proposed architecture is evaluated using multiple uses cases encompassing the different aspects of the agriculture process. The paper also proposes a novel framework for smartphones that would facilitate the software engineers to develop applications required for implementing various functionality of the proposed system.										2021	123	1467			0020-8841				10.1016/lj.suscom.2019.07.001					FSTA:2021-07-Dg0822

Impact of an olive leaf polyphenol 3,4-DHPEA-EDA on physical properties of food protein gels.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A cold-water extract of olive leaves (Olea europaea L.) is useful as a texture-improving agent for food protein gels. In this work, the compound contributing to the improvement of gel properties was investigated by using the egg white gel (EWG) as a model for food protein gels. Adding 1.0% (w/v) cold-water extract (OLEx) greatly improved the elasticity (2.1 times), viscosity (4.5 times), and breaking stress (1.4 times) of the EWG. Chemical analyses of the protein revealed that the enhancement of physical properties by OLEx was attributed to protein cross-linking activity of polyphenols. LC/MS and NMR analyses indicated that a major protein cross-linker is the dialdehydic form of demethoxycarbonylelenolic acid linked to hydroxytyrosol (3,4-DHPEA-EDA), which is an aglycone derived from oleuropein, a major polyphenol of olive leaves. These results suggest that 3,4-DHPEA-EDA generated by cold-water extraction from the leaf improves the physical properties, that is, texture, of protein gels.

Experimental study on classical and metaheuristics algorithms for optimal nano-chitosan concentration selection in surface coating and food packaging.		Food Chemistry					In this study the Lagrange interpolation optimization algorithm based on two variables with respect to all experimental replicates (POA), was compared with two other heuristics methods (WOA and GOA). Modification of the apple surface by an edible nano coating solution in food packaging was used as case study. The experiment was performed as a factorial test based on completely randomized design by 100 permutations data sets. Results. Showed a significant difference between the three optimization methods (POA, WOA and GOA) which indicates the necessity of optimization and also efficiency of the present POA. The optimum result by POA, similar to a rose petal property, could rise 72% in surface contact angle (CA). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the derived surfaces showed almost a uniform spherical nanoparticles morphology. Remarkable advantages of this new approach are no additional material requirement, healthful, easy, inexpensive, fast and affordable technique for surface improvement.

J		Akbar Jokar; Hasan Barzegar; Maftoon Azad, N.; Maryam Shahamirian							Effects of cinnamon essential oil and Persian gum on preservation of pomegranate arils.		Food Science & Nutrition					Given the high perishability of pomegranate arils, edible antimicrobial coating will enhance their shelf life and maintain their marketability. An antimicrobial coating was prepared using 1% (w/v) soluble part of Persian gum (PG) and different concentrations (0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75% (v/v)) of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) to extend the shelf life of pomegranate arils. Microbiological, chemical, physical, and sensorial characteristics of coated and uncoated samples were evaluated at 7-day intervals. Total anthocyanin (TAN), titrable acidity (TA), and ascorbic acid showed a decreasing trend, during the whole period of the storage. TAN, TA, and ascorbic acid decreased from 119.8 to 44.5 mg/L, 1.6% to 1.37%, and 682 to 140 mg/L, respectively. Firmness increased during the storage time, while total soluble solids (TSS, around 17.4 °Brix) and total phenolic compounds (TP, around 14.21 mg/100 ml) showed no significant changes with CEO concentrations. Coatings containing 0.5% and 0.75% CEO significantly prevented fungal growth on the samples at least for 3 weeks and 3 months, respectively. Optimization proved that 1-week cold storage and 0.43% CEO could dramatically meet 80% of the research targets including maximum nutritional quality and freshness, as well preventing microbial spoilage. It was concluded that coating the pomegranate arils by PG and selecting an appropriate concentration of the CEO could considerably increase shelf life, marketability, and nutritional quality of pomegranate arils at a suitable and acceptable level. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Akca, S.; Akpinar, A.							The effects of grape, pomegranate, sesame seed powder and their oils on probiotic ice cream: total phenolic contents, antioxidant activity and probiotic viability.		Food Bioscience					The present study aimed to produce probiotic ice cream, containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subps. lactis BB12 as the starter cultures, by adding vegetable seed pulp powder (sesame, pomegranate seed, and grape seed) and oils of these seeds to the ice cream mixtures and to examine the effects of these additions on pH, acidity, total phenolic content, flavonoid content, antioxidant capacity and the probiotic viability of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subps. lactis BB12 in ice cream samples stored at -20 °C for 90 days. Total phenolic content, flavonoid content, and antioxidant capacity were evaluated on the first and last day of the storage. Vegetable seed powders and oils did not affect the pH and acidity values of the ice cream samples. The pulp powders and oils used contributed to preserving the viability of probiotic bacteria during storage. Among the seed pulp powders, the grape seed had the highest phenolic content and antioxidant activity. Especially, ice creams containing grape seed powder, grape seed powder+ seed oil, and pomegranate seed powder promoted the development of probiotic microorganisms in these ice cream samples due to the high phenolic components and antioxidant activity. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of seed powders and oils were parallel to the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of ice creams produced using these powders and oils. It can be concluded that grape seed powder and its oil can be used as a natural ingredient to develop a novel ice cream with high nutritional antioxidant activity.

J		Akcicek, A.; Bozkurt, F.; Akgul, C.; Karasu, S.							Encapsulation of olive pomace extract in rocket seed gum and chia seed gum nanoparticles: characterization, antioxidant activity and oxidative stability.		Foods					The aim of this study was to determine the potential use of rocket seed and chia seed gum as wall materials, to encapsulate and to prevent degradation of olive pomace extract (OPE) in polymeric nanoparticles, and to characterize olive pomace extract-loaded rocket seed gum nanoparticles (RSGNPs) and chia seed gum nanoparticles (CSGNPs). The phenolic profile of olive pomace extract and physicochemical properties of olive pomace, rocket seed gum (RSG), and chia seed gum (CSG) were determined. The characterization of the nanoparticles was performed using particle size and zeta potential measurement, differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), encapsulation efficiency (EE%), in vitro release, and antioxidant activity analyses. Nanoparticles were used to form oil in water Pickering emulsions and were evaluated by oxitest. The RSGNPs and CSGNPs showed spherical shape in irregular form, had an average size 3183.11 nm and 4908.67 nm, and zeta potential values of -22.61.23 and -29.92.57, 25 respectively. The encapsulation efficiency of the RSGNPs and CSGNPs were found to be 67.014.29% and 82.864.13%, respectively. The OPE-RSGNP and OPE-CSGNP presented peaks at the 1248 cm-1 and 1350 cm-1 which represented that C-O groups and deformation of OH, respectively, shifted compared to the OPE (1252.53 cm-1 and 1394.69 cm-1). The shift in wave numbers showed interactions of a phenolic compound of OPE within the RSG and CSG, respectively. In vitro release study showed that the encapsulation of OPE in RSGNPs and CSGNPs led to a delay of the OPE released in physiological pH. The total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity of RSGNPs and CSGNPs increased when the OPE-loaded RSGNPs and CSGNPs were formed. The encapsulation of OPE in RSGNPs and CSGNPs and the IP values of the oil in water Pickering emulsions containing OPE-RSGNPs and OPE-CSGNPs were higher than OPE, proving that OPE-loaded RSGNPs and CSGNPs significantly increased oxidative stability of Pickering emulsions. These results suggest that the RSG and CSG could have the potential to be utilized as wall materials for nanoencapsulation and prevent degradation of cold-pressed olive pomace phenolic extract. © 2021 by the authors.

M.; Mahuku, G.; Chikoye, D.; Ranajit Bandyopadhyay							Prevalence of aflatoxin- and fumonisin- producing fungi associated with cereal crops grown in Zimbabwe and their associated risks in a climate change scenario.		Foods					In most sub-Saharan African countries, staple cereal grains harbor many fungi and some produce mycotoxins that negatively impact health and trade. Maize and three small grain cereals (sorghum, pearl millet, and finger millet) produced by smallholder farmers in Zimbabwe during 2016 and 2017 were examined for fungal community structure, and total aflatoxin (AF) and fumonisin (FM) content. A total of 800 maize and 180 small grain samples were collected at harvest and during storage from four agroecological zones. Fusarium spp. dominated the fungi associated with maize. Across crops, Aspergillus flavus constituted the main Aspergillus spp. Small grain cereals were less susceptible to both AF and FM. AF (52%) and FM (89%) prevalence was higher in maize than in small grains (13-25% for AF and 0-32% for FM). Less than 2% of small grain samples exceeded the EU regulatory limit for AF (4 g/kg), while <10% exceeded the EU regulatory limit for FM (1000 g/kg). For maize, 28% and 54% of samples exceeded AF and FM Codex guidance limits, respectively. Higher AF contamination occurred in the drier and hotter areas while more FM occurred in the wetter year. AF exposure risk assessment revealed that small grain consumption posed low health risks (≤0.02 liver cancer cases/100,000 persons/year) while maize consumption potentially caused higher liver cancer rates of up to 9.2 cases/100,000 persons/year depending on the locality. Additionally, FM hazard quotients from maize consumption among children and adults were high in both years, but more so in a wet year than a dry year. Adoption of AF and FM management practices throughout the maize value chain coupled with policies supporting dietary diversification are needed to protect maize consumers in Zimbabwe from AF-and FM-associated health effects. The higher risk of health burden from diseases associated with elevated concentration of mycotoxins in preferred maize during climate change events can be relieved by increased consumption of small grains. © 2021 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Effects of cassava variety on chemical composition and consumer acceptability of gari were investigated. Three traditional cassava varieties Bonoua 2, Yace and Yavo as well as four improved cassava varieties Bocou 1, Bocou 2, Bocou 3 and TMS (2) 1425 were evaluated. All the varieties had appreciable high value of carbohydrates ranged from 86.6% (TMS (2) 1425) to 90.89% (Bonoua 2). TMS (2) 1425 had the lowest reducing sugar value (0.22%) while Bocou 3 had the highest reducing sugar value (0.38%). Studied gari exhibited low value of hydrogen cyanide with the lowest value found in Bocou 1 (1.53 mg per 100 g). Total fibre value varied to 2.88% (Yace) to 2.28% (Bocou 2). Gari of Bocou 1 and Bocou 3 were the most appreciated. These gari had fairly sweet taste, were fairly bright and contained few impurities. This study demonstrated that cassava variety influenced the chemical composition and consumer acceptability of gari. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Akert, F. S.; Kreuzer, M.; Kunz, C.; Reidy, B.; Berard, J.							Effects of full-time v. part-time grazing on seasonal changes in milk coagulation properties and fatty acid composition.		Journal of Dairy Research					For this research communication our objective was to investigate to what extent milk coagulation properties and milk fatty acid (FA) composition were affected by different feeding systems, season and their interaction. Eighteen cows in total were subjected to one of three different feeding system treatments: full-time grazing or part-time grazing combined with indoor feeding of fresh grass with low or high concentrate supplementation. Milk was sampled in spring, summer and autumn. Milk coagulation time was 15.0, 19.0 and 17.7 min, coagulation dynamics 1.67, 3.41 and 1.79 min, and curd firmness 52.7, 32.4 and 47.0 mm in spring, summer and autumn, respectively. Thus, milk coagulation properties of the milk were lower during summer. There were strong seasonal effects on milk FA proportions, but there were not always changes with progressing season, or changes were different with respect to the impact of the feeding systems (system*season interaction). The milk fat was favourably rich in oleic acid, conjugated linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid and had a low n-6/ n-3 fatty acid ratio in all systems. Factors like seasonal variations in grass composition and the energy balance of the cows were considered relevant for the milk FA composition. Overall, seasonal variations in milk quality were less pronounced with part-time grazing with fresh grass indoors as compared to full-time grazing without concentrate. © The Author(s), 2021.

Application of L-asparaginase to produce high-quality Turkish coffee and the role of precursors in acrylamide formation.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, the optimized conditions for L-asparaginase treatment on Arabica coffee beans and the impacts of two independent variables (enzyme dosage and treatment time) on five dependent variables (acrylamide, 2-Acetyl-3-Methylpyrazine, 2,3-Dimethylpyrazine, 2,5-Dimethylpyrazine, and 2-Methylpyrazine) were investigated by employing RSM. Green coffee beans were treated with L-asparaginase at various dosages (0-4000 ASNU/kg green bean) and times (30-120 min). Statistical analysis indicated that levels of responses were significantly related to enzyme dosage and treatment time (p<.05). These independent parameters had a significant influence on the quantity of acrylamide in Turkish coffee (p<.05), but enzyme dosage was found to be more effective (p<.01). The optimum conditions of L-asparaginase treatment for producing superior quality Turkish coffee were determined as 2,126.4 ASNU/kg green bean and 82.73 min. Also, a moderate positive correlation (r=0.669, p<.01) was found between the asparagine concentration in green coffee beans and acrylamide content of coffees produced from these beans. Practical applications. The use of asparaginase seems a good solution for acrylamide mitigation in foods. However, various factors including application dosage and time should be taken into consideration when using this enzyme in food manufacture. There is a need to examine the effect of these parameters to optimize the enzyme application conditions in coffee beans. Knowledge about optimum conditions for asparaginase treatment may be applied in the production of high-quality Turkish coffee with low acrylamide and high pyrazine concentration. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			karatas, ayse binnur/0000-0001-7750-5427; ARICI, MUHAMMET/0000-0003-4126-200X; AKGUN, BANU/0000-0001-7451-7174							2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15486					FSTA:2021-10-Hn9523
J		Akgun, N.; Celik, A. F.; Kelebekli, L.							Physicochemical properties, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of chestnut, rhododendron, acacia and multifloral honey.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this study is to investigate the physicochemical properties, antioxidant activities, and total phenolic contents of the plateau (multifloral), chestnut, rhododendron, and acacia honey collected from Ordu province in Turkey. The rhododendron honey had the highest acidity (p<0.05) while the chestnut honey showed the highest conductivity (1.130.25 mS/cm) among all (p<0.05). The highest diastase activities and the lowest HMF contents were determined in the multifloral and chestnut honey. Considering the DPPH and FRAP assays, the multifloral honey showed the highest antioxidant activity. Accordingly, the highest total phenolic content was determined in the multifloral honey followed by rhododendron, chestnut, and acacia honey. A moderate correlation was determined between the total phenolic content and antioxidant activities (r=0.575 for FRAP and r=0.697 for DPPH). Consequently, the plateau honey could be recommended for nutritional and health purposes due to its relatively higher antioxidant activity and total phenolic content together with relatively lower HMF content and higher diastase activity. Considering that Ordu is the largest honey producer city in Turkey, the second top honey producer country, this work could shed light for future studies and be taken as a reference providing insights on the characteristics of different types of honey for both local and worldwide producers. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Modified atmosphere packaging and related technologies are increasingly used to extend shelf-life of fresh products. This paper covers the effect of such techniques on increasing shelf life. Salad-cut lettuce was washed in different solutions for a period of 1 min. Then, salad-cut lettuce was packed in modified atmosphere (3-5% CO2, 3-5% O2, 97-95% N2) and stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Quality indicators of packaged lettuce including color, texture, sensory properties, total phenol content and antioxidant activity were analyzed at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 days of storage. This study showed that combination of sodium hypochlorite and ascorbic acid was the best treatment to maintain most of the qualitative indicators of lettuce during storage at 4 °C (p<0.05). Ascorbic acid and cysteine caused synergistic effect in preventing oxidation. Treatments containing calcium lactate and heat shock, caused better crispiness till the 9th day of storage. According to the results of current study, application of MAP alongside implementation of food grade chemicals showed to be remarkably effective in increasing the shelf life of lettuce. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Fatty acid prediction in bovine milk by attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy after solvent-free lipid separation.		Foods					In the present study, a novel approach for mid-infrared (IR)-based prediction of bovine milk fatty acid composition is introduced. A rapid, solvent-free, two-step centrifugation method was applied in order to obtain representative milk fat fractions. IR spectra of pure milk lipids were recorded with attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FT-IR) spectroscopy. Comparison to the IR transmission spectra of whole milk revealed a higher amount of significant spectral information for fatty acid analysis. Partial least squares (PLS) regression models were calculated to relate the IR spectra to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) reference values, providing particularly good predictions for fatty acid sum parameters as well as for the following individual fatty acids: C10:0 (R2P = 0.99), C12:0 (R2P = 0.97), C14:0 (R2P = 0.88), C16:0 (R2P = 0.81), C18:0 (R2P = 0.93), and C18:1cis (R2P = 0.95). The IR wavenumber ranges for the individual regression models were optimized and validated by calculation of the PLS selectivity ratio. Based on a set of 45 milk samples, the obtained PLS figures of merit are significantly better than those reported in literature using whole milk transmission spectra and larger datasets. In this context, direct IR measurement of the milk fat fraction inherently eliminates covariation structures between fatty acids and total fat content, which poses a common problem in IR-based milk fat profiling.

Phenylpropanoid metabolism in astringent and nonastringent persimmon (Diospyros kaki) cultivars determines sensitivity to Alternaria infection.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Fruits of nonastringent persimmon cultivars, as compared to astringent ones, were more resistant to Alternaria infection despite having lower polyphenol content. Metabolic analysis from the pulp of nonastringent "Shinshu", as compared to the astringent "Triumph", revealed a higher concentration of salicylic, coumaric, quinic, 5-o-feruloyl quinic, ferulic acids, beta-glucogallin, gallocatechin, catechin, and procyanidins. Selected compounds like salicylic, ferulic, and rho-coumaric acids inhibited in vitro Alternaria growth, and higher activity was demonstrated for methyl ferulic and methyl rho-coumaric acids. These compounds also reduced in vivo Alternaria growth and the black spot disease in stored fruits. On the other hand, methyl gallic acid was a predominant compound in the "Triumph" pulp, as compared to the "Shinshu" pulp, and it augmented Alternaria growth in vitro and in vivo. Our results might explain the high sensitivity of the cultivar "Triumph" to Alternaria. It also emphasizes that specific phenolic compounds, and not the total phenol, affect susceptibility to fungal infection.										2021	69	20	5628	5637	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c01312					FSTA:2021-10-Jg13285

Journal of Food Science					Twenty-four strains were isolated from 50 samples of raw cow's milk originated from different regions of Morocco. After different screening methods, one strain was selected as the highest exopolysaccharide (EPS)-producing isolate and was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing as Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus P14. Moreover, the EPS-producing ability, bacterial growth, and pH of the medium were monitored. The optimization of culture conditions indicated that the high yield of EPS was 685.14 mg/L obtained at 42 °C, with lactose as a carbon source. The characterization study showed that the purified EPS consisted of one main fraction that contained 97.67% of carbohydrates. Furthermore, the EPS was identified as a homogeneous polysaccharide, mainly composed of glucose. These results demonstrated the high EPS production ability of the selected L. rhamnosus P14, representing a promising candidate to improve the textural and sensory properties of fermented food. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In a world constantly challenged by climate change, corn and sorghum are two important grains because of their high productivity and adaptability, and their multifunctional use for different purposes such as human food, animal feed, and feedstock for many industrial products and biofuels. Corn and sorghum can be utilized interchangeably in certain applications; one grain may be preferred over the other for several reasons. The determination of the composition corn and sorghum flour mixtures may be necessary for economic, regulatory, environmental, functional, or nutritional reasons. Results. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) in combination with chemometrics, was used for the classification of flour samples based on the LIBS spectra of flour types and mixtures using partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and the determination of the sorghum ratio in sorghum/corn flour mixture based on their elemental composition using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy with PLS-DA successfully identified the samples as either pure corn, pure sorghum, or corn-sorghum mixtures. Moreover, the addition of various levels of sorghum flour to mixtures of corn-sorghum flour were used for PLS analysis. The coefficient of determination values of calibration and validation PLS models are 0.979 and 0.965, respectively. The limit of detection of the PLS models is 4.36%. Conclusion. This study offers a rapid method for the determination of the sorghum level in corn-sorghum flour mixtures and the classification of flour samples with high accuracy, a short analysis time, and no requirement for time-consuming sample preparation procedures. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					The effect of a multicomponent nutraceutical on cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury in male Wistar rats was investigated. Animals were administered with the nutraceutical, Trevo, for 7 days before 30 min of bilateral common carotid artery occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia and 24 hr of reperfusion. Behavioral assessment, biochemical estimations in the brain cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, and hippocampal histopathological evaluation were carried out after treatments. Results. Showed that ischemia/reperfusion-induced motor and cognitive deficits were abated in rats pretreated with Trevo. Additionally, prophylaxis with Trevo blunted ischemia/reperfusion-induced redox stress, proinflammatory events, disturbances in neurotransmitter metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and histoarchitectural aberrations in the discreet brain regions. In summary, supplementation with Trevo provided neuroprotection to rats against transient cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury and could be explored as a promising approach in stroke prevention. Practical applications. There is a worldwide increase in the incidence of cerebral ischemia or stroke. Although an advanced health care system and effective control of risk factors have led to the declining incidence in developed nations, a definitive cure for stroke remains elusive and the situation is growing worse in developing nations. The results of the present study revealed that supplementation with Trevo ameliorated neurobehavioral, neurochemical, and histopathological consequences of brain ischemia/reperfusion injury and could, therefore, be beneficial in stroke prevention and management. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			/0000-0003-0901-1235							2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13351					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10996

Toxicological and pharmacological assessment of a multiherbal phytopharmaceutical on Triton X-1339-induced hyperlipidemia and allied biochemical dysfunctions.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study investigated the safety and therapeutic effect of a multiherbal tea (MHT) on Triton X-1339-induced hyperlipidemia and associated biochemical and tissue dysfunctions. An infusion of the MHT was assessed for phytoconstituents, proximate and mineral composition, and antioxidant activity. Wistar rats administered 200 mg/kg Triton X-1399 were post-treated with MHT for 14 days followed by biochemical estimations in serum, heart, liver, and kidney of animals. Hematological and histopathological evaluations of the blood, and liver, respectively, were also performed. Different phytochemicals were detected in MHT, toxic metals were absent and antioxidant activity was appreciable. Disturbances in glucose level and redox homeostasis, alterations in liver, kidney, and heart function markers, and imbalances in hematological parameters precipitated by triton toxicity were mitigated by posttreatment with MHT. Multiherbal tea also ameliorated triton-induced hepatic histoarchitectural abnormalities. These results suggest that MHT is apparently an effective antilipemic tea with minimal or no side effects. Practical applications. Hyperlipidemia is one of the core risk factors for arteriosclerosis and a major contributor to other adverse health conditions. The prevalence of hyperlipidemia has increased drastically in the last few decades. Plant and plant products have been extensively used in the management of dyslipidemia and many plant-based antilipemic products with poorly defined toxicity and pharmacological profiles abound in the market. The results of this study demonstrated the protective effects of a MHT against triton-induced hyperlipidemia, atherogenic tendency, and dysfunction of key organs in rats and lent credence to its therapeutic relevance in the management of hyperlipidemia and related diseases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.			/0000-0003-0901-1235							2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13238					FSTA:2021-07-Hn7293
J		Akinola, S. A.; Ateba, C. N.; Mwanza, M.							Behaviour of Aspergillus parasiticus in aflatoxin production as influenced by storage parameters using response surface methodology approach.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Aspergillus parasiticus is a pre-harvest and postharvest pathogen that is known to produce aflatoxin; however, it is less studied compared to A. flavus. Inappropriate storage conditions are a cause of food spoilage and growth of mycotoxigenic fungi especially in low moisture foods thus constituting hazards to health. Hence, this study investigated the behaviour of A. parasiticus on aflatoxin production in inoculated wheat flour as influenced by storage conditions using the response surface methodology. Twenty experimental runs consisting of independent variables (incubation temperature (A), time (B) and (C) moisture content) and responses (aflatoxin concentrations, i.e., AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, AFG2 and AFTOT) were developed. A central composite face-centered design was used with lower and upper limits: A (25-35 °C), B (7-15 days) and C (15-25%), while the non-inoculated wheat flour served as the negative control. Aflatoxin production was determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) according to standard procedures. Numerical and graphical process variables were optimized, adequate models were predicted and optimal point prediction for aflatoxin concentration was determined. AFG1 concentrations ranged from 1.10 to 360.06 mug/g, AFG2 (0.91-446.94 mug/g), AFB2 (7.95-488.77 mug/g), AFB1 (17.21-20,666.6 mug/g) and AFTOT (15.91-21,851.09 mug/g). Aflatoxin concentration increased with increase in "B" and "A" but decreased with prolonged increase in "B". AFB1 concentrations in A. parasiticus inoculated wheat flour increased at prolonged "B" and "A" at constant moisture (12.09%). A reduced cubic model was significantly adequate to describe the relationship between process variables and responses (AFG1 and AFG2), cubic model (AFB1 and AFTOT) and a transformed square root cubic model for AFG2 concentrations (p≤0.05). "A" influenced AFG1 production more than "C" while "C" and "A" had no significant effect on AFG2 production. Process variables "AB" influenced AFB2 concentrations more than "C" while "A" had a more significant effect on the AFTOT production than "B" (p≤0.05). The predicted (R2) and adjusted coefficient of regression (adj R2) were in reasonable agreement. After optimal point prediction and validation, minimum aflatoxin concentration≤0 mug/g could be achieved at the predicted conditions (A=30.42 °C, B=10.58 days and C=14.49%) except in AFG2 (3.33 mug/g).

J		Akinola, S. A.; Ayangbenro, A. S.; Babalola, O. O.							The diverse functional genes of maize rhizosphere microbiota assessed using shotgun metagenomics.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The geographical diversification in chemical, biological and physical properties of plant biospheres instigates heterogenicity in the proliferation of important soil microbiome. Controlling functions and structure of plant rhizosphere from a better understanding and prediction of a plant's immediate environment will help assess plant-microbe interplay, improve the productivity of plant ecosystems and improve plant response to adverse soil conditions. Here we characterized functional genes of the microbial community of maize rhizosphere using a culture-independent method. Results. Our metadata showed microbial genes involved in nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, quorum sensing molecules, trehalose, siderophore production, phenazine biosynthesis protein, daunorubicin resistance, acetoin, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase, 4-hydroxybenzoate, disease control and stress-reducing genes (superoxidase dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, etc.). beta-Diversity showed that there is a highly significant difference between most of the genes mined from rhizosphere soil samples and surrounding soils. Conclusions. The high relative abundance of stress-reducing genes mined from this study showed that the sampling sites harbor not only important plant-beneficial organisms but also a hotspot for developing bio-fertilizers. Nevertheless, since most of these organisms are unculturable, mapping cultivation strategies for their growth could make them readily available as bio-inoculants and possible biotechnological applications in the future. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Effect of parboiling and drying pretreatment on the cooking time and quality attributes of bambara groundnut.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Bambara groundnut (BGN) was separately parboiled for 45 and 90 min, then, sun-, oven-, or freeze-dried. Untreated BGN served as the control. Cooking, physical, chemical, and sensory characteristics were investigated to assess quality. All parboiled-dried samples cooked significantly (p ≤.05) faster (43%-86%) than the control. Freeze-dried samples showed significantly (p ≤.05) higher L* values than their sun- and oven-dried counterparts, irrespective of parboiling time. Sphericity and aspect ratio significantly (p ≤.05) reduced with all the drying methods, though insignificantly when parboiling was extended from 45 to 90 min. Pretreated BGN had higher protein but lower antinutrient contents. Mineral leaching was minimal at 45 min parboiling. Parboiled-dried BGN cooked samples were generally accepted by the panelists as demonstrated by scores of >6 on a 1-9 Hedonic scale. Combined parboiling and (sun-or oven-) drying presents a practicable strategy for BGN farmers/processors to offer an easy-to-cook product, potentially storable for later food preparation by consumers. Practical applications. The study provides a useful strategy to farmers/food industries in their quest to meet the increasing demand of consumers for more convenience foods as opposed to the drudgery associated with the long cooking time of Bambara groundnut. Combined parboiling and drying operations produced Bambara groundnut seeds which cooked 43%-86% faster, and had storable potential for later food preparation. The results from the study may enhance the research efforts in recent times aimed at further promoting the utilization of the crop for better food and nutrition security, particularly in regions where its cultivation is favored. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Egg case concentrate of Mantis religiosa abrogates the accumulation of cadmium in muscular and bone tissues of African catfish via activation of nitric oxide and myeloperoxidase activity.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The study examined the prophylactic effect of praying mantis egg case powder (PMECP) against the accumulation of cadmium (Cd) in key tissues of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). Thirty African catfish were randomly distributed into six (n=5) groups. Group I was treated with normal fish diet (NFD) only. Group II was exposed to Cd+ NFD. Group III was exposed to Cd+ NFD+ EC50 PMECP. Group IV was exposed to Cd+ NFD+ EC50 PMECP+ 10% EC50 PMECP. Group V was exposed to Cd+ NFD+ EC50 PMECP+ 20% EC50 PMECP. Group VI was treated with EC50 PMECP+ NFD for 14 days. Inhibitory concentration (IC50) of PMECP significantly scavenged free radicals in vitro with corresponding increase in the activity of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and nitric oxide (NO) level. PMECP also showed highest growth-rate pattern and downregulation of cavitation within the lamellae. Hence, PMECP may be a prophylactic agent against the Cd accumulation in African catfish. Practical applications: Mantis religiosa egg case is widely used in Asian traditional medicine and some part of West Africa, as prevention against several diseases such as urinary disorders, infertility, impotence, and shingles. Our previous investigation showed that Mantis religiosa egg case flour could prevent hepatotoxicity, inhibit respiratory dysfunction, and interrupt oxidative damage in lungs. It is also commonly utilized for its high protein content and clear airways potential. The results of this study revealed empirical evidence concerning the possible usage of PMECP as natural, alternative, and/or complementary protein supplement with prophylactic potentials. Hence, this study underlines PMECP as prophylactic agent in abrogating the accumulation of cadmium as well as improving the protein content in African catfish. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13287					FSTA:2021-07-Rc2590

Amino acid composition and antioxidant properties of the enzymatic hydrolysate of calabash nutmeg (Monodora myristica) and its membrane ultrafiltration peptide fractions.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The aim of this work was to determine amino acid composition and in vitro antioxidant activities of Monodora myristica protein hydrolysate and its membrane ultrafiltration peptide fractions. The Alcalase hydrolysate was fractionated using ultrafiltration membranes to produce peptide sizes of <1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa. The results showed that sequential fractionation resulted in higher glycine and glutamic acid and glutamine contents. Analysis of in vitro antioxidant properties showed that fractionation of the M. myristica hydrolysate led to significant (p< 0.05) improvements in 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging, metal chelation activity, ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), and hydroxyl (OH) radical scavenging activity. Linoleic acid oxidation was significantly (p< 0.05) attenuated by the peptide fractions. We conclude that peptide antioxidant activities were significantly (p< 0.05) improved by membrane fractionation, especially the 3-5 kDa fraction. Practical applications. The use of protein hydrolysate fractions with potential to prevent oxidation, which can reduce shelf life of foods and cause degenerate diseases due to cell damage is proposed for Monodora myristica. The demand for natural products and negative health issues associated with artificial food ingredients have led to increased consumer preference for natural sources of antioxidants. The protein hydrolysate and membrane fractions produced in this work showed high antioxidant ability that could qualify them to replace toxic synthetic antioxidants in foods. Peptide fractions had better metal chelation than the hydrolysates, which is important because chelation of metal ions can decrease the amount of free iron available to participate in the Fenton reaction and ultimately decrease the formation of toxic free radicals. Incorporation of the peptides into foods will enhance scavenging of toxic free radicals that may form during storage, thereby improving product freshness and shelf life in addition to preventing human degenerative diseases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Impact of traditional processing on proximate composition, folate, mineral, phytate, and alpha-galacto-oligosaccharide contents of two West African cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L. Walp) based doughnuts.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Doughnuts made from cowpea, a highly nutritious pulse, are frequently consumed in West Africa. As processing may affect their nutritional composition, cowpea processing into two doughnut types (ata and ata-doco) was characterized, and samples collected from 12 producers in Cotonou, Benin. Proximate composition, folate, mineral, phytate, and alpha-galacto-oligosaccharide contents were determined in the raw material, intermediate products, and doughnuts. Mass balance was assessed during ata production to monitor folate and alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides distribution, and to determine what steps most influenced their concentration. Ata was prepared with dehulled-soaked seeds, and ata-doco with whole or partially dehulled, non-soaked and dry-milled seeds. After both types of doughnuts production, lipid content increased by 11-33 times compared with raw seeds, due to oil absorption during deep-frying. Milling led to an increase of iron content by 50-57% (ata) and 21-75% (ata-doco production). Alpha-galacto-oligosaccharide contents decreased by 22-57% after whipping during ata-doco, but not during ata production. The mass balance assessment showed significant reductions of folate (-50%) and alpha-galacto-oligosaccharides (-33%) after dehulled seed washing and soaking during ata production. This study showed that the impact of traditional processing on the nutritional value of cowpea-based doughnuts is strong, but highly variable depending on the doughnut type and producers' practices.

Food Chemistry					Flours were made from the sprouted seeds of the low-and high-tannin faba bean cultivars Fabelle, FB9-4, Snowbird, and Snowdrop. Headspace measurements on sprouted flours found the most favourable aroma profiles following 48 h sprouting and 24 h drying at 60°C. Lipoxygenase activity, and the tannin, protein, and moisture contents were determined for unsprouted and sprouted faba bean flours. Lipoxygenase activity was higher in sprouted seeds before drying. Protein content increased after sprouting, whereas the tannin content decreased, especially for high-tannin varieties. Key volatile flavour compounds of faba bean flours included pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, nonanal, decanal, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, 3-methylbutanal, phenyl acetaldehyde, 3-methylbutyric acid, d-limonene, beta-linalool, menthol, and estragole; these include oxidative degradation products of oleic, linoleic, and some amino acids. An overall flavour improvement was achieved after germination, as indicated by a decrease in bitter compounds (tannins) and beany flavours (hexanal, nonanal, 2-heptanone, and 2-pentylfuran).

Journal of Food Science					Pectin-wax-based emulsion systems could be used to form edible films and coatings with desired water permeability characteristics. Pectin is often used in food industry due to its gelling and viscosity increasing properties. Physical properties of pectin are highly dependent on its esterification degree. Waxes are commonly used as edible coatings to enhance the water barrier properties of food products. This study focuses on preparing emulsions with sunflower oil wax (SFW) and high methoxyl pectin (HMP) at different concentrations for any possible edible film or coating formulations. Sunflower oil (SFO) was added as the dispersed oil phase to these emulsions. Characterization of the emulsions was performed by using particle size, rheology, and time domain nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry measurements. Effects of HMP concentration and the presence of SFO in the emulsion formulations were explored. Mean particle size values were recorded between 1 and 3 m. Rheology measurements showed that increasing HMP concentrations and presence of SFO in emulsions resulted in more pseudoplastic behavior. NMR transverse relaxation times (T2) were measured to detect the differences between the emulsions. Relaxation spectrum analysis was also conducted for a detailed understanding of the transverse relaxations. Addition of SFO and higher HMP concentrations decreased the T2 values of the emulsion systems (P< 0.05). However, T2 decreasing effect of SFO was compensated at 10% (w/w) HMP concentration showing that SFO was well dispersed in this particular emulsion formulation. Changes in the rheological behavior and relaxation times provided insight on the formation and stability of the emulsions. Practical Application. Findings of this study can be utilized and integrated to produce edible films and coatings with different water permeability characteristics. This study showed that NMR relaxometry parameters were also effective in monitoring and determining the physical characteristics of the pectin-wax-based emulsion systems as other conventional techniques including rheology and particle size measurements. Our NMR relaxometry findings were in correlation with the flow behavior and particle size results of the investigated emulsion systems. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.

Contribution of casein micelle size and proteolysis on protein distribution and sediment formation in UHT milk during storage.		International Dairy Journal					Formation of sediment in ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk has recently been associated with native casein (CN) micelle size and protein composition. This study investigates changes in the protein composition in sub-fractions of UHT treated milk, including sediment, during storage at 40 °C for up to 6 months of milk prepared from milk with either small or large CN micelles. The proteins in sediment were mainly alphaS1-CN and beta-CN and low levels of beta-lactoglobulin. The increase of CNs in the soluble phase caused by processing was higher for milk with large native CN micelles. The level of C-terminal derived kappa-CN peptides was positively correlated to the level of sediment in the milk. This indicates higher level of removal of kappa-CN from the CN micelle with large native size may destabilise the CN micelles causing formation of sediment during storage.

J		Akkerman, M.; Johansen, L. B.; Rauh, V.; Sorensen, J.; Larsen, L. B.; Poulsen, N. A.							Relationship between casein micelle size, protein composition and stability of UHT milk.		International Dairy Journal					Casein (CN) micelle size has been suggested as important for stability of ultra-high temperature (UHT) treated milk. Therefore, full fat milk samples were pooled according to native CN micelle size (small, intermediate and large CN micelles), homogenised and UHT treated, and stored at 20 °C or 40 °C for up to 6 months to study storage stability. Small average CN micelle size was associated with higher relative content of kappa-CN B and glycosylated kappa-CN. Processing increased particle size in the skimmed milk, resulting in comparable sizes, regardless of initial size. Major changes in physicochemical properties were observed for all milk pools directly after processing and during storage, greater at elevated storage temperature. Interestingly, milk with small CN micelles before processing displayed significantly less formation of sediment during storage compared with milk with intermediate or large CN micelles, suggesting that inherent variation in milk quality is important for UHT milk stability.

Chicory inulin enhances fermentation of 2′-fucosyllactose by infant fecal microbiota and differentially influences immature dendritic cell and T-cell cytokine responses under normal and Th2-polarizing conditions.		Food & Function					Scope. Non-digestible carbohydrates (NDCs) such as native chicory inulin and 2′-fucosyllactose (2′-FL) are added to infant formula to mimic some of the human milk oligosaccharide (HMO) functions. It is unknown whether combining inulin and 2′-FL influences their fermentation kinetics and whether the immune-modulatory effects of these NDCs are different under normal and inflammatory-prone Th2-polarizing conditions. Methods and results. We investigated the in vitro fermentation of 2′-FL and native chicory inulin, fermented individually and combined, using fecal inocula of 8-week-old infants. Native inulin was fermented in a size-dependent fashion and expedited the fermentation of 2′-FL. Fermentation of both native inulin and 2′FL increased the relative abundance of Bifidobacterium, which coincided with the production of acetate and lactate. The fermentation digesta of all fermentations differentially influenced both dendritic cell and T-cell cytokine responses under normal culture conditions or in presence of the Th2-polarizing cytokines IL-33 and TSLP, with the most pronounced effect for IL-1beta in the presence of TSLP. Conclusions. Our findings show that native inulin can expedite the fermentation of 2′-FL by infant fecal microbiota and that these NDC fermentation digesta have different effects under normal and Th2-polarizing conditions, indicating that infants with different immune backgrounds might benefit from tailored NDC formulations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Akkurt, K.; Mogol, B. A.; Gokmen, V.							Mitigation of acrylamide in baked potato chips by vacuum baking and combined conventional and vacuum baking processes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Consumers tend to reduced-fat products recently due to health concerns, which create a need to design reduced-fat products either changing the recipes or the processes. In the last decade, baking was introduced to reformulated potato chips production to low-fat chips; however it might lead to higher acrylamide formation due to increased processing time. In this study, vacuum baking and combined conventional and vacuum baking processes were introduced as new baking technologies to mitigate acrylamide in baked reformulated potato chips. The acrylamide reduction in vacuum-baked potato chips ranged from 72 to 98% when compared with conventional-baked one (6 min, 200 °C) whose moisture content (4.83%) was similar to all vacuum-(4.07%-4.77%) and combined-baked samples (4.42%-4.57%). The surface browning was significantly different (p < 0.05) during vacuum baking compared to others due to the difference of the heat transfer in the corresponding ovens. Higher L* and lower a* values were observed in vacuum-and combined-baked chips compared to conventional ones. Sensory analysis showed that vacuum-baked samples were more appreciated than the others in texture and overall acceptability (p < 0.05). Vacuum and combined processes might be considered as alternative baking technologies for safer reformulated potato chips. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Aklilu, E. G.							Modeling and optimization of pectin extraction from banana peel using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and response surface methodology (RSM).		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In the present study, the extraction of pectin from banana peel (Musasp.) was optimized using artificial neural network and response surface methodology on the yield and degree of esterification obtained using microwave-assisted extraction methods. The individual, quadratic and interactive effect of process variables (temperature, time, liquid-solid ratio and pH) on the extracted pectin yield and DE of the extract were studied. The results showed that properly trained artificial neural network model was found to be more accurate in prediction as compared to response surface model method. The optimum conditions were found to be temperature of 60 °C, extraction time of 102 min, liquid-solid ratio of 40% (v/w) and pH of 2.7 and within the desirable range of the order of 0.853. The yield of pectin and degree of esterification under these optimum conditions were 14.34% and 63.58, respectively. Temperature, time, liquid-solid ratio and pH revealed a significant (p< 0.05) effect on the pectin yield and degree of esterification. Based on the value of methoxyl content and degree of esterification the extracted pectin was categorized as high methoxyl pectin. Generally, the findings of the study show that banana peel can be explored as a promising alternative for the commercial production of pectin. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Akmal Salim, S.; Rashidah Sukor; Nazri Ismail, M.; Jinap Selamat							Dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and LC-MS/MS analysis for multi-mycotoxin in rice bran: method development, optimization and validation.		Toxins					Rice bran, a by-product of the rice milling process, has emerged as a functional food and being used in formulation of healthy food and drinks. However, rice bran is often contaminated with numerous mycotoxins. In this study, a method to simultaneous detection of aflatoxins (AFB1, AFB2, AFG1, and AFG2), ochratoxin A (OTA), deoxynivalenol (DON), fumonisins (FB1 and FB2), sterigmatocystin (STG), T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS) and zearalenone (ZEA) in rice bran was developed, optimized and validated using dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In DLLME, using a solvent mixture of methanol/water (80:20, v/ v) as the dispersive solvent and chloroform as the extraction solvent with the addition of 5% salt improved the extraction recoveries (63-120%). The developed method was further optimized using the response surface methodology (RSM) combined with Box-Behnken Design (BBD). Under the optimized experimental conditions, good linearity was obtained with a correlation coefficient (r2)≥0.990 and a limit of detection (LOD) between 0.5 to 50 ng g-1. The recoveries ranged from 70.2% to 99.4% with an RSD below 1.28%. The proposed method was successfully applied to analyze multi-mycotoxin in 24 rice bran samples. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Akman, H.; Karaduman, Y.							Evaluating technological quality of cultivated Triticum species, interspecific, and intergeneric hybrids for wheat-based products and breeding programs.		Journal of Cereal Science					Wheat genotypes such as landraces, old cultivars, wheat species, intergeneric and interspecific wheat hybrids from the gene pools nowadays offer an alternative for new wheat products and breeding programs. The present study was carried out to evaluate the grain technological quality parameters in those kinds of wheat species and hybrids under rainfed and irrigated conditions. The results of the study showed that the neglected wheat species, Triticum petropavlovskyi having the highest sedimentation index (SI), swelling index of glutenin (SIG), macro sodium dodecyl sulfate (MSDS), and Zeleny sedimentation (ZSED) values (4.9 and 4.8; 4.7 and 4.4; 77.3 and 71.0 ml; 51.0 and 44.7 ml, respectively) in rainfed and irrigated conditions, and as well as the GlutoPeak aggregation energy (AGGEN), gluten rheological index (GRI), torque before maximum (AM) values under rainfed conditions (1589.2 cm2, 68.1 and 43.0 GPU, respectively) had remarkable high gluten strength. Among the species, Triticum ispahanicum had the highest MSDS, SI, AM, and GRI values in rainfed and irrigated conditions (48.3 and 39.3 ml; 3.0 and 2.6; 37.3 and 25.7 GPU; 56.5 and 37.7, respectively). Aegilotriticum, Triticum sphaerococcum, Triticum dicoccum had also strong gluten quality. Triticum aestivum cv. Kose 220/39 possessed better gluten quality than other old cultivars and a landrace. All those genotypes can be suggested for bread-making. On the other hand, Triticum compactum and Triticum monococcum with their weak gluten strength and soft endosperm texture could be used in soft biscuit wheat breeding programs.

J		Akman, P. K.; Bozkurt, F.; Dogan, K.; Tornuk, F.; Tamturk, F.							Fabrication and characterization of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum loaded sodium alginate edible films.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, sodium alginate (SA) based probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum carrier edible films were fabricated and characterized for survival of probiotics, physicochemical, mechanical, barrier, molecular and thermal properties. Probiotic bacteria adapted well to the polymer matrix, which was indicated by the high survival rate during film drying and the storage for 60 days. Probiotic population remained at higher levels in the case of cold storage. Free or encapsulated bacteria incorporation significantly (P<0.05) increased tensile strength values while no significant (P>0.05) difference between elongation at break levels was observed. Water vapor permeability values significantly increased by the addition of encapsulated probiotics, probably due to the hydrophilic character of the wall material (maltodextrin). DSC thermograms showed that water evaporation peaks were at 121-130 °C while no glassy transition or melting behavior was observed at the SA based films. In conclusion, the results indicated that SA was confirmed as a potent carrier of Lactobacillus plantarum and SA based probiotic films could be conveniently used as edible coating of foods. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Akman, P. K.; Ozulku, G.; Tornuk, F.; Yetim, H.							Potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria isolated from fermented gilaburu and shalgam beverages.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Recently, there has been a growing interest for fermented food and drinks in the world for their possible health benefits. In this study, some lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from two different traditionally fermented Turkish beverages, gilaburu and shalgam and characterized in terms of their probiotic properties. According to obtained results, all the isolates had high resistance to low pH (2.5). Lactiplantibacillus pentosus strain XL963 was the most resistant bacteria to the acidity with a reducing rate of 1.05%. Meanwhile, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum strain W2 was the most resistant isolate to bile salts while Limosilactobacillus fermentum strain Akhavan E3 was the most sensitive one with a reducing ratio of 7.33% at amount of 1.5% bile salts. All the isolates were able to deconjugate the bile salts at varying levels. The antimicrobial effect of the isolates on the test pathogens was also variable. Moreover, bacterial cells showed highly adhesive ability on the Caco-2 adenocarcinoma intestinal epithelial cells from ratio of 37%-88%. In conclusion, in this study, findings indicated that LAB strains isolated from traditional gilaburu and shalgam beverages exhibited high probiotic potential and could be used for designing different functional food products with great bioactive properties.

Impact of blanching, freezing, and fermentation on physicochemical, microbial, and sensory quality of sugar kelp (Saccharina latissima).		Foods					Low seaweed consumption in the West is due to lack of availability and consumer familiarity. In this study, the effects of preservation processes on quality aspects of Saccharina latissima products were assessed. First, a blanching (100 °C for 1 or 3 min) treatment was used to produce seaweed salad. In a second study, effects of blanching, freezing, and fermentation on kelp quality were assessed and processed kelp was used to produce sauerkraut. Blanching significantly decreased (p≤0.05) the instrumental kelp a* value and firmness. The a* value negatively correlated with overall liking of salads. To prepare sauerkraut, raw, raw/frozen (-20 °C), blanched (100 °C, 1 min), or blanched/frozen kelp were mixed with cabbage, salted, inoculated with starter cultures and fermented. Inconsistent trends in L* values, firmness, and fungi enumeration were observed after fermentation. Consumers evaluated kelp salad (n=100) and sauerkraut (n=80) for acceptability. Blanched kelp salad had higher hedonic scores than raw kelp salad. A 100% cabbage sauerkraut control and blanched kelp/cabbage blends were compared; kelp blends were similar to control for appearance, color, and texture but were lower for overall acceptability. Results suggest improved quality and enhanced consumer acceptability of seaweed products with use of minimal processing. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Akomolafe, S. F.; Olasehinde, T. A.; Aluko, B. T.							Diets supplemented with raw and roasted pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo. L) seeds improved some biochemical parameters associated with erectile function in rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study investigated the effect of diet supplemented with raw and roasted pumpkin seeds on some key biochemical parameters relevant to erectile function in corpus cavernosal tissues of male rats. Rats were fed with basal diets (NC), diet supplemented with raw (5% and 10%) and roasted (5% and 10%) pumpkin seeds for the evaluation of adenosine deaminase (ADA), phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5), arginase, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities, including nitric oxide level and malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Diet supplemented with roasted pumpkin seeds showed better PDE-5, ADA, arginase activities, as well as NO and MDA levels. No significant difference was observed in AChE activities of rats treated with raw and roasted pumpkin seeds. The modulatory effects of raw and roasted pumpkin seeds on enzymes associated with erectile dysfunction suggest the biochemical rationale for its therapeutic role in enhancing erectile function. However, roasted pumpkin seeds (10%, w/w of diet) possess more beneficial effects than the raw seeds. Practical Applications. Pumpkin is a nutritious vegetable used in folklore for the treatment of bladder, prostate, and kidney diseases. The seeds are known to contain phenolic compounds which exert different health benefits. Processing of foods has been shown to either improve the quality or reduce the bioactive components which affect its functionality. In this study, roasting improved the biochemical parameters associated with erectile function in male rats. Roasted pumpkin seeds also reduced the oxidative stress parameters in rats' penile tissues when compared to raw pumpkin seeds. This study revealed that thermal processing associated with roasting could improve the antioxidant activity of pumpkin seeds and crucial enzymes related to erectile function. Hence, consumption of roasted pumpkin seeds could be more beneficial compared to raw pumpkin seeds. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Anchovy powder enrichment in brown rice-based instant cereal: a process optimization study using Response Surface Methodology (RSM).		Food Science & Nutrition					There is a need for expanding the utilization of small fish as they constitute an undervalued and important source of protein and micronutrients in many developing countries suffering from micronutrient deficiencies. One way to increase consumption and health benefits is to add nutrient-rich fish meal into staple food ingredients. In this study, Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the processing of an instant rice-based cereal enriched with anchovy powder. The Box-Behnken design was used to study the effect of principal processing variables (drying temperature, drum rotation speed, and slurry solids concentration) on product water activity, color, bulk density, and water solubility index. Viscosity, consistency, and cohesiveness of the reconstitute cereal were also evaluated. Empirical models were developed to describe the relationship between independent and dependent variables and showed regression coefficients (R2) ranging between 71% and 98%. Higher drying temperatures resulted in reduced water activity, darker product color, and lower consistency. While drum speed influenced (p< 0.05) product color and water-binding capacity, bulk density, and consistency of the reconstituted product was associated with slurry solids concentration. Optimal processing conditions obtained from the study were temperature of 130 °C, drum speed of 9.3 rpm, and solids concentration of 20.5%. These conditions would be useful in the production of brown rice-based instant cereal enriched with anchovy powder with desired quality properties. © 2021 The Authors.

Some potential beneficial properties of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains originating from raw milk and kefir grains.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, some potential beneficial properties and probiotic characteristics of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei and Leuconostoc mesenteroides strains were investigated in 48 isolates, which were isolated from raw cow's and sheep's milk and kefir grains. The study aimed to determine the antimicrobial properties, antibiotic resistance profiles, antioxidant properties, proteolytic activities, bile salt resistance levels, and bile salt deconjugation activities of L. paracasei and Leu. mesenteroides strains. L. paracasei strains showed a higher antimicrobial activity profile than Leu. mesenteroides strains. L. paracasei strains were not sensitive to novobiocin (5 g) and bacitracin (10 g), while Leu. mesenteroides ZT8 showed resistance only to polymyxin B (300 g). L. paracasei strains showed higher antioxidant activity compared to Leu. mesenteroides strains. L. paracasei SMM1 strain showed strong growth in the presence of 0.25% bile salt, whereasLeu. mesenteroides ZT8 and Leu. mesenteroides ZX3 showed poor growth. Neither L. paracasei nor Leu. mesenteroidesstrains were able to develop at 0.5%-1% bile salt concentration. Bile salt deconjugation ability was lower in Leu. mesenteroides strains, and Leu. mesenteroides ZT8 produced deconjugation from taurodeoxycholic acid. It was remarkable that Leu. mesenteroides strains showed higher proteolytic activity. Leu. mesenteroides ZT8 strain showed the highest hydrophobicity. Evaluating the obtained results, it was seen that the characteristics of Leu. mesenteroides and L. paracasei strains differed according to the source and strain from which they were isolated. It was determined that both types were suitable for industrial use.

J		Aksakal, F. I.; Koc, K.; Geyikoglu, F.; Karakaya, S.							Ameliorative effect of umbelliferone in remote organ injury induced by renal ischemia-reperfusion in rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					We evaluated the ameliorative role of umbelliferone in kidney, heart, and lung damage induced by renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury in rats. Umbelliferone was given orally to rats 60 min before ischemia. Ischemia was induced for 50 min and then reperfusion for 3 hr. The antioxidant enzymes, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and cytokine levels in the kidney, heart, and lung were measured by ELISA. Moreover, histopathological changes were monitored. Renal I/R-induced oxidative stress in the organs by decreasing antioxidant enzymes. However, umbelliferone pretreatment enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione (GSH), levels, reduced MDA and MPO levels. Renal I/R increased in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, and histopathological changes but these effects were inhibited with umbelliferone pretreatment. Furthermore, umbelliferone increased in nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) level under ischemia conditions. Our results indicated that pretreatment of umbelliferone-ameliorated damages in remote organ induced by renal I/R through suppressing oxidative stress and modulating inflammatory responses. Practical applications. Kidney, heart, and lung damages induced by renal I/R in rats was alleviated by umbelliferone. The oral treatment of umbelliferone markedly reversed the oxidative stress, inflammation, and histopathological changes by increasing in the levels of SOD, GSH, and eNOS, decreasing in the levels of MDA, MPO, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 in distant organ injury induced by renal I/R. This study firstly revealed that umbelliferone has potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity in the remote organ damages caused by renal I/R. Consequently, umbelliferone may be an alternative therapeutic agent for treating renal I/R-induced damages. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13628					FSTA:2021-06-Aj9460
J		Aksay, O.; Selli, S.; Kelebek, H.							LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS-based assessment of the bioactive compounds in fresh and fermented caper (Capparis spinosa) buds and berries.		Food Chemistry					The main objective of this study was to compare bioactive compounds and other important quality parameters of fresh and fermented caper buds and berries. Fresh samples were fermented using dry-salted and brined techniques. The higher phenolic content was determined in the fresh (1843.71 mg/100 g DW) and fermented buds (1198.54-1539.49 mg/100 g DW) rather than the berries (29.72-40.75 mg/100 g DW). Quercetin-3-O-rutinoside, kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside, and quercetin-O-galloly-O-hexoside were the principal phenolic components in fresh and fermented buds while quercetin-3-O-rutinoside in fresh and fermented berries. The amounts of isorhamnetin, quercetin, and kaempferol increased in fermented buds and berries compared to fresh samples. Similarly, antioxidant capacity of buds was found to be markedly higher than berries. As for sugar compounds, it was found that fructose in buds (1.56-3.23 g/100 g DW) and glucose in berries (1.96-6.38 g/100 g DW) had the highest amount. When total phenolics and antioxidant properties were evaluated, it was observed that they were better preserved in the dry-salted samples than the brined samples.

A surveillance of food borne disease outbreaks in India: 2009-2018.		Food Control					Knowledge about distribution of food-borne outbreaks and implicated food-vehicles helps in mitigating the risk of food-borne diseases and is critical for designing strategies to control them. In this study data from Integrated Disease Surveillance Program (IDSP) and Open Government Data Platform India (OGDPI) on food-borne outbreaks for the period 2008-2018 was consolidated and analysed. The modelling methods of Gaussian distribution model (GAM) and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) were used to probe influence of climatic factors (temperature and rainfall) on food-borne outbreaks. Data analysis showed that states of West Bengal (31.22), Karnataka (29.11) and Gujarat (22.67) reported maximum average outbreaks and contributed to 31.5% illnesses and 8.7% deaths. Amongst 19.6% of outbreaks, grains and beans were found to be food-vehicle causing maximum outbreaks (32.7%), while chemically contaminated food caused maximal deaths (70%). Weak correlations of climatic factors with outbreaks resulted in poor performance of ARIMA models. GAM model was validated and predicted 356 outbreaks for the year 2020, late-April to mid-July being most prevalent months. The analysis also revealed inclination of current surveillance program towards chemically contaminated food that resulted in maximal deaths (70%), while biological agents were observed to be under-reported. Despite the limitations, available data shows that food-borne disease outbreaks remain a public health concern in India. Therefore, it is imperative for India to strengthen its disease surveillance program by undertaking capacity-building initiatives at state/local health-care levels and connecting causative agents of outbreaks. This would help in efficient implementation of risk assessment and risk management strategies.

Assessing the fatty acid, carotenoid, and tocopherol compositions of seeds from apple cultivars (Malus domestica Borkh.) grown in Norway.		Foods					Apple production generates large amounts of apple pomace including seeds, leading to high transportation costs, public health hazards and undesirable odor. A new reuse strategy of this kind of waste could solve environmental issues and/or create unconventional sources of health beneficial products. In total, seeds from 75 apple cultivars grown in Norway (both domestic and international) have been analyzed for the first time for oil content and fatty acid profile together with tocopherols and carotenoids quantification in defatted seeds. Seeds from cultivar Hakonseple had the highest oil content (22.10%), with linoleic, oleic acid, and palmitic acid as the most abundant fatty acids. The levels of beta-carotene and lycopene carotenoids and alpha-tocopherol were the highest in defatted seeds of the cultivar Sureple Gron. Principal component analysis separated cultivars according to the total oil content. The Norwegian apple cultivars Hakonseple, Kviteple, Tolleivseple, Vinterrosenstrips, and Tokheimseple are recommended for obtaining vegetable oil due to their high oil contents, while cultivar Sureple Gron can be separated due to its high levels of beta-carotene, lycopene and total tocopherols. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Aksoy, M.; Oztekin, A.							Using of group-based selected flavonoids as alternative inhibitors for potato polyphenol oxidase.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					One of the main problems encountered after fresh-cutting of foods is enzymatic browning causing changes in the texture, taste, and color. The variety of physical and chemical-based antibrowning methods was applied to extend the shelf life of these products. Accordingly, methods using natural compounds are of great importance for health. In this study, it was aimed to prevent enzymatic browning in potato (Solanum tuberosum L. cv. Marfona) by limiting the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity with selected flavonoids. First of all, we purified the potato PPO (pPPO) by single-step affinity chromatography. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and native PAGE were applied on pPPO. Then, the inhibition effects of 7-hydroxyflavone, 7-hydroxy-4′-nitroisoflavone, myricetin, luteolin, 7-methoxyflavone, 6-fluoroflavone, diosmetin, rutin, and diosmin on purified PPO enzyme were investigated. Kinetic assays indicated that myricetin was a remarkable inhibitor with the Ki value of 5 M on pPPO. Practical applications. Potatoes are one of the important diet in many countries. In the processing of potatoes, enzymatic oxidation catalyzed by polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) is lead to losing its taste, flavor, and color. In this current paper, group-based selected flavonoids were proposed as alternative inhibitors of potato PPO enzyme. These flavonoids allowing to limit the PPO activity are commercially available, and they can be potential candidates to be used as antibrowning agents during potato processing. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aksu, E. H.; Kandemir, F. M.; Kucukler, S.							Ameliorative effect of hesperidin on streptozotocin-diabetes mellitus-induced testicular DNA damage and sperm quality degradation in Sprague-Dawley rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study aimed to investigate the effect of hesperidin on reproductive damage caused by diabetes mellitus. A total of 24 adult male rats were divided into four groups: control group, hesperidin group, diabetes mellitus group, and diabetes mellitus + hesperidin group. The study was conducted for 4 weeks. At the end of the study, the rats were sacrificed and testicular oxidative stress markers (MDA, GSH, GSH-Px, SOD, and CAT), DNA damage in testes (8-OHdG), and routine sperm parameters were evaluated. According to the results of the study, most of the parameters were similar in the control and hesperidin groups but CAT activity in the hesperidin group was statistically higher than the control group. Also, diabetes mellitus (DM) significantly increased MDA levels and decreased enzymatic antioxidant (GSH-Px, SOD, CAT) activities and nonenzymatic (GSH) antioxidant levels. On the other hand, hesperidin supplementation significantly decreased oxidative stress and increased enzymatic antioxidant activities and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels due to the antioxidant effect. Also, DM increased DNA damage levels in testicular tissue and hesperidin supplementation significantly decreased DNA damage levels in testes of diabetic male rats. Besides, sperm motility significantly decreased while abnormal sperm rate and dead sperm rate were significantly increased in diabetic rats. Hesperidin supplementation significantly reduced these side effects in diabetic rats. In conclusion, hesperidin supplementation could be beneficial for decreasing the side effects on the male reproductive system caused by DM in rats. Practical applications: Diabetes is an important metabolic disease, affecting quality of life and fertility. Hesperidin has an antioxidant effect and has a potential protective effect on reproductive toxicity in diabetic male rats. Hesperidin decreased oxidative stress, and DNA damage in testis resulted from hyperglycemia and improved sperm quality in diabetic rats. The hesperidin supplementation could be a good strategy to protect male fertility in diabetic patients. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aksu, M. A.; Turan, E.; Sat, I. G.; Erdemir, E.							Red raspberry (Rubus ideaus L.) extracts: a novel ingredient in cemen paste.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Red raspberry (Rubus ideaus L.) has promising potential for the concept of "clean-label food" as a natural coloring and flavoring agent as well as its bioactive properties. The objective of this study was to determine some properties of lyophilized red raspberry water extract (LRWE) and its optimal levels contributing to the improvement of pastirma cemen paste (CP) quality. LRWE displayed high total phenolic and anthocyanin content, and strong antioxidant activity. Incorporating LRWE into CP improved the instrumental redness and sensory color scores between 10.52%-38.79% and 9.62%-71.55%, respectively, depending on the extract level. Compared to the control, the pH, lightness (L*), and yellowness (b*) values of CP decreased with the addition of LRWE, while the redness (a*), titratable acidity, anthocyanin content, and metal chelating activity (MCA) increased. According to these results, 3%, 4%, and 5% LRWE levels can be recommended to enhance the color, sensory acceptability, and functional properties of CP. Novelty impact statement: although the formation and maintenance of the desired color in pastirma cemen paste is an important problem, studies to overcome this problem are quite limited. Natural plant extracts have been widely used in the food industry in recent years as colorant, antioxidant, and antimicrobial due to consumer health concerns. The results of this study showed that the anthocyanin-rich LRWE can be utilized as a natural alternative to synthetic and insect-based colorants in CP production. In this way, better quality and reliable pastirma production will be possible using clean-label natural colorants instead of synthetic dyes. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aktag, I. G.; Gokmen, V.							Investigations on the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in apple juice, orange juice and peach puree under industrial processing conditions.		European Food Research and Technology					The formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural during industrial processing of apple juice, orange juice, and peach puree samples was investigated in this study. Changes in the concentrations of sugars, free amino acids, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in the samples from the critical process stages such as pasteurization, enzyme treatment, concentration, were monitored. The concentrations of sugars and free amino acids showed no statistically significant change during processing. 3-deoxyglucosone was identified as the dominant dicarbonyl compound formed during orange juice and peach puree processes, while glucosone was the main one formed in apple juice samples at all sampling points. In general, total dicarbonyl compounds significantly increased (p< 0.05) in apple juice, orange juice, and peach puree samples during processing, varied between 2.04 and 28.09 mg/L, 9.16 and 31.2 mg/L, and 8.9 and 48.31 mg/kg, respectively. The concentration of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was found to be low in apple and orange samples and not detected in peach puree samples. The presence of molecular oxygen, the temperature and the duration of the process were determined as the remarkable processing parameters that affect the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aktag, I. G.; Gokmen, V.							Investigations on the formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in fruit products during storage: new insights into the role of Maillard reaction.		Food Chemistry					The formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was investigated under different conditions and the amino acid adducts of them were confirmed using high-resolution mass spectrometry in fruit products during storage. Changes in the concentrations of sugars, amino acids, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural in fruit juice concentrates and dried fruits were monitored. Among the dicarbonyls, glucosone was the dominant one in 30 °Bx of fruit juice concentrates, whereas 3-deoxyglucosone was the major in 50 and 70 °Bx of those and in all dried fruits during storage. The highest level of 3-deoxyglucosone was found as 7251 896.6 mg/kg in dried date at the end of the storage. During storage, the loss of free amino acids significantly increased (p < 0.05) in the higher initial reactant concentrations in fruit juice concentrates. The confirmation of amino acid adducts of dicarbonyls and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural generally with high mass accuracy proved the contribution of Maillard reaction to non-enzymatic reactions in fruit products.

J		Aktas, A. B.; Ozen, B.; Alamprese, C.							Effects of processing parameters on chemical and physical properties of enzymatically interesterified beef tallow-corn oil blends.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The purpose of this study was to improve some physical and chemical characteristics of tallow through enzymatic interesterification process with corn oil and to investigate effects of process parameters on chemical and physical properties of obtained products. Full factorial design was constructed using blend ratio and reaction time as process parameters. Enzymatic interesterification was catalyzed with sn-1,3-specific lipase. Interesterified lipids have higher free fatty acid content and lower oxidative stability compared to initial blends. Interesterification did not cause trans-fatty acid formation and products mostly contained beta crystals. Solid fat content and slip melting point decreased up to 6 hr of interesterification; however, longer reaction times have negative effects on these parameters. Statistical analyses' results confirmed that reaction time is highly important for enzymatic interesterification. Practical applications. Some of interesterified lipids can be utilized as alternatives to margarines or butterfat due to their lower trans-fatty acid content and crystal morphology. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aktas, R. N.; Tontul, I.							Usability of soapwort and horse chestnut saponin extracts as foaming agents in foam mat drying of pomegranate juice.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This study evaluated the usability of saponin-rich extracts (soapwort and horse chestnut) as a foaming agent for foam mat drying of pomegranate juice. Results. According to the foaming and stabilization studies, the optimum conditions were determined as 0.4% of soapwort extract, 0.03% of carboxymethyl cellulose as a stabilizer, and 3 min of whipping time. The foams produced using these conditions were dried at different spreading thicknesses and drying temperatures. The results showed that the thicker spreading thicknesses provided a higher antioxidant activity. On the other hand, drying temperature had a significant effect on all measured parameters except moisture content and water activity. The higher drying temperature caused a greater colour change and a lower content of total phenolics, total monomeric anthocyanins, cyanidin-3-glucoside, and delphinidin-3-glucoside. On the other hand, a higher content of ascorbic acid and better antioxidant activity was determined in the samples dried at 70 °C. Conclusion. According to the results obtained, spreading thickness of 2mm and drying temperature of 70 °C were suggested for pomegranate juice powder production by foam mat drying. Overall, it was demonstrated that saponin-rich extracts are a good foaming agent alternative that provides foaming at very low concentrations and a product with high quality. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Aktas-Akyildiz, E.; Koksel, H.							Minimisation of vitamin losses in fortified cookies by response surface methodology and validation of the determination methods.		European Food Research and Technology					Food fortification is one of the global strategies to decrease micronutrient deficiency in the society. Flour, cereal products including cookies, are significant vehicles for food fortification. In this study, flour was fortified with thiamine, riboflavin and niacin at a level to meet 25-35% of recommended dietary allowance for each vitamin. Cookies were produced using the fortified flour with some variation in baking temperatures (190, 205, and 220 °C) and baking times (9, 12, and 15 min). Effects of baking temperatures and baking times on quality characteristics, colour values, and vitamin contents of fortified cookies were investigated. The processing conditions were optimised by response surface methodology (RSM) to minimise the vitamin losses in cookies. The vitamin losses in the cookies produced at different baking temperatures and baking times were in the range of 1.8-50.0%, 1.6-24.4% and 0.6-11.9% for thiamine, riboflavin and niacin, respectively. Validation studies were also carried out and the results indicated that the equipment and the method were suitable for vitamin B analyses in cookies. Overall, the optimum conditions for minimum vitamin losses were determined as 190 °C baking temperature and 15-min baking time according to RSM. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Biochemical components, enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities in endemic plant Scilla mesopotamica speta.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, in vitro antioxidant, antimicrobial, anticholinesterase and phenolic profile of different solvent extracts of Scilla mesopotamica speta were determined in detail. In vitro antioxidant activities and total phenolic and flavonoid contents of plant extracts obtained with different solvents were tested in terms of 2.2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activities. The highest total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were determined in the ethyl acetate extract (62.24 g GAE/mg) and chloroform extract (87.72 g QE/mg) respectively. The highest DPPH radical scavenging activity was detected in ethyl acetate extracts. Antimicrobial and antifungal activities were investigated by MIC method. The inhibitory activities of the extracts on the acetyl cholinesterase enzyme were investigated. Liquid chromatography (LC) tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS was used to determine the phenolic component content of extracts. Thirty-one different components were identified in the analyses and their amounts were measured. Practical applications. Scilla mesopotamica speta is an endemic and medicinal plant. It was determined that the extracts of this plant had a very rich content in terms of phenolic compounds, especially caffeic and ferulic acids. However, this plant was remarkable for its antioxidant, anticholinesterase, and antimicrobial activities. Considering the strong antioxidant, antimicrobial, and enzyme inhibition activities of the Scilla mesopotamica speta it can be suggested as a source of anticancer, antimicrobial, and antiviral drugs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to isolate, identify, and conduct a growth study of potential probiotics from pineapple peel (PP), watermelon peel (WP), and banana peel (BP). Six strains were isolated, and the growth study was conducted at 30 °C at 150 rpm after 24 hr incubation. Based on colony characteristics, cell morphology, and gene sequencing, the isolates were identified as yeast strains, namely, Meyerozyma caribbica (PP) and Candida orthopsilosis (WP and BP). M. caribbica showed the highest biomass production of 2.34 g/L. Less biomass production of 2.01 and 2.18 g/L was obtained for C. orthopsilosis (WP and BP), respectively. The maximum specific growth rate in the exponential phase was 1.83 and 1.23 h-1 for C. orthopsilosis (WP and BP), followed by 1.04 hr-1 for M. caribbica, respectively. M. caribbica isolated from PP belongs to the group of potential yeast probiotics which is a good candidate for further studies to determine its probiotic properties. Novelty impact statement. Waste utilization for an economical and alternative natural source of probiotic production. The probiotic potential in yeasts has not been extensively studied before. In this study, Meyerozyma caribbica was identified from pineapple peels as a new yeast probiotic starter. M. caribbica exhibited the highest biomass production and maximum growth rate, so these essential parameters in determining the quantitative importance should be considered. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16035					FSTA:2022-04-Jb4671
J		Akter Mou, S.; Rafiza Islam; Mohammad Shoeb; Nilufar Nahar							Determination of chloramphenicol in meat samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.		Food Science & Nutrition					Chloramphenicol (CAP), a bacteriostatic antibiotic, is used for the treatment of bacterial infections in human and animals. Continual exposure of CAP residues into animal tissues may lead to antibiotic resistance. For the protection of humans and animals from this problem, a fast and highly sensitive analytical method based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) was developed and validated in this study for the quantitative determination of CAP in poultry meat and beef samples. Quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was used for the extraction of CAP residues. The developed method was validated in terms of linearity, accuracy, precision, and specificity. Poultry meat and beef samples were extracted with 20 ml water-acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) and cleaned up by MgSO4, primary secondary amine, and C18 powder. The method was found to be linear in a wide concentration range, with correlation coefficient of higher than 0.999. The repeatability and reproducibility of this method were satisfactory. The achieved limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.16 and 0.50 ng/g, respectively. Recoveries were estimated at 5 and 10 ng/g spiking levels in the range of 99%-111% with the coefficient of variation 0.48%-12.48% for spiked samples, and the matrix enhancement effects were mild in the range of 80%-85%. In this study, the levels of CAP residue in tested real samples were found below the detection limit. The method proved to be suitable for CAP determination in all kinds of samples tested and also efficient for the application of routine analysis. © 2021 The Authors.

Determination of ellagic acid, punicalagin, and castalagin from Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu plum) by a validated UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS methodology.		Food Analytical Methods					Punicalagin, a bioactive ellagitannin predominantly found in Pomegranate, has a wide range of health benefits including potent antioxidant properties. The metabolism of punicalagin in human body produces urolithins and ellagic acid. Ellagic acid is a natural phenolic antioxidant and is also known for its antiproliferative activities. Terminalia ferdinandiana (Kakadu plum) was reported to be a rich source of ellagic acid. In this study, an UHPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for accurate determination of ellagic acid levels and bioactive ellagitannins (punicalagin and castalagin). Total ellagic acid content in the fruits and leaves were 2.76 and 9.54 g/100 g DW. Punicalagin contents in the fruits and leaves were 74 and 49mg/100 g DW, and castalagin contents were 1.1 and 0.8mg/100 g DW. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report about punicalagin and castalagin concentrations in Kakadu plum fruits and leaves. The findings are very promising regarding the potential use of Kakadu plum fruit and leaf extracts as natural preservatives in the food industry. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Akyildiz, A.; Mertoglu, T. S.; Agcam, E.							Kinetic study for ascorbic acid degradation, hydroxymethylfurfural and furfural formations in Orange juice.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, changes in ascorbic acid-(AA), hydroxymethylfurfural-(HMF) and furfural content of orange juice (OJ) were investigated during processing with different thermal treatments and storage conditions. According to the AA degradation kinetics; the half-lifes of thermally processed OJ at 70, 75, 80,85 and 90 °C ranged between 666.5-1136.3 s. D-values for the same temperatures were calculated as 3774.7, 3337.1, 2914.7, 2646.6 and 2214s, respectively. z, Ea and Q10-values of AA were also calculated as 86.32 °C, 26.87 kJ mol-1, and 1.31; respectively. HMF formation kinetics showed that the doubling time of thermally processed OJ (70-90 °C) were determined between 42.0 and 77.0 s. D-values at those temperatures ranged from 139.6-255.8 s. z, Ea and Q10-values of HMF were also calculated as 75.98 °C, 31.34 kJ mol-1, and 1.35, respectively. For furfural formation kinetics, doubling time of thermally processed OJ at 70-90 °C was determined between 52.1-74.5 s. The D-values of furfural were calculated between 173.1-274.1 s at the same temperatures. z, Ea and Q10-values of furfural were also calculated as 100.21 °C, 24.98 kJ mol-1, and 1.26, respectively. The most obvious changes were determined during storage at 25 °C for the investigated compounds when compared to 4 °C. OJ samples processed at moderate temperatures performed better AA retention, and lower HMF and furfural formation was determined for those samples during shelf-life.

J		Akyuz, A.; Ersus, S.							Optimization of enzyme assisted extraction of protein from the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) leaves for alternative plant protein concentrate production.		Food Chemistry					This research focused on the effect of temperature (25-75 °C), extraction time (40-120 min) and solvent/solid ratio (15-45 mL/g) and the enzyme assisted extraction on protein extraction efficiency from by-product of sugar beet. 3 different methods were applied in protein isolation and the highest protein yield (34.55%) was obtained by the isoelectric-ammonium sulfate precipitation method. At the optimized condition of temperature 54.25 °C, 81.35 min, and solvent/solid ratio of 27.65 mL/g, the protein yield was found 55.15%. The protein yield has reached 79.01% with an increase of 43.27% with the aid of the enzyme assisted extraction. The physicochemical properties were determined for revealing its potential use in food industry. It is promising that the isolated protein concentrates (SPC-IAP) show high protein content (69.08% d.

J		Akyuz, A.; Ersus, S.							Optimization of enzyme assisted extraction of protein from the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) leaves for alternative plant protein concentrate production.		International Sugar Journal					This research focused on the effect of temperature (25-75 °C), extraction time (40-120 min) and solvent/solid ratio (15-45 mL/g) and the enzyme assisted extraction on protein extraction efficiency from by-product of sugar beet. 3 different methods were applied in protein isolation and the highest protein yield (34.55%) was obtained by the isoelectric-ammonium sulfate precipitation method. At the optimized condition of temperature 54.25 C, 81.35 min, and solvent/solid ratio of 27.65 mL/g, the protein yield was found 55.15%. The protein yield has reached 79.01% with an increase of 43.27% with the aid of the enzyme assisted extraction. The physicochemical properties were determined for revealing its potential use in food industry. It is promising that the isolated protein concentrates (SPC-IAP) show high protein content (69.08% d. B) as well as high solubility (98.71% at pH 7.5). SPC-IAP's high brightness (L= 79.55), low redness (a*=0.33) and low yellowness (b*=13.27) values are encouraging for food industry.										2021	123	1466			0020-8841				10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127673					FSTA:2021-07-Lc1196

Alsawmahi							Effect of cold press and Soxhlet extraction systems on total carotenoid, antioxidant activity values and phytochemicals in caper (Capparis ovata var herbacea) seed oils.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Total carotenoid and chlorophyll amounts of caper seed oils extracted in cold press and Soxhlet extraction methods were determined as 18.21 (cold press) and 17.33 (Soxhlet) to 31.68 (cold press) and 30.06 mg/g (Soxhlet), respectively. The caper seed oils contained 54.125 (cold press) and 86.63 mg/100 g (Soxhlet) total flavonoid. Total carotenoid and chlorophyll contents of seed oils extracted by cold press were found high. In addition, total phenolic, total flavonoid, and antioxidant activity values of seed oils extracted by Soxhlet were detected as higher. Gallic acid amounts of caper seed oils were determined as 3.70 (cold press) and 5.48 mg/100 ml (Soxhlet). 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene amounts of seed oil samples were identified as 5.15 (cold press) and 8.28 mg/100 ml (Soxhlet). The oleic and linoleic acid amounts of oils extracted by the cold press and Soxhlet were detected as 11.67% and 12.08% to 54.25% and 54.22%, respectively. Practical applications. Caper plant grows in many countries of Africa, Asia and South European. It is a source of natural components in the food industry. Cold pressing procedure involves no heat or chemical treatments. Cold press technique is simple and environment-friendly method. Solvent extraction on the other hand is a cost-effective and fast method of oil extraction. The current study provides comparison of these two methods to extract natural phytochemicals in caper seed oil. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Al Jumayi, H. A.; Darwish, A. M. G.							Frying time and temperature conditions' influences on physicochemical, texture, and sensorial quality parameters of barley-soybean chips.		Journal of Food Quality					Demand for innovative healthy snacks that achieve consumer satisfaction represents increased interest for competitive food producers. The aim of this work was the assessment of physicochemical and sensory quality of barley-soybean chips involving legume protein flours by studying the effects of different substitution levels (10, 20, and 30%) of defatted soybean (DSB) flour, frying temperatures (150, 170, and 190°C), and frying times (60, 90, and 120sec). The chips' moisture content was significantly decreased with increased frying temperature and time. The moisture content (1.40%) was achieved at 10% DSB fried at 190°C for 120sec. The least absorbed oil (29.25%) was achieved at the least substitution percentage (10% DSB), the least frying temperature (150°C), and the least frying time (60sec). These results were reflected on sensorial parameters that revealed that the most preferred chips were barley-soybean chips with 10% DSB fried at 150 and 170°C. The amylose content was increased by 33.80% in chips substituted with 30% DSB, while it was decreased to 27.16% in chips substituted with 10% DSB, and vice versa for the amylopectin content. TPA revealed that DSB substitution levels were directly proportional with hardness and inversely proportional with elasticity and adhesiveness. From obtained results, substitution levels with 10% DSB fried at 150°C are recommended. These findings encourage the production of innovative enhanced snacks involving legume protein while maintaining consumer satisfaction. Copyright © 2021 Huda Abdalrahman AL Jumayi and Amira M. G.

J		Al Riza, D. F.; Kondo, N.; Rotich, V. K.; Perone, C.; Giametta, F.							Cultivar and geographical origin authentication of Italian extra virgin olive oil using front-face fluorescence spectroscopy and chemometrics.		Food Control					A front-face fluorescence method has been used to obtain an excitation-emission matrix (EEM) of various Italian mono-cultivar, and mix-cultivar, extra virgin olive oils without any laborious sample preparation. These EEM use excitations from 230 to 360 nm and emissions from 260 to 390 nm to explore potential fingerprint characteristics that could be used for cultivar and geographical origin authentication. To simplify these complex spectral datasets, the variable reduction was undertaken using total absolute principal component coefficients. It has been found that at least 3 excitation wavelengths are necessary to obtain 5 variables which could explain more than 95% of the sample variance with 4 principal components. The 5 selected wavelength pairs (Ex./Em. 300/315; 300/340; 280/300; 280/320; and 265/330 nm) are recommended as a sensitive fingerprint of the EVOOs. Of the subsequent models explored based on this fingerprint, a non-parametric fine k-NN classifier was found to best classify the cultivar and geographical origins of the EVOOs. This result demonstrates that multiple excitation fluorescence techniques can be used for authentication of EVOO cultivars and geographical origins. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Eid; Kameswaran Ravichandran; Prasanna Rajagopalan							Cassia auriculata leaf extract ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by attenuating autophagic necroptosis via RIP-1/RIP-3-p-p38MAPK signaling.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the most common manifestation of high glucose induced diabetes mellitus. In this study, we report the effects of Cassia auriculata ethanol leaf extract (CALE) on DN-associated cell toxicity and complications. The effects of CALE were screened in vitro using RGE cells. Cell viability was assessed using MTT and flow cytometry. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into control, DN and treatment groups (n=8). The DN and treatment groups received 60 mg/kg/bw of streptozotocin in citrate buffer, while the treatment group was administered 150 mg/kg/bw of CALE for 10 weeks. Biochemical analysis was conducted using spectrophotometry. Kidney tissues were analyzed using hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy. CD365-KIM-1 expression was assessed using flow cytometry and signalling proteins were detected using western blotting. Treatment with 30-mM glucose reduced the viability of RGE cells in a time-dependent manner and increased the population of dead RGE cells. Cotreatment with CALE reduced cell death and glucose induced protein expression of LC3-II, RIP-1 and RIP-3 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, CALE improved the biochemical complications, renal dysfunction and pathophysiology of rats with DN and partially or fully restored the expression of key DN-associated signalling proteins, such as KIM-1 LC3-II, RIP-1, RIP-3 and p-p38MAPK in kidney cells. CALE showed protective effects, and improved DN-associated complications in RGE cells under high glucose stress conditions, potentially by inhibiting autophagic-necroptosis signals. Additionally, CALE improved the biochemical and pathological features of kidney injury while reducing autophagic-necroptosis in rat renal cells via the LC3-II-RIP-p38MAPK pathway. Practical applications results from the current investigation will add information to the literature on glucose induced renal toxicity and the protective effects of CALE over the complications of diabetic nephropathy (DN). The mechanistic investigations of the study will add light on the autophagic/necroptosis signals in DN and open new routes of investigations to study the efficacy of CALE in diabetes-related complications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		, Dr. Mohammad Abo Hassan/GRJ-3535-2022	, Dr. Mohammad Abo Hassan/0000-0002-3882-975X; Alshahrani, Mohammad/0000-0002-7096-0221; RAVICHANDRAN, KAMESWARAN/0000-0002-0596-2044; Eid, Refaat/0000-0001-5633-9562; Rajagopalan, Prasanna/0000-0001-7593-7234							2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13810					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14629
J		Al Shoffe, Y.; Nock, J. F.; Yiyi Zhang; Watkins, C. B.							Physiological disorder development of "Honeycrisp" apples after pre-and post-harvest 1-methycyclopropene (1-MCP) treatments.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Susceptibility of apple fruit to physiological storage disorders is affected by both pre-and postharvest factors that influence their ethylene production. In this study, the inhibitor of ethylene perception, 1-methycyclopropene (1-MCP), applied before and after harvest, has been used to investigate the interactions between ethylene and development of physiological disorders in "Honeycrisp" apples during storage. Preharvest 1-MCP (Harvista) was applied to trees, either 2 weeks (early), 1 week (late), at 1 and 2 weeks (repeated), or at double rate 1 week, before first commercial harvest. Fruit were then untreated or treated with postharvest 1-MCP (SmartFresh) and stored at 0.5 °C, or conditioned at 10 °C for 7 d and then stored at 3 °C (C + 3 °C), for 20 weeks. Fruit quality and physiological disorders were assessed after 4 d at 20 °C. Fruit from all preharvest 1-MCP treatments had lower internal ethylene concentrations (IECs) and were greener as indicated by higher IAD values compared with untreated controls, while effects on starch pattern indices (SPI) were inconsistent. After storage, preharvest 1-MCP-treated fruit were firmer than untreated fruit, but effects of the different application timings were inconsistent. Effects of postharvest 1-MCP on IEC and IAD values were greater at 0.5 °C than at C + 3 °C. High incidences of core browning and vascular browning developed during storage, especially in the preharvest 1-MCP-treated fruit. Soft scald was reduced by preharvest 1-MCP treatments compared with control. In the C + 3 °C storage treatment, preharvest 1-MCP-treated fruit had a higher bitter pit incidence than in control fruit, but less skin wrinkling and senescent breakdown. Postharvest 1-MCP treatment of preharvest 1-MCP fruit slightly decreased bitter pit incidence while greatly increasing that of core browning and leather blotch, and sometimes flesh browning and carbon dioxide injury. This study shows that pre- and postharvest inhibition of ethylene perception by 1-MCP can have marked effects on storage disorders that are affected by fruit maturity and storage temperatures.

J		Al Suhaibani, A.; Ben Bacha, A.; Mona Alonazi; Shafi Bhat, R.; Afaf El-Ansary							Testing the combined effects of probiotics and prebiotics against neurotoxic effects of propionic acid orally administered to rat pups.		Food Science & Nutrition					The present study investigated the combined effects of mixed probiotic and bee pollen on brain intoxication induced by propionic acid (PPA) in rat pups. Thirty western albino rats were divided into five groups, six animals each: (1) Control group receiving phosphate-buffered saline; (2) Probiotic and bee pollen-treated group being administered at the same dose with 200 mg/kg body weight; (c) PPA-treated group receiving a neurotoxic dose 250 mg/kg body weight of PPA for 3 days; (d) Therapeutic group being administered the neurotoxic dose of PPA followed by probiotic and bee pollen treatment 200 mg/kg body weight; (e) Protective group receiving probiotic and bee pollen mixture treatment followed by neurotoxic dose of PPA. Selected biochemical parameters linked to oxidative stress, energy metabolism, and neurotransmission were investigated in brain homogenates from all the five groups. PPA treatment showed an increase in oxidative stress markers like lipid peroxidation coupled with a significant decrease in glutathione level. Impaired energy metabolism was ascertained via the alteration of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activities. Dramatic increase of Na+ and K+ concentrations together with a decrease of GABA and IL-6 and an elevation of glutamate levels in PPA-treated rat's pups confirmed the neurotoxicity effect of PPA. Interestingly, the mixed probiotic and bee pollen treatment were effective in restoring the levels of glutamate, GABA, and IL-6 in addition to normalizing the levels of lipid peroxidation and glutathione and the activities of CK and LDH. The present study indicates that mixed probiotic and bee pollen treatment can improve poor detoxification, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation as mechanisms implicated in the etiology of autism. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Al-Adilah, H.; Al-Sharrah, T. K.; Al-Bader, D.; Ebel, R.; Kupper, F. C.; Puja Kumari							Assessment of Arabian gulf seaweeds from Kuwait as sources of nutritionally important polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs).		Foods					The fatty acid (FA) compositions of ten seaweeds representative of Chlorophyta, Rhodophyta, and Ochrophyta from Kuwait in the Arabian Gulf region were determined and are discussed in the context of their potential nutritional perspectives for seaweed valorization. All the seaweeds had higher saturated fatty acid (SFA) and lower monounsaturated (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) contents than those typical of tropical environments. Palmitic, myristic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic, and stearidonic acids were the major FAs detected. Arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids were detected in minor amounts. Conserved fatty acid patterns revealed phylogenetic relationships among phyla, classes, and orders matching the molecular phylogenies at higher taxonomic ranks. Hierarchical clustering analyses clearly segregated different seaweeds (except Codium papillatum and Iyengaria stellata) into distinct groups based on their FA signatures. All but one species (Chondria sp.) had health-beneficial n6/n3 PUFAs (0.33:1-2.94:1) and atherogenic (0.80-2.52) and thrombogenic indices (0.61-5.17). However, low PUFA/SFA contents in most of the species (except Ulva spp.) may limit their utilization in the formulation of PUFA-rich functional foods. Ulva spp. Had substantially high PUFAs with PUFA/SFA > 0.4, n6/n3 (0.33-0.66) and atherogenic (0.80-1.15) and thrombogenic indices (0.49-0.72), providing substantial potential for their utilization in food and feed applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Rashed							Fabrication, characterization, and anti-free radical performance of edible packaging-chitosan film synthesized from shrimp shell incorporated with ginger essential oil.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study was aimed to investigate the properties of macromolecule chitosan composite film extracted from shrimp shells combined with ginger essential oil (GEO). Shrimp shells were employed to produce chitin. Their properties were measured as an effective food coating. The tensile strength decreased significantly with increased GEO concentrations compared to the control sample 31.12, 32.34, and 35.12 Map for both control and GEO concentrations of 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3%, respectively. Furthermore, the percentage of elongation increases with concentrations of GEO from 18.10 to 19.87% for each film 0.1 and 0.3%, respectively. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that GEO reduced the weight of chitosan-based film incorporating GEO loss at high levels of temperature. Composite films were characterized by their high ability scavenging hydroxyl and superoxide radicals. The findings of the current study showed that chitosan-based film incorporating GEO is a promising source for preparing bioactive films and that its use as anti-free radicals can be highly effective in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Bioscience					Germination is a non-chemical and simple approach usually used to improve the bio-availability of crucial nutrients. In this study, the effect of germination on molecular, physicochemical, morphological properties of highland barley starch was investigated. The results of this study revealed that germination for 72 h (GB72) significantly increased amylose content and gelatinization temperatures (To and Tc) to 26.3%, 59.79°C, and 68.19°C as compared to 22.81%, 57.56°C, and 67.05°C in native barley starch (NB), respectively, and a significant decrease in total starch contents was noticed (31.67%) in GB72 as compared to 45.70% in NB. After germination, the FT-IR intensity ratio of 995/1022 and 1047/1022 bands, pasting temperatures, particle size, and swelling capacity were also decreased. Moreover, average molecular-weight, relative crystallinity, gelatinization temperature ranges, and enthalpy of gelatinization were decreased as compared to NB starch, and the decrease was more obvious in GB72 starches (0.49*108 g/mol, 17.64%, 8.40°C, and 6.41J/g), respectively. This study indicates the effectiveness of germination for the modification of highland barley starch and its potential to enhance starch-based products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammation of the colonic mucosa. Gum Arabic (GA) has been reported to exert anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic activity. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of GA on disease activity in an experimental model of colitis. Dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) was used to induce colitis in C57BL/6 mice and the animals were then switched to normal drinking water to monitor recovery. Mice received 140 g/L GA before (pre-GA group) or after (post-GA group) induction of colitis. Disease activity and recovery were assessed by changes in body weight, disease activity index (DAI), and histological assessment. Gene expression of proinflammatory, anti-inflammatory, and fibrotic markers was measured in colonic tissues. Mice in the pre-GA group showed an increase in body weight, with no differences in DAI scores, during the recovery phase and had lower histological colitis scores than mice in the post-GA group, which showed higher DAI and histological scores during the recovery phase. During the recovery phase, mice in the pre-GA group showed increased expression of proinflammatory markers, while gene expression of the fibrotic markers, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGFbeta1) and procollagen I, was reduced. The reduced fibrotic marker expression was associated with reduced collagen staining and increased epithelial cell proliferation. Administration of GA had protective and alleviative effects on the severity of DSS-induced colitis, with a reduction in colonic fibrosis and TGFbeta1 expression. These data warrant further in vitro and in vivo investigations on the effect of GA on fibroblast activity.										2021	24	12	1255	1263	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.0007					FSTA:2023-01-Ge0339
J		Al-Dairi, M.; Pankaj B. Pathare; Al-Yahyai, R.							Quality changes kinetic of tomato during transportation and storage.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Kinetic models were performed to investigate the quality changes of tomatoes. The samples were transported from three different distances (100, 154, and 205km), and then stored at a temperature of 10 and 22 °C. Physical (weight loss, color, and firmness), chemical (titratable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSSs), sugar/acid ratio, and pH), and nutritional (total lycopene and carotenoids) quality parameters of tomato were measured for 12days of storage. Transportation of tomatoes from the long-distance transportation and storage at 22 °C resulted in a higher increase in weight loss, redness, color index, total lycopene, and carotenoids, and a higher decrease in firmness, color lightness, TA, and so forth. The results showed that the quality changes were well described by the zero-order kinetic model (with a coefficient of determination R2 = values of. 9993-.8400). Weight loss, total lycopene, and carotenoids were adequately fitted with the zero-order kinetic model, where TSSs and most firmness experimental values were successfully fitted with the first-order kinetic model. In all cases, the reaction rate constant (k) was higher at 22 °C storage temperature compared to storage at 10 °C. To validate the appropriateness of the selected models, weight loss, firmness, some color parameters, TA, and total lycopene were taken as examples. All the experimental and predicted data showed a strong agreement. Overall, the results of this study could help the distributors, processors, and consumers to identify the storage time and the ideal edible time. Practical applications: The practical application obtainable from our research is the classification of fresh produce based on their maturity stage is required to select the suitable packaging with high strength material during long-distance transportation. Also, the practical objective of the study is to improve refrigeration storage condition of tomato or many other fresh produce after transportation in the industrial field to maintain its quality attributes for long time. In particular, the proposed study establishes the correlation between transport distance, storage temperature, and duration and the quality attributes of tomato to obtain a mathematical model to predict the quality changes during storage and to assess the effect of transport distance on tomato. The knowledge of such type of data can help to develop an advanced supply chain strategies like transporting, storage, and routing policies. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Al-Degs, Y. S.; El-Sheikh, A. H.; Abdullah I. Saleh; Al-Reyahi, A. Y.							Interval wavelength selection and simultaneous quantification of spectrally overlapping food colorants by multivariate calibration.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Variables selection is often necessary to remove redundant data and to reduce the negative influence of spectral overlapping. In the current work, two interval variable selection methods were applied to quantify five coloring agents (Tartrazine TAR, Sunset Yellow SY, Allura Red AR, Brilliant Blue BBL, and Brilliant Black BBK) which exhibited intense spectral overlapping in powdered soft drinks. Interval partial least squares iPLS and net analyte signal NAS methodology were used to pick up the most informative variables for dyes quantification in powdered soft drinks. Based on NAS calculations, the optimum sensitivity and selectivity for dyes measurement were found to be (1.23-5.56) and (0.30-0.72), respectively and at pH 3.0. Moreover, the minimum spectral overlapping (28-70%) among dyes was observed at pH 3.0 while the maximum overlapping (38-74%) was at pH 10.0. Interval partial least squares iPLS was more capable to handle the overlapping between SY and AR dyes. On the other hand, net analyte signal method was effective to capturing the informative regions for dyes of lower spectral overlapping, TAR, BBL, and BBK. In the case of AR, the best prediction (REP% 2.4) was achieved at 350-530 nm using iPLS. However, the best prediction of BBL (REP% 3.4%) was achieved at 655-680 nm (i.e., 6 variables) using NAS/PLS regression. The ability NAS/PLS regression, which uses fewer number of variables, was attributed to NAS mechanism which extracts the net signal of the analyte, thus; preventing overlapping with the rest of compounds signals and this will elegantly leads to fewer number of variables. The superiority of iPLS to calibrate intensely overlapping dyes is attributed to its inherent mechanism of selecting the spectral data that include all possible variables leading to better prediction. At the optimum calibration conditions, the dyes were detected in powdered soft drinks with adequate accuracy (%recoveries 97.3-107.5) and precision (RSD 3.1-9.30). The maximum total concentration of dyes was reported in orange drink samples reaching to 567mg/kg. The result highlights and emphasizes the highly required further monitoring of this type of food, considering the damages of such popular synthetic dyes to human health. Analysis of results by ANOVA indicated that the total content of dyes was statistically comparable in the samples while the total content of each single dye was statistically different in tested samples. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

Pomegranate peel attenuates dextran sulfate sodium-induced lipid peroxidation in rat small intestine by enhancing the glutathione/glutathione disulfide redox potential.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The peel of the pomegranate fruit is rich in polyphenols with antioxidant properties. We investigated the preventive effect of pomegranate peel (PP) powder against dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced lipid peroxidation in the small intestine of rats. Rats were allocated to four groups: CONT group, fed a standard rodent diet; DSS group, fed a standard rodent diet and treated with DSS; as well as PP1%+DSS and PP5%+DSS groups, fed a standard rodent diet supplemented with either 1% or 5% of PP powder and treated with DSS. Rats of the four groups consumed their diets for 25days. Lipid peroxidation was determined by measuring malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations in plasma and MDA contents in the small intestine and liver. Glutathione/glutathione disulfide (GSH/GSSG) redox status and antioxidant enzyme activities were determined in the small intestine and liver. Results. MDA content was higher (P< 0.001) in the small intestines of the DSS group compared to the CONT group. MDA content was reduced (P< 0.001) in the small intestines of the PP1%+DSS and PP5%+DSS groups compared to the DSS group. GSH contents and GSH/GSSG ratios were higher (P< 0.001) in the small intestines of the PP5%+DSS group compared to the CONT, DSS and PP1%+DSS groups. Conclusion. The present study demonstrates that PP powder protects the small intestine against DSS-induced lipid peroxidation by enhancing the GSH/GSSG redox potential. Powder of PP is a promising agricultural by-product containing a mixture of bioactive polyphenols that can be used for the production of functional foods aimed at the prevention of oxidative stress-induced small intestine pathogenesis. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	10	4278	4287	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11067					FSTA:2021-10-Jg13307

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, gelatin from camel bones (Camelus dromedarius) at three different ages (2.5, 4.5 and 7 years old) was extracted using heating and chemical pretreatment methods. The extraction process was conducted by using hydrochloric acid (0.5 M) (at room temperature 25°C for 72 h) to demineralize the bones and partially hydrolyze the collagen followed by neutralizing with 4% ammonium sulphate. Extraction of camel bone gelatin (CBG) was carried out with distilled water (1:3, w/v) at 75°C for 3 h, followed by extraction temperature at 90°C for 1 h resulting in a yield of dry bases ranging from 21.3 to 23.9%. Camel bone gelatin had high protein content (89.31-93.3%), optimum moisture (6.0%), and low ash content (3.62%). The rheological properties, ATR-FTIR and bloom gel, were also investigated. The gel strength (GS) of the camel bone gelatin ranged from 107 to 192 g. The gelatin produced showed good quality and did not differ from other commercial gelatins. The produced gelatin could be useful for food and pharmaceutical implementation. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

K.; Pei-Hsuan Lee; Mousavi Khaneghah, A.; Mohsen Gavahian							Pilot-scale hydraulic-pressure extraction of Sukari date honey (Phoenix dactylifera L.) to enhance resource efficiency: effects of processing parameters on bioactive compounds and physicochemical quality.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The present study explored the hydraulic pressure process as an alternative process to the conventional extraction of date honey. In this regard, response surface methodology (RSM) and central composite design (CCD) were utilized as process optimization tools to achieve the highest yield and efficiency. Independent processing parameters were temperature (50-60 °C) and pressure (4-12bar). Moreover, the effect of optimum conditions on the quality and active compounds of date honey were studied. The results showed that the optimum conditions to give the highest yield (45.83%) and extraction efficiency (87.99%) were a temperature of 60 °C and a pressure of 8.83bar with a come-up time of 6 hr. The pH values of extracted date honey were higher than the conventional method. The change in pH values was described using the first-order kinetic equation. While moisture content and acidity were significantly lower than the conventional method, hydraulic pressure increased the ash, protein, total sugar, reduced sugar, pectin, and total soluble solids. The valorization approach developed in this study provides a platform for producing high-quality date honey as a value-added product from an underutilized date. The findings can help with enhancing resource efficiency through agricultural waste valorization. Practical Applications. Hydraulic press extracted the date honey at a pilot scale and showed good potential for further upscaling. This method addressed a significant concern of conventional extraction, that is, quality deterioration. In addition, the hydraulic press enhanced the extraction yield and process efficiency. Furthermore, results elaborated on the effects of processing parameters. Such approaches can be used in the industry to enhance resource efficiency and to help with achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Refractance window (RW) concentration of milk-Part II: computer vision approach for optimizing microbial and sensory qualities.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study is the second part of ongoing research on developing a refractive window (RW) milk concentrator. The response surface methodology-computer vision approach provided a platform to maximize process productivity, minimize energy consumption, and optimize microbiological, sensory, and color parameters. The results were compared with the conventional concentration (CC). Experimental conditions were temperatures at 50, 60, and 70 °C and pressures of 0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 bar. According to the results, the RW product had a better sensory and microbiological characteristic than CC. The optimum process conditions in terms of shelf-life and sensory properties were the pressure of 0.45 bar and temperature of 66 °C. The productivity of RW was higher than that of CC by 110% (2.3 vs. 1.1 L/h). Besides, RW products got a higher score on sensory assessment in comparison with CC. Furthermore, RW significantly increased the shelf-life and decreased the peroxide value of concentrated milk. Results suggested that RW has the potential to be implemented in dairy industry in the future. Novelty impact statement. The response surface methodology-computer vision approach was found to be a useful platform for process optimization based on sensory and microbiological qualities; The pressure and temperature of 0.45 bar and 66 °C were optimal process conditions; refractive window improved the productivity, sensory scores, and reduced the peroxide value in comparison with the conventional method. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Evaluation of the anticancer activity and fatty acids composition of "Handal" (Citrullus colocynthis L.) seed oil, a desert plant from south Jordan.		Food Science & Nutrition					Background. The chemical composition of Handal (Citrullus colocynthis L.) seed oil cultivated in Jordan deserts was characterized, and its bioactivity was evaluated. Methods. The oil was extracted from the grinded seeds in 500 ml Soxhlet extractor for 24 hr using n-hexane, and the recovered fatty acids were methylated with methanolic-HCL. The fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) composition was analyzed using GC-MS and GC-FID. The anticancer activity associated with the oil was assessed against colon cancer cell lines (Caco-2 and HCT-116) and compared to its cytotoxicity on the human skin fibroblast. Multivariate analysis was used to determine relationship of the fatty acid composition with that of the anticancer activity. Results. The results demonstrated that fatty acid composition of Citrullus colocynthis seed oil chiefly contains Linoleic acid, denoted as C18:2n6 (75%), followed by Palmitic acid C16:0 (8%), Stearic acid C18:0 (5%), and Oleic acid C18:1n9 (9%). It is demonstrated as an excellent source of essential fatty acids omega-6 (e.g., Linoleic acid), whereas omega-3 (e.g., alpha-Linolenic acid) and hydroxy polyunsaturated fatty acids are found at small level. Interestingly, the oil exhibited reasonable anticancer effects against colorectal cancer cell lines with IC50 values varying between 4 and 7 mg/ml. The correlation test revealed a relationship between the fatty acid composition and the effectiveness on treatments. Conclusions. Handal plant from Jordan appears to have very high level of Linoleic acid compared to other oils measured in different geographic locations and that there appears to be some anticancer activities associated with the fatty acid content of Handal seed oil. © 2020 The Authors.

Analysis of multiple mycotoxins in the Qatari population and their relation to markers of oxidative stress.		Toxins					Mycotoxins are naturally occurring food toxins worldwide that can cause serious health effects. The measurement of mycotoxin biomarkers in biological fluids is needed to assess individuals' exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of mycotoxins in the Qatari population. Serum samples from 412 adults and urinary samples from 559 adults were analyzed for the presence of mycotoxin biomarkers. Multimycotoxin approaches have been applied, using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods. Samples were further analyzed for the oxidative stress markers and compared with regard to the incidence of mycotoxins. The presence of mycotoxins was identified in 37% of serum samples and in less than 20% of urine samples. It was found that 88% of positive of the samples were positive for only one mycotoxin, while 12% of positive samples had two or more mycotoxins. Trichothecenes and zearalenone metabolites were most commonly detected mycotoxins, followed by aflatoxins, roquefortine C and mycophenolic acid. The presence of mycotoxins was found to positively correlate with oxidative stress markers. The obtained results illustrate the importance of mycotoxin biomonitoring studies in humans and the need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of mycotoxin-induced toxicity. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Al-Mahmood, O.; Bridges, W. C.; Xiuping Jiang; Fraser, A. M.							A longitudinal study: microbiological evaluation of two halal beef slaughterhouses in the United States.		Food Control					Most evidence about the hygienic condition of halal food is derived from studies conducted in Muslim-majority countries, not western countries. Because context of practice is different in Muslim-majority countries, it is difficult to apply these findings to western countries, such as the United States. We aimed to determine the hygienic condition of beef carcasses and environmental surfaces in two U.S. Halal beef slaughterhouses over a 12-month period. Each month between November 2016 and October 2017 samples were collected [N=432 carcass samples (pre-and post-evisceration)] and 59 surface samples (slaughter hall floor, brisket saw, and offal table). All carcass and surface samples were analyzed for detectable levels of four indicator organisms--aerobic plate count (APC), Enterobacteriaceae count (EC), total coliform count (TCC), and generic Escherichia coli (ECC). All indicator organisms (APC, ECC, TCC, and EC) in samples collected from both plants were within acceptable limits based on USDA microbiological guidelines of beef carcasses. Significant differences (P< 0.001) in the detectable levels of indicator organisms between pre-and post-evisceration were shown in plant B but not plant A. A significant difference (P< 0.01) in detectable levels of all indicator organisms was shown between winter and summer. Levels were higher during the summer (June-September) in pre-evisceration samples at both plants compared to samples collected in the winter (December-February). These findings can be used to inform food safety interventions targeting halal beef slaughter operations in the United States. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Nada							Edible packaging coating of encapsulated thyme essential oil in liposomal chitosan emulsions to improve the shelf life of Karish cheese.		Food Bioscience					Edible packaging materials of encapsulated essential oils in biopolymers have been investigated to provide an effective and safe approach for food preservation. In this study, chitosan-based emulsions made of liposomes loaded with thyme essential oil (TEO) were investigated to extend the shelf-life of Karish cheese. Liposomal chitosan emulsions were prepared via reverse-phase evaporation method and its macrostructure was demonstrated. Chitosan-based emulsions with TEO/liposomes, prepared by 2% wt/v chitosan solutions, are stable over 2 months. GC/MS analysis of TEO showed that thymol and p-cymene are the major compounds with 30 and 13.7% respectively. Antimicrobial activities were assessed via visible microbial growth method and total bacteria counts of mesophilic, phsychrotrophic bacteria, yeast and mould over 4 weeks. Visible microbial growth test showed an explicit microbial growth, by the second week, for all cheese samples that are not coated or coated with chitosan solutions. Cheese samples coated with chitosan containing TEO 1 and 2% v/v stayed safe with accepted microbial counts till the end of third week. However, samples coated with liposomal chitosan emulsions encapsulated TEO 1and 2% v/v remained in acceptable appearance and microbial counts up to 4 weeks. Coatings showed neutral effects on moisture content, pH and titratable acidity. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	43				2212-4292				10.1016/j.fbio.2021.101230					FSTA:2022-01-Pj0141

Journal of Food Quality					Foodborne diseases are usually caused by consuming foods that are stored at an inappropriate temperature. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge of safe food temperature control among restaurant supervisors of Dammam city, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was carried out during January 2019 to May 2019. A close-ended questionnaire was used to assess knowledge and source of information about food temperature control from restaurant supervisors. The response rate of the study was 97 (80.8%). Demographic profile and knowledge scores of restaurant supervisors are reported as percentage. Chi-square test was used to compare group differences in knowledge. P value <0.05 was considered significant. Restaurant supervisors had good knowledge about safe temperature for cold food (93.8%) and storing food in the freezer (83.5%) and in the refrigerator (79.4%), while they had poor knowledge of safe temperature for hot food (14.4%) and the range of temperature in which bacteria grow rapidly (danger zone temperature) in food (15.5%). All restaurant supervisors reported food and environmental inspector as their main source of information about food temperature control. Restaurant supervisors' education level and place of work showed a significant association with safe temperature for storing food in the refrigerator and the best method to check safe cooking temperature. The high percentage of lack in the knowledge of safe temperature control for hot foods and danger zone temperature among restaurant supervisors is of great concern for public health as it exposes the customers to foodborne illnesses. The study results emphasize on the necessity to conduct education and training programs for restaurant supervisors to improve the quality of food served to consumers and protect them from foodborne illnesses and food poisoning.

Antagonistic effects of Lactobacillus reuteri against Escherichia coli O157:H7 in white-brined cheese under different storage conditions.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study aimed to investigate the survival of the foodborne pathogen Escherichia coli O157:H7 in white-brined cheeses as influenced by the presence of Lactobacillus reuteri. The white cheeses were made from pasteurized bovine milk inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 (cocktail of 3 strains) to achieve ~5 log10 cfu/g with absence or presence of Lb. reuteri (~6 log10 cfu/g). Cheese samples were brined in 10% or 15% NaCl solution and stored at 10 °C and 25 °C for 28 d. The white-brined cheeses were assessed for salt content, pH, water activity (Aw), and numbers of E. coli O157:H7, Lb. reuteri, nonstarter lactic acid bacteria (NSLAB), yeasts, and molds. Results showed that E. coli O157:H7 survived in cheese stored in both brine solutions at 10 °C and 25 °C regardless of the presence of Lb. reuteri. A substantial reduction was observed in cheese stored in 10% NaCl brine at 25 °C, followed by cheese stored in 15% NaCl brine at 10 °C by 2.64 and 2.16 log10 cfu/g, respectively, in the presence of Lb. reuteri and by 1.02 and 1.87 log10 cfu/g, respectively, in the absence of Lb. reuteri under the same conditions. The pathogen in brine solutions survived but at a lower rate. Furthermore, the growth of Lb. reuteri and NSLAB were enhanced or slightly decreased in cheese and brine by 28 d, respectively. The salt concentrations of cheese ranged from 4 to 6% and 5 to 7% (wt/wt), during 28-d ripening in 10 and 15% brine, respectively. Values of pH and Aw slightly increased at d 1 after exposure to brine and reached 4.69 to 6.08 and 0.91 to 0.95, respectively, in all treatments. Therefore, the addition of Lb. reuteri can be used as a biopreservation method to inhibit the survival of E. coli O157:H7 in white-brined cheese when combined with the appropriate temperature, NaCl level, and storage time.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Reversed-phase switchable-hydrophilicity solvent liquid-liquid microextraction (RP-SHS-LLME) was used prior to smartphone digital image colorimetry (SDIC) for the determination of copper as its metal chelate with N, N-diethyl-N'-benzoylthiourea (DEBT). Images of the extract were captured inside a colorimetric box, which were split into their red-green-blue channels and the intensity of the blue channel was linearly correlated to the concentration of copper. The optimum SDIC conditions were achieved at a wavelength of 400nm, a distance of 7.0cm between the sample holder and the detection camera, a region of interest of 2500 px2 and light source brightness of 30.0%. Optimum RP-SHS-LLME performance was realized with 80.0muL of triethylamine as a switchable-hydrophilicity solvent, 140.0muL of 7.5mol L-1 nitric acid as a hydrophilicity-switching trigger, at a complexation pH of 5.5, 200muL of DEBT and 200muL of 1-dodecanol as the complexation solvent within 4.0min. The limit of detection (LOD) was found as 0.3mug mL-1 with coefficients of determination of the calibration graphs higher than 0.9963 and relative standard deviations lower than 6.9%. The proposed method was applied for the determination of copper in edible oil samples (i.e., black seed, corn, olive and sunflower oil), with percentage relative recoveries obtained in the range of 92.5-105.0%.

Effect of different plants' aromatic essential oils on frozen Awassi lamb meat's chemical and physical characteristics.		Italian Journal of Food Science					The effect of drenching Awassi lambs with three aromatic essential oils from sage (Salvia officinalis L.), clove (Syzygium aromaticum L.), and laurel (Laurus nobilis L.) was investigated on meat chemical and physical characteristics, and oxidative and deterioration measurements. Twenty-four Awassi lambs, five to six months old, were divided into four groups. A concentrated diet was provided to the lambs at a rate of 3% of the body weight. The treatments were as follows: T1 was served as the untreated control, while T2, T3, and T4 were drenched with oils of sage, clove, and laurel, respectively. Drenching was carried out using water-soluble capsules containing 500mg oil/capsule/day. Treatments lasted 90 days. At the end of the treatment period, the animals were fasted overnight and slaughtered. The carcasses were cleaned and kept at 4°C for 24 h. The longissimus dorsi (LD) muscle was then separated and preserved in a plastic bag for three preservation periods: no freezing and 30 days and 60 days freezing at -18°C. Several physical, fat, and protein stability analyses of meat were done after the preservation periods. The results indicated no significant effect of drenching Awassi lambs with different aromatic essential oils on the meat's physical and chemical characteristics. However, these oils, especially clove oil, affected fat and protein stability with increasing preservation period by freezing.

Monitoring of selected banned azo dyes in edible oils by high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector.		Food Analytical Methods					A new simple and rapid HPLC method was described and validated for simultaneous determination of eight banned dye compounds in corn and olive oil. These dyes are namely Sudan I, II, III, and IV (SI, SII, SIII, SIV); Sudan Orange G (SOG); Sudan Red G (SRG); Fat Brown B (FBB); and Fat Red 7B (FR7B). The oil samples were dissolved in hexane, followed by liquid-liquid extraction and enrichment with acetonitrile. Then, the samples were cleaned using a PTFE syringe filter and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a photodiode array detector (DAD) for separation, identification, and quantification of these dyes. The chromatographic separations were carried out using an ODS column under an isocratic mode using a mixture of acetonitrile, isopropanol, and water. The method was linear for all targeted compounds over the range of 0.25-50mg/kg. All correlation recoveries were in the range 87-106% with a precision (RSD) less than 7%. Results of the twenty samples (ten corn oil and the ten olive oil samples), collected randomly from Jordanian markets during February 2018, were lower than the detection limits for the eight compounds. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	12	2478	2485	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02050-z					FSTA:2022-07-Ne1512

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Lycium barbarum L. Leaves contain high amounts of mineral rich polysaccharides. In this study, the crude and the degraded polysaccharide using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and vitamin C were prepared and tested as additives to investigate their effects on the quality of wheat dough using rheological assays. Polysaccharides, in particular degraded polysaccharide, significantly promoted the texture properties and extensographic characteristics of wheat dough compared to the control (p < 0.05), indicating an improvement in dough strength. The gluten networks in the dough samples exhibited dramatically dense and tight characteristics. This could be attributed to the formation of disulfide bonds triggered by the crude and degraded polysaccharides. Besides, analysis revealed that polysaccharides conformation played a major role in the transformation of the protein secondary structures from beta-sheets to beta-turns and alpha-helixes. Results. Demonstrated that the chemical degradation of polysaccharide could greatly improve the gluten network of wheat dough.

J		Alaa Baazeem; Rodriguez, A.; Medina, A.; Naresh Magan							Impacts of climate change interacting abiotic factors on growth, aflD and aflR gene expression and aflatoxin B1 production by Aspergillus flavus strains in vitro and on pistachio nuts.		Toxins					Pistachio nuts are an important economic tree nut crop which is used directly or processed for many food-related activities. They can become colonized by mycotoxigenic spoilage fungi, especially Aspergillus flavus, mainly resulting in contamination with aflatoxins (AFs), especially aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). The prevailing climate in which these crops are grown changes as temperature and atmospheric CO2 levels increase, and episodes of extreme wet/dry cycles occur due to human industrial activity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of interacting Climate Change (CC)-related abiotic factors of temperature (35 vs. 37 °C), CO2 (400 vs. 1000 ppm), and water stress (0.98-0.93 water activity, aw) on (a) growth (b) aflD and aflR biosynthetic gene expression and (c) AFB1 production by two strains A. flavus (AB3, AB10) in vitro on milled pistachio-based media and when colonizing layers of shelled raw pistachio nuts. The A. flavus strains were resilient in terms of growth on pistachio-based media and the colonisation of pistachio nuts with no significant difference when exposed to the interacting three-way climate-related abiotic factors. However, in vitro studies showed that AFB1 production was significantly stimulated (p< 0.05), especially when exposed to 1000 ppm CO2 at 0.98-0.95 aw and 35 °C, and sometimes in the 37 °C treatment group at 0.98 aw. The relative expression of the structural aflD gene involved in AFB1 biosynthesis was decreased or only slightly increased, relative to the control conditions at elevated CO, regardless of the aw level examined. For the regulatory aflR gene expression, there was a significant (p< 0.05) increase in 1000 ppm CO2 and 37 °C for both strains, especially at 0.95 aw. The in situ colonization of pistachio nuts resulted in a significant (p< 0.05) stimulation of AFB1 production at 35 °C and 1000 ppm CO2 for both strains, especially at 0.98 aw. At 37 °C, AFB1 production was either decreased, in strain AB3, or remained similar, as in strain AB10, when exposed to 1000 ppm CO2. This suggests that CC factors may have a differential effect, depending on the interacting conditions of temperature, exposure to CO2 and the level of water stress on AFB1 production. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Disk diffusion method to determine antimicrobial activity of plant essential oils was used. While the essential oil extracted from oregano has a high effect on nine of our test microorganisms (75%), one of them had a medium effect and two of them had a weak effect in the test results. While the essential oil obtained from thyme was effective on VRE, MSSA, Escherichia feacalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis, it was not effective on Salmonella enteritidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Candida albicans. The most effective essential oils on microorganisms were oregano, thyme, and lavandula oils. The essential oils were more effective to MSSA, VRE, E. feacalis, and S. epidermidis. In our study, we aimed to shed light on the beneficial use of herbal products for human health. The pandemic process has shown the importance of fight against pathogenic microorganisms. We believe that this study will contribute to conservation medicine. Practical applications. In recent years, plant products such as exytract, essential, oleoresin oil, etc. Have become crucial due to the rapid resistance microorganisms have built to antibiotics. Essential oils have been generally used in cosmetics, medicine, and food industries. Also, the volatile compounds obtained from plants have antimicrobial, antifungal, and insecticidal effects. The antimicrobial activity of essential oil is fundamentally attributed to its main components, but the synergistic or antagonistic effect of a compound in the small percentage of the mixture must be taken into consideration. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Alak, G.; Kaynar, A.; Muhammed Atamanalp							The impact of salt concentrations on the physicochemical and microbiological changes of rainbow trout caviar.		Food Bioscience					Fish and other fishery products are among the foods recommended for the prevention and treatment of diseases with their high nutritional properties. The demand for fish caviar has increased in recent years due to the increase in fish consumption and their high nutritional and commercial value. In order to meet this increasing demand, caviar substitutes obtained from different fish species have been investigated, however in these limited studies, generally, information about products and markets are provided. In this study, caviar obtained from 30 female rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss, raised under farm conditions) were processed with different salt concentrations (2,4 and 8%). Physicochemical [lipid peroxidation (with Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substance (TBARS)), protein degradation (with Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate-PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), color (L*, a*, b*) and salt content of caviar formed by salting process)] and microbiological [total aerobic bacteria (TAB)] quality parameters on certain days of 21-day storage (4 °C) (0., 3., 6., 9., 12., 15., 18., and 21.) was investigated. As a result of the study, the changes in TAB, TBARS, L *, a *, b * values and salinity levels during storage were determined as important (p < 0.05). At the end of storage, it was detected in different profiles as well as phosphoprotein and glycoproteins as major protein groups in the SDS-PAGE analysis. In terms of microbiology, 8% salt concentration was found to be very low compared to control and other salt applications. Considering all the research findings, high salt concentrations were determined to have a positive effect on the preservation of quality.

Evaluation of bioactive chemical composition, phenolic, and antioxidant profiling of different crude extracts of Sargassum coriifolium and Hypnea pannosa seaweeds.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Seaweed as a source of functionally bioactive components has been well recognized due to its beneficial effects for human health. However, beneficial health effects of seaweeds vary with the different aspects especially geographical location of the seaweed. In the present study, two seaweeds (Sargassum coriifolium, Hypnea pannosa) were collected from Bangladesh and crude extracts were prepared using methanol, ethanol and water as extraction solvent. Here, we determined preliminary phytochemical composition, total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC) and antioxidant activity of crude extracts using different qualitative and quantitative in vitro assays. Overall, screening of phytochemicals revealed that both the seaweeds contain diverse type bioactive compounds including terpenoid, saponin, phlobatannin, cardiac glycosides, phenolic and flavonoid depending on the seaweed species and extraction solvents used. FT-IR spectroscopy also confirmed the presence of phenols, carboxylic acid, ketones, ethers, aromatics, amides and sulfonates at varying degree. Methanol extract of S. coriifolium and H. pannosa showed highest activity followed by ethanol and water extracts. Here, methanolic extract of S. coriifolium showed highest amount of TPC (128.56 mg of GA/g), TFC (58.29 mg of quercetin/g), DPPH (75.01%, IC50=1.03 mg/ml), ABTS (72.24%, IC50=1.55 mg/ml), hydrogen peroxide (71.64%, IC50=1.98 mg/ml), phosphomolybdenum (28.08 mg of ASE/g) and reducing power assays (938.5208 mg of ASE/g). A positive correlation was found among TPC and different antioxidant assays. These results confirmed the presence of diverse type of chemical composition with its antioxidant activity which will be useful for pharmacological as well as in functional food application. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1653	1665	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00758-w					FSTA:2021-10-Rg3542

Journal of Food Quality					Choice of the harvest date is one of the foundations of vintage quality and good-yield sugar in sugar beet. However, it is difficult to define the harvest date and more precisely the date of maturity of beet roots, in an exact and absolute way. Indeed, maturity is divided into several stages and degrees depending on environmental and climatic conditions such as temperature, precipitation, geographic area, and others. The present study evoked the effect of three harvest dates (at esteemed maturity, 7 days after maturity, and 15 days after maturity) on the technological quality parameters, namely, sucrose, nitrogen, potassium, and sodium, using the most popular chemometric method, principal component analysis (PCA). To do this, samples from the Tadla irrigated perimeter were used. The results of exploratory analyses by the application of PCA clearly showed the influence of harvest date, in an important way, on the three quality parameters, composition of sucrose, potassium, and sodium. But, for nitrogen composition, there were negligible variations between samples. Copyright © 2021 Lamiae Alami et al.										2021	2021				0146-9428				10.1155/2021/6639612					FSTA:2022-06-Lc0869

Food Research International					The great heterogeneity currently present when characterizing wine consumption kinetics means that a saturation method, as well as different parameters that allow comparison between wines, need to be established. The aim of this work was to establish a robust method for a wine saturation protocol and compare different fitting models to approximate the oxygen consumption kinetics. To differentiate wines, parameters extracted from the oxygen consumption curves were studied and proposed. 72 young commercial wines (red, white and rose) from different Spanish appellations of origin, varieties and vintages were used. The results revealed that 5 min was enough to saturate wines up to the maximum level for each one at 35°C. The inverse curve fitting model showed the best results for all wines. Oxygen at half consumption time (Omid) and time required to consume from 90% to 10% of the oxygen initially available (DeltatO_90_10) were the parameters that differentiated wines the most.

J		Alamprese, C.; Grassi, S.; Tugnolo, A.; Casiraghi, E.							Prediction of olive ripening degree combining image analysis and FT-NIR spectroscopy for virgin olive oil optimisation.		Food Control					This work proposes classification models for the prediction of olive maturity index based on Fourier Transform-Near Infrared (FT-NIR) spectra of intact drupes. An image analysis (IA) method was purposely developed for the objective evaluation of the maturity index. Thirteen cultivars at different ripening stages were harvested along three years. The reliability of the IA method was confirmed by the highly significant correlation with the common visual evaluation of maturity index. Classification models were developed with Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), using IA results and FT-NIR spectra of olives collected in diffuse reflectance. Most PLS-DA models calculated separately for olive origin gave sensitivity and specificity values in prediction higher than 81%. The global model performed slightly worse (sensitivity, 79%; specificity, 75%), but it is definitely more robust and can provide the olive sector with a fast, green and non-destructive olive sorting method for the production of high quality virgin oil.

Foods					This study evaluated the nutritional, antinutritional properties, and consumer preferences of five maize-based snacks at the household level. The physical, nutritional, and antinutritional properties were analyzed with standard laboratory methods, while a structured questionnaire was used for the data collection on consumer preferences of the maize products. There were significant (p< 0.05) differences in the proximate parameters of the maize snack samples. Antinutritional properties among maize snacks all fell within the permissible range. Respondents from all districts showed no significant (p> 0.05) differences in maize chin-chin variants' and maize finger variants' except for Serenje and Mkushi districts where maize chin-chin and maize finger showed significant (p< 0.05) differences in their sensory ratings. However, across districts, the most rated maize finger variant was the spiced 100% maize finger. In conclusion, maize-based snacks enriched with soybean flour have proven nutritious with a reasonable acceptability level. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

HPLC-DAD-Q-ToF-MS profiling of phenolic compounds from mango (Mangifera indica L.) seed kernel of different cultivars and maturation stages as a preliminary approach to determine functional and nutraceutical value.		Food Chemistry					Mango seed kernel is a by-product which is usually discarded. However, it has been confirmed in this study that seed kernel exhibits more phenolic compounds with bioactive properties than edible fraction of mango. The influence of factors such as cultivar and maturation degree on the phenolic composition has been studied to evaluate nutraceutical value. The comprehensive analysis of phenolic composition by HPLC-DAD-Q-ToF-MS seed kernel from different cultivars ("Keitt", "Kent"and "Osteen") at five maturation stages was conducted. Results. Evidenced that "Keitt" samples exhibited higher quantities of iriflophenone glucoside, maclurin C-glucoside, maclurin digalloyl glucoside, mangiferin, 5-galloyl quinic acid and trigalloyl glucose at the first three ripening stages. However, seed kernel from "Osteen" variety showed higher amounts of hexa-and hepta-gallotannins whose concentrations diminished over the maturation course. Therefore, cultivar and maturation stage factors should be take into account due to their influence on the phenolic composition and subsequently on the nutraceutical value.

J		Alanon, M. E.; Pimentel-Moral, S.; Arreez-Roman, D.; Segura-Carretero, A.							Profiling phenolic compounds in underutilized mango peel by-products from cultivars grown in Spanish subtropical climate over maturation course.		Food Research International					Nutraceutical market has undergone an exponential growth worldwide due to its health link-up. With the purpose of evaluating nutraceutical value, the phenolic composition of underutilized mango peel by-products of three cultivars ("Keitt", "Kent" and "Osteen") grown in Spanish subtropical climate was monitored at three maturation stages (green, ripe and overripe). Tracking the total phenol content, mango peels were figured out to have until twenty-seven fold higher than edible fraction. Mango peels comprised a wide range of phenolic compounds such as mono-and di-galloyl compounds, gallotannins, phenolic acids, benzophenones and flavonoids. The influence of both factors, cultivar and maturation degree, on the phenolic composition was the main outcome of the research. "Keitt" mango peel was revealed as the cultivar with the highest phenolic content mainly due to the great quantities of galloyl glucose, 5-galloylquinic acid, digalloylquinic acid, hexagalloyl glucose and macluring galloyl glucoside detected. Regarding to the effect of maturation degree, green mango peels showed the highest amounts of polyphenols, although this behaviour could be dependent on the mango cultivar. Therefore, mango peels resulted to be a promising and low-cost resource of phenolic compounds to be exploited in food industry, but to enhance the nutraceutical value, factors such as cultivar and maturation degree should be taken into account.

Influence on the quality of the final stoppers.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cork companies store cork planks before processing them for a minimum of 6 months to dry up and to stabilize their texture and chemical composition, although many companies extend this storage period up to 12months. However, there is no information about the influence of this seasoning period on their "corky" off flavors. For this reason, the main compounds responsible for the "cork taint" of planks stored before processing from 6 to 12months were investigated. Results. Four haloanisoles and three halophenols were identified: 2,4,6-trichloroanisole (TCA), 2,3, 4,6-tetrachloroanisole (TeCA), pentachloroanisole (PCA), 2,4,6-tribromoanisole (TBA), 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP), 2,3, 4,6-tetrachlorophenol (TeCP), and 2,4,6-tribromophenol (TBP). All of the planks presented some haloanisole or halophenol after 6 and 9 months of storage, which practically disappeared after a year of storage. These compounds were only detected in the cork stoppers made from planks with 6 and 9 months of storage. Of the alkylmethoxypyrazines, 2-methoxy-3,5-dimethylpyrazine (MDMP), 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IPMP), and 3-isobutyl-2-methoxypyrazine (IBMP) were identified. The MDMP was detected in a larger number of planks with 6 months of storage and at higher concentrations than IPMP and IBMP. However, MDMP was not detected in the cork stoppers made from planks at 6,9, and 12months of storage. Conclusion. A storage time of 6 months before processing of raw cork planks would be sufficient to obtain cork stoppers with low concentrations of corky off-flavor compounds. An increase in storage up to 9 or 12months would result in practically "cork taint"-free natural stoppers. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.		; Alanon, M.

Chemical characteristics and colorimetric properties of non-centrifugal cane sugar ("panela") obtained via different processing technologies.		Food Chemistry					Non-centrifugal cane sugar (NCS) samples obtained by traditional moulding and granulation, and also via a novel spray-drying powdering process without additives, were assessed to characterise their sugar and phenolic profiles, flavonoid content, as well as colour parameters. As expected, sucrose was the predominant sugar (91.9-95.5%), followed by glucose (2.9-4.6%), and fructose (1.6-3.7%). Total phenolic content was between 0.4 and 0.6% and total flavonoid content into the range of 0.2-0.4%. Six phenolic acids were found in all NCS samples: protocatechuic acid (0.36-0.94 g/100 g), vanillic acid (0.70-1.45 g/100 g), chlorogenic acid (2.08-3.82 g/100 g), syringic acid (1.08-2.80 g/100 g), p-coumaric acid (0.69-1.35 g/100 g), and ferulic acid (0.50-0.95 g/100 g). The thermal treatment under high temperatures required in the production of granulated products was related with darker colours and changes in phenol and flavonoid contents. In contrast, spray drying generates clearer products, but with slightly less phenol and flavonoid contents. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of winery by-product extracts on oxidative stability, volatile organic compounds and aroma profile of cooked pork model systems during chilled storage.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Grape stem and vine-shoot extracts have been studied in cooked pork model system as alternative preservatives to prevent oxidation reactions. After cooking, samples were stored in refrigeration and analyzed at 0,10 and 20 d. Winery extracts addition (3 g/100 g) preserved better redness loss and reduced lipid and protein oxidation during chilled storage, being more effective than the traditional additive sodium ascorbate. A significant increase of total phenolics content and catechins, and the subsequent greater antioxidant capacity, were observed in samples added with winery extracts, being particularly noticeable in those treated with vine-shoot extract. Furthermore, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) concentration derived from lipid oxidation during chilled storage were lessen inhibited thanks to the extracts addition. Nonanal, some unsaturated aldehydes and octanoic acid showed high odor activity values (OAVs) in control samples after storage, evoking rancid odors. In this sense, winery by-products samples did not exhibit these flavors whereas distinguished pleasant sensorial features described as "herbaceous" or "woody" were found.

Inactive dry yeast to improve the oxidative stability of Spanish dry-fermented sausage "salchichon".		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The use of inactive dry yeasts (IDY) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a natural alternative to sodium ascorbate to inhibit the oxidation reactions of Spanish dry-fermented sausage "salchichon" was studied. Control sausages and those treated with different IDY concentrations were monitored and analyzed at 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28 d throughout the ripening process. The application of IDY (1.5 and 3 g/100 g) did not affect the physicochemical parameters and microbial counts over time. However, IDY addition achieved a more stable phenolic content, antioxidant activity of samples was increased, and a lower lipid and protein oxidation were observed compared to the use of sodium ascorbate. Likewise, sausages with 3 g/100 g IDY showed similar or lower quantities of volatile compounds related to lipid oxidation at the end of ripening than those elaborated with sodium ascorbate. From a sensory point of view, IDY addition provided bread/yeast and sweet notes to sausages. However, consumers did not find differences among samples in a hedonic ranking test. Therefore, IDY could be employed in "salchichon" as natural preservatives providing pleasant sensory attributes to the product. All rights reserved, Elsevier.		; Alanon, M.

J		Alasalvar, G. K.; Keklik, N. M.							Modeling of Listeria monocytogenes survival and quality attributes of sliced mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) subjected to pulsed UV light.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Pulsed ultraviolet (PUV) light technology holds the potential for surface decontamination of foods. In this study, the survival of L. monocytogenes and some quality attributes (color, moisture, water activity, and antioxidant activity) of sliced mushrooms subjected to PUV light were modeled using data obtained from a previous study. Three mathematical models, log-linear model, Weibull model, and log-logistic model were used to describe the inactivation of L. monocytogenes with respect to fluence (J/cm2) at three treatment distances (5,8, and 13cm) from the quartz window of the PUV-light system. Weibull model (R2adj: 0.8598-0.9820, root mean square error [RMSE]: 0.09-0.24) described the inactivation better compared to log-linear model (R2adj: 0.7205-0.9072, RMSE: 0.22) and log-logistic model (R2adj: 0.4871-0.7629, RMSE: 0.24-0.46). The survival curves of L. monocytogenes at all treatment distances showed upward concavity. These findings indicate that the survival of L. monocytogenes on sliced mushrooms subjected to PUV light follows a non-linear trend, and the Weibull model may be a useful tool to predict the behavior of L. monocytogenes on mushroom surface subjected to PUV light. For the quality attributes, zero-order kinetics (R2: 0.8500-0.9974, mean square error (MSE): 1.55*10-8-2.3124) described the changes slightly better compared to first-order kinetics (R2: 0.8451-0.9974, MSE: 1.55*10-8-2.3867). Practical Applications. Pulsed UV light is one of the most effective methods for the control of different pathogenic microorganisms on surfaces of food products. The parameters related to the kinetics of the inactivation of the pathogenic microorganisms in foods such as mushroom are of great importance to maintain food safety. Mathematical models provide practical information about not only tested variables but also untested ones. Process evaluation with mathematical models is useful to verify the effectiveness of the food safety applications. In this study, inactivation of L. monocytogenes on sliced mushroom surface was modeled using log-linear, Weibull, and log-logistic models. In addition, zero-order and first-order kinetics were applied to quality attributes of sliced mushroom in order to better understand the effect of pulsed UV light application. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Foods					Eaters (consumers of food) are responsible for 60% of waste along the food cycle in developed countries. Programs that target individual and household food waste behavior change are essential to addressing such waste. School cafeterias worldwide offer an opportune microcosm in which to educate on food and nutrition skills and change related behavior. No Scrap Left Behind, a cafeteria food waste diversion program, was developed, piloted, and assessed based on measures of both direct and indirect food waste behavior, and attitudes, knowledge, and emotions related to food waste. Participants had positive attitudes towards food waste reduction, engaged in food waste diversion actions, had some knowledge of the impacts of wasted food, and considered their actions important to waste reduction generally. Food waste per student was decreased by 28% over the course of the first year of programming (p = 0.000967), and by 26% in the following year when measured a week before and a week after programming occurred (p = 0.0218). Results. Indicate that students were poised for food behavior change and that related programming did impact behavior in the short term. Programming may, therefore, help improve student attitudes and skills to develop long-term change as well, although future research should explore this specifically. In comparison with other research on cafeteria programming, results suggest that food waste diversion programming can positively impact students' dispositions and behaviors, and may be more effective when tailored to the specific population. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alavi, F.; Lingyun Chen; Emam-Djomeh, Z.							Effect of ultrasound-assisted alkaline treatment on functional property modifications of faba bean protein.		Food Chemistry					This study investigated alkaline shifting, ultrasonication, and their combination on functional modifications of faba bean protein isolate (FPI). The protein characterization revealed that the combined alkaline shifting/ultrasound treatment dissociated large aggregates of FPI into small ones, resulting in increased protein surface hydrophobicity and decreased free sulfhydryl groups. Such structural changes significantly increased FPI solubility from 12.2 to 40.4% to more than 95% at pH 3 and 7 and more than 80% at pH 6. Furthermore, the FPI modified by the combined alkaline shifting/ultrasound treatment produced emulsions with smaller particle size and superior stability at pH values 3 and 7. Likewise, a striking enhancement in foaming capacity (from 93% to 306-386%) and stability (from 10 s to 473-974 s) was achieved by the combined treatment. This study suggested that the ultrasound-assisted alkaline shifting treatment could be considered an effective method for improving FPI functional properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Consequences of heating under alkaline pH alone or in the presence of maltodextrin on solubility, emulsifying and foaming properties of faba bean protein.		Food Hydrocolloids					Faba bean (Vicia faba L.) has attracted interest as a source of plant proteins due to the high protein content, easy cultivation, and the excellent nitrogen-fixing capacity. However, application of faba bean protein is still negligible in food products primarily due to its low solubility and functionality. In the current study, impact of heating under alkaline pH (11.0) alone or in the presence of maltodextrin on physicochemical characteristics, solubility, emulsifying activity, and foaming properties of faba bean protein isolate powder (FBP) from a pilot processing was investigated. Heating at alkaline pH irreversibly disrupted the original large micron-sized aggregates in untreated FBP, along with formation of the smaller aggregates with higher surface hydrophobicity. In the presence of maltodextrin, a FBP-maltodextrin conjugate with high degree of glycation was formed by the heating at alkaline pH. The heating under alkaline pH either in the presence and absence of maltodextrin significantly improved the protein solubility from 43,14, and 35% at pH 3.0,6.0, and 7.0, respectively to more than 90%. Compared to the untreated FBP, the FBP-maltodextrin sample heated at pH 11.0 could produce emulsions that were stable against flocculation and phase separation for 15 days storage at pH 6-7 or in the presence of salt. Moreover, foaming capacity and stability of the FBP and FBP-maltodextrin samples heated at pH 11.0 was greatly improved. This study suggested that heating under alkaline pH has a great potential to improve the functional properties of FBP to enable its wide applications in food area. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Alavijeh, M. K.; Meyer, A. S.; Gras, S. L.; Kentish, S. E.							Synthesis of N-acetyllactosamine and N-acetyllactosamine-based bioactives.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					N-Acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) or more specifically beta-D-galactopyranosyl-1,4-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine is a unique acyl-amino sugar and a key structural unit in human milk oligosaccharides, an antigen component of many glycoproteins, and an antiviral active component for the development of effective drugs against viruses. LacNAc is useful itself and as a basic building block for producing various bioactive oligosaccharides, notably because this synthesis may be used to add value to dairy lactose. Despite a significant amount of information in the literature on the benefits, structures, and types of different LacNAc-derived oligosaccharides, knowledge about their effective synthesis for large-scale production is still in its infancy. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of existing production strategies for LacNAc and important LacNAc-based structures, including sialylated LacNAc as well as poly-and oligo-LacNAc. We conclude that direct extraction from milk is too complex, while chemical synthesis is also impractical at an industrial scale. Microbial routes have application when multiple step reactions are needed, but the major route to large-scale biochemical production will likely lie with enzymatic routes, particularly those using beta-galactosidases (for LacNAc synthesis), sialidases (for sialylated LacNAc synthesis), and beta-N-acetylhexosaminidases (for oligo-LacNAc synthesis). Glycosyltransferases, especially for the biosynthesis of extended complex LacNAc structures, could also play a major role in the future. In these cases, immobilization of the enzyme can increase stability and reduce cost. Processing parameters, such as substrate concentration and purity, acceptor/donor ratio, water activity, and temperature, can affect product selectivity and yield. More work is needed to optimize these reaction parameters and in the development of robust, thermally stable enzymes to facilitate commercial production of these important bioactive substances.

J		Alba, K.; Nguyen, P. T. M.; Kontogiorgos, V.							Sustainable polysaccharides from Malvaceae family: structure and functionality.		Food Hydrocolloids					The structure, technological and biological functionality of polysaccharides extracted from members of Malvaceae family plants have been evaluated. In addition to glycosidic linkages that are regularly observed in pectic polysaccharides, several members of this family, including lacebark, grewia, durian, and some fractions of kola have high levels of 3,4-linked galacturonic acid residues. This specific linkage is commonly found in RG-II structures casting doubts over the true macromolecular characteristics of rhamnogalacturonan segments in these plants, commonly presumed as RG-I. Several members of the family exhibit unique linkages and functionalisation not encountered in other species, such as 4-linked alpha-galactose that is unique to lacebark leave polysaccharides or terminal alpha-galactose in the kola tree bark and okra pectin. Polysaccharides from lacebark and grewia are only acetyl esterified as opposed to those from okra that are both acetyl and methyl esterified whereas those from baobab, durian and cacao have very low amounts of acetyl groups. Polysaccharides from Malvaceae family present opportunities for further technological development in the area of biomaterial science as they have a broad range of functionality allowing them to be used as emulsifiers, film-forming agents, controlled delivery vehicles, or rheology modifiers. Research on the biological activity of polysaccharides from Malvaceae is still nascent but early findings are reassuring, as a broad range of functionalities (e.g., anti-inflammatory, antioxidant or modulation of metabolism) have been reported.

J		Alba, K.; Dimopoulou, M.; Kontogiorgos, V.							Baobab polysaccharides as emulsifiers.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Polysaccharides extracted from fruits and leaves of baobab tree (Adansonia digitata) were assessed for their emulsifying capacity. Emulsions were formed at acidic pH (pH 2.0 and Phi = 0.1) and were investigated by means of droplet size distribution analysis, zeta-potential measurements, and interfacial composition analysis. Despite the macromolecular differences of baobab polysaccharides all emulsions were formulated at concentrations resulting in comparable zero shear viscosity of the continuous phase allowing structure vs. function relationships to be made. Emulsions made with fruit polysaccharides formed finer droplets and exhibited good long term stability than those formulated with leaf polysaccharides. Stability was achieved by formation of thick interfacial layers, as evidenced by the large polysaccharide interfacial loading (Gammapolysaccharide 13.8 or 20.7 mg m-2) that created an effective steric barrier against droplet growth, whereas proteins did not seem to play central role. Fruit polysaccharide emulsification performance at acidic pH was attributed to their compact conformation at the interface that is linked to their structure. Conversely, the presence of rhamnogalacturonan segments in leaf polysaccharides resulted in chain desorption and poor emulsion stability. Overall, it has been shown that baobab fruit polysaccharides could be suitable emulsifiers for a range of technological applications that require low pH stability. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Barley grains contain a variable amount of biologically active compounds such as non-starch polysaccharides and phenol compounds. These compounds are important in nutrition due to their significant health benefits and technological role in food. We developed predictive models for beta-glucans (BG), arabinoxylans (AX), bound phenols (BP), free phenols (FP), and anthocyanins (AN) based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) using two different NIRS instruments with different spectral range and spectral steps. Regressions of modified partial least squares (MPLS) and several combinations of scattering correction and derivative treatments were tested. The optimal calibration models generated high coefficients of determination for BG and BP, but not for AN content. The instrument with the highest resolution only gave better results for BG prediction models, and the addition of the visible range did not prove to be ostensibly advantageous to the determination of any of the active compounds of study, not even in the case of AN analysis.

J		Albayrak, A. B.; Duran, M.							Isolation and characterization of aroma producing lactic acid bacteria from artisanal white cheese for multifunctional properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study is to isolate and characterize potential aroma producing lactic acid bacteria with some probiotic properties from artisanal cheese environment. For this purpose, 40 of lactic acid bacteria isolates were obtained from traditionally produced White cheese samples. They were preliminary characterized in Enterococcus genus by morphological, physiological, biochemical tools. Technological properties such as milk acidifying, lipolytic and proteolytic activities were also screened. Most of them were good acid producers. Aroma producing ability was determined by diacetyl production and among 40 isolates, 18 of them could produce this compound. DNA isolation and 16 S rRNA ribosomal gene sequence analysis of selected isolates indicated that they were identified as E. faecium, E. faecalis and E. durans. Aroma producers were screened for their probiotic characteristics and they showed variable acid tolerance, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, antimicrobial activity and antibiotic sensitivity. All of them tolerated bile salt. In conclusion, particularly two isolate, MD 30 and MD 38 identified as E. faecium were found to be the most promising bacteria due to both technological and probiotic traits.

Physicochemical, nutritional, microbiological, and sensory qualities of chicken burgers reformulated with mediterranean plant ingredients and health-promoting compounds.		Foods					The quality of chicken burgers reformulated by the partial replacement of meat by Mediterranean plant ingredients and enriched with peculiar amounts of n-3 PUFAs, Mg, Fe, Se, and folic acid, was evaluated in comparison to conventional chicken burgers. Specifically, two types of burger were developed, namely the "Sicilian burger"-based on cherry tomato and rosemary-and the "Mediterranean burger"-with basil leaves and thyme essential oil-every recipe being differentially functionalized according to the nutritional requirements of consumers, such as children, pregnant women and elderly. Mediterranean ingredients were responsible for different pH, color, and cooking loss between conventional and functional burgers. Except for n-3 PUFAs resulting poorly fortified, the functionalization with Mg, Fe, Se, and vitamin B9 was successful in all products. Considering the target consumer categories, the daily consumption of the functional burger may assure an intake of Mg, Fe, and Se equal, respectively, to 37.31-59.90%, 17.76-46.81%, and 27.20-50.05%, and a cover of vitamin B9 of 31.98-48.31% of the relative population reference intakes. Fortified products kept a good microbiological quality during 5 days of refrigerated storage, and, according to the sensorial descriptive analysis and the hedonic test, they showed a higher acceptability than conventional burgers. © 2021 by the authors.

Development of an antioxidant formula based on peanut by-products and effects on sensory properties and aroma stability of fortified peanut snacks during storage.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. An antioxidant formula based on peanut skins and hulls was developed and characterized for total and single polyphenols, as well as antioxidant power, considering the contribution provided by each peanut by-product. Subsequently, it was evaluated for its effect on the sensory properties and aroma stability of peanut bars over a 100-day period. To this purpose, snacks fortified, or not, with the natural additive were experimentally produced. Results. Peanut hulls contributed to a greater extent than skins with respect to boosting the content of bioactives and the antioxidnt activity of the antioxidant formula, which was marked by a phenol content of (approximately 807mg gallic acid equivalents g-1) and a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl activity similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene (85.96% and 89.30%, respectively). From a sensory perspective, the incorporation of the formulation in snacks caused only a slightly stronger perception of astringent and bitter notes. Pyrazines, phenol, furan and pyrrole derivatives defined the aroma of snacks, being more abundant in fortified than in conventional samples. Such volatiles faded over storage, with different trends in the examined products. For example, the sum of 2,5-dimethylpyrazine, 2-ethylpyrazine and 2,3-dimethylpyrazine was 9.49 and 8.87ppm at day 15; 5.57 and 7.16ppm at day 45; and 5.03 and 4.65ppm at day 100, respectively, in fortified and conventional snacks. Hydroxymethylfurfural decreased constantly over storage in conventional samples and only after day 45 in fortified bars. Conclusion. Overall, the antioxidant formulation did not compromise the sensory desirability of peanut snacks and induced a preservative effect on their aroma, especially during the first 15days of storage. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Enzymatic detoxification of the fumonisin mycotoxins during dry milling of maize.		Food Control					Fumonisin esterase FumD (EC 3.1.1.87), FUMzyme (BIOMIN, Austria), effectively detoxifies fumonisin B mycotoxins (FB) by hydrolysis and removal of the tricarballylic acid groups. The current study evaluated FumD detoxification of total FB (FBT) in commercial maize utilising an experimental dry milling plant by introducing the enzyme during the kernel conditioning stage. Total FB and the hydrolysed product of FB1, HFB1, in maize and milling products were determined by LC-MS/MS. During maize conditioning of 4 h 10 min substantial FB1 hydrolysis was achieved between 1 and 4 U FumD/100 g maize. Complete conversion into HFB1 was delayed and only achieved at the highest enzyme concentration (32 U/100 g maize) reaching a 1:1 M conversion ratio. Dry milling of maize containing 3.29 0.20 mumole FBT/kg (2354 140 mug/kg) in the absence of FumD, resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in the FBT concentration in total hominy feed (8.34 0.22 mumol/kg) (5979 158 mug/kg) compared to the levels that prevail in Super (0.52 0.07 mumol/kg) (347 48 mug/kg) and Special (1.70 0.01 mumol/kg) (1213 8 mug/kg) maize meal, and Semolina (1.07 0.14 mumol/kg) (765 100 mug/kg) milling products. Introduction of FumD (40 U/kg) mainly impacted the total hominy feed product (germ + hominy milling fractions), constituting up to 30% of the reconstituted whole maize. A 99% reduction in FBT was obtained in total hominy feed, 48% in Semolina, 7% in Special maize meal, whereas no reduction was recorded in Super maize meal. FB1 reduction rates depend on the contamination level, kernel moisture and the diffusion rate from inner kernel layers to the kernel surface/aqueous interface. Risk modelling in children and adults indicated that FumD-treated whole maize and the resultant Semolina milling product intended for human consumption reduces the risk of exposure to FBT. However, no reduction in the exposure risk was observed when considering the Super and Special maize meal milling products. FB reduction in total hominy feed could open up new applications, such as its dietary incorporation as a source of fibre, minerals and bioactive plant constituents in maize-based food. In addition, the animal feed industry and subsistence maize farming communities using rudimentary milling processes, could also benefit.

Practical applications of sensor-based methodologies for monitoring peracetic acid (PAA) as a disinfectant of fresh produce wash water.		Food Control					An accurate sensor for peracetic acid (PAA) is needed to monitor and control the disinfection of fresh produce wash water. Inaccurate measurements can result in underdosing and unsafe produce or overdosing with huge cost implications. In this study, five methods were compared for measuring PAA in process water from washing apples, tomatoes, red sweet peppers, and lemons. A reversed phase HPLC-DAD method for the determination of PAA in water was adapted for process wash water and used as a reference method. The results showed that HPLC offered high selectivity for PAA and precise and reproducible measurement for its quantification. However, as HPLC is not suitable for in-line applications in processing plants and requires highly skilled technicians, installation and maintenance costs, other analytical methods were examined including a redox titration, a reflectometric method and two electrochemical methods (an amperometric in-line probe and a chronoamperometric method with disposable single-use electrode sensor). The drop titration kit overestimated PAA because of the interferences from other oxidizing agents such as hydrogen peroxide (HP) apart from it required substantial time to perform the measurements plus the extensive training of the technical personnel to ensure confidence in the results. The reflectometric method with disposable test strips, although fast and objective, overestimated PAA due to the wash water with a high content of suspended organic matter that needed the addition of high concentrations of PAA, coexisting with HP. From the two electrochemical methods studied, the in-line amperometric sensor underestimated the PAA concentration in lemon wash water as the PAA could not freely diffuse through the membrane through the active electrode because of the organic matter present in the wash water released from the lemon peel. In contrast, the chronoamperometric sensor showed good selectivity for PAA without interferences, with reliable results across all the wash water types and PAA concentrations.

J		Albrecht, A.; Mittler, M.; Hebel, M.; Waldhans, C.; Herbert, U.; Kreyenschmidt, J.							A multi-model approach to implement a dynamic shelf life criterion in meat supply chains.		Foods					The high perishability of fresh meat results in short sales and consumption periods, which can lead to high amounts of food waste, especially when a fixed best-before date is stated. Thus, the aim of this study was the development of a real-time dynamic shelf-life criterion (DSLC) for fresh pork filets based on a multi-model approach combining predictive microbiology and sensory modeling. Therefore, 647 samples of ma-packed pork loin were investigated in isothermal and non-isothermal storage trials. For the identification of the most suitable spoilage predictors, typical meat quality parameters (pH-value, color, texture, and sensory characteristics) as well as microbial contamination (total viable count, Pseudomonas spp., lactic acid bacteria, Brochothrix thermosphacta, Enterobacteriaceae) were analyzed at specific investigation points. Dynamic modeling was conducted using a combination of the modified Gompertz model (microbial data) or a linear approach (sensory data) and the Arrhenius model. Based on these models, a four-point scale grading system for the DSLC was developed to predict the product status and shelf-life as a function of temperature data in the supply chain. The applicability of the DSLC was validated in a pilot study under real chain conditions and showed an accurate real-time prediction of the product status. © 2021 by the authors.

Valorization of Sicanaodorifera (Vell.) naudin epicarp as a source of bioactive compounds: chemical characterization and evaluation of its bioactive properties.		Foods					Fruit bio-residues can be interesting for the recovery of bioactive molecules, such as phenolic compounds, tocopherols, vitamins, among others. These compounds can be targeted at the food industry and used for the development of functional foods or as food additives. In some cases, fruit epicarps are converted into by-products with non-commercial value, and generally, these fruit parts have a higher content in bioactive compounds than the fruit pulp. From this perspective, S. odorifera, a Brazilian fruit, has an inedible epicarp that could be explored to obtain biological compounds. Therefore, the aims of this study were to evaluate the chemical composition and the antioxidant, anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antimicrobial bioactivities of this by-product. S. odorifera epicarp showed a total of four organic acids, four phenolic compounds, highlighting the high concentration of anthocyanins (24 1 mg/g dry weight (dw)) and high content of tocopherols (366 2 mg/100 g dw). The hydroethanolic extract showed considerable antioxidant activity (EC50 values of 48.2 0.5 and 27 1 g/mL for TBARS and OxHLIA assays, respectively), as also antibacterial and antifungal activities (minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ≤ 2.2 mg/mL). The results obtained in this study suggest that Sicana odorifera epicarp represents a reliable option for the development of novel natural-based colorants with functional/bioactive proprieties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Albuquerque, C. D. de; Curet, S.; Boillereaux, L.							Influence of heating rate during microwave pasteurization of ground beef products: experimental and numerical study.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					A finite element model coupling electromagnetism with standing-wave propagation, heat transfer and microbial inactivation equations has been developed to study microwave food pasteurization with three heating rates (7, 10, and 13 °C/min). Inactivation of a target microorganism was studied from a single temperature measurement at a given location. Electric fields, temperature distribution and inactivation kinetics were predicted as a function of time and space coordinates. Good agreement was found between experimental and predicted thermal and inactivation curves. The inactivation kinetics parameters (D and z-value) identified under water bath heating remained valid during the microwave process. Thus, the E. coli inactivation is mainly due to the thermal effect under lethal conditions. The differences between logarithmic reductions between both heating processes was attributed to the non-uniform temperature distribution. Practical Applications. From the industrial point of view, temperature heterogeneity is known to be the main barrier impeding the development of microwave food pasteurization technology. The use of a multiphysics model that takes into account the real geometry of the microwave cavity made it possible to optimize the process and achieve a more uniform temperature distribution within the product. Therefore, the simulation of the electric field distribution can provide relevant information on the amplitude and shape of the electromagnetic field. The degrees of freedom of the model led to the optimization of parameters, such as cavity size, microwave frequency shifting, product mass, the position of the sample in the cavity, and the optimization of the shape of the product containers and supports. The combination of microwaves (with or without modulated power input) with other energy sources (i.e., hot air injection, immersion of the product in water) also seemed promising for pasteurization applications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	7			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13722					FSTA:2021-10-Sg6258

The price of homemade street food in central Asia and eastern Europe: is there a relation with its nutritional value?		Foods					The aim was to describe the price of homemade street foods in four cities of Central Asia and Eastern Europe and to analyze its association with energy density, macronutrients, sodium and potassium contents. Cross-sectional evaluations of street food vending sites were conducted in Dushanbe, Tajikistan (n=562), Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan (n=384), Almaty, Kazakhstan (n=236) and Chisinau, Moldova (n=89) in 2016-2017. Information on the homemade street foods available, including price, was systematically collected; the most commonly available foods (n=64) were sampled for chemical analysis. Prices were converted to international dollars ($) and expressed as $/serving, $/100 g and $/100 kcal. The median street food price was $1.00/serving, $0.85/100 g and $0.33/100 kcal. Traditional foods were cheaper per 100 g than the westernized ($0.77 vs. $1.00, p=0.011). For each unit increase in energy density (kcal/g), the homemade street foods were $0.12 cheaper per 100 kcal and $0.11 more expensive per 100 g. The carbohydrate content was negatively associated with price per 100 kcal, while total fat, monounsaturated, saturated and trans-fatty acids content were positively associated with price per 100 g. Energy-dense homemade street foods were the cheapest. Further insight on food preparation might clarify the association between carbohydrates and monounsaturated fatty acids content and street food price. © 2021 by the authors.

Ultrasound treatment for improving the bioactive compounds and quality properties of a Brazilian nopal (Opuntia ficus-indica) beverage during shelf-life.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The use of ultrasound treatment for improving the bioactive compounds and quality properties of a Brazilian nopal beverage was studied. Physicochemical characterization and possible changes in nutritional, microbiological, and sensory parameters throughout the shelf-life were evaluated, and compared with heat treatment. Five products were prepared and analyzed during 28 days of shelf-life: control without treatment (C0), beverage submitted to heat treatment for 10 min (HP10), and beverages submitted to ultrasound treatment for 10 (US10), 20 (US20), and 40 (US40) min, with these times being defined based on a previously conducted pilot study. The US40 beverage presented the highest levels of oligosaccharides (31.99%), organic (48.93%) and ascorbic (26.09%) acids, and minerals (83.59%) compared to those found for HP10. The US40 also showed better antioxidant activity and 81.80% more phenolic compounds when compared with the HP10. The US40 presented greater stability for bioactive compounds and showed fewer changes in the color parameters, lower microorganism count, and greater acceptability regarding quality during shelf-life, while the HP10 sample presented the worst results. Therefore, the US40 beverage has higher functional potential, and ultrasound represents a promising technique to preserve or improve the quality of this product during its processing and shelf-life.

Effects of digested flours from four different sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) root varieties on the composition and metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota in vitro.		Journal of Food Science					This study evaluated the effects of flours from four different sweet potato root (SPR) varieties, being two with white peel and two with purple peel, on the composition and metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota in vitro. The capability of these SPR flours (20 g/L) to cause alterations in relative abundance of different bacterial groups found as part of human colonic microbiota, as well as in lactic acid and short-chain fatty acid production was evaluated during 48 hr of an in vitro colonic fermentation. The SPR flours were submitted to a simulated gastrointestinal digestion prior to use in experiments. The four SPR flours increased the relative abundance of Lactobacillus/Enterococcus (range: 0.49-4.48%) and Bifidobacterium (range: 0.32-3.27%) and decreased the relative abundance of Bacteroides/Prevotella (range: 0.29-7.49%), Clostridium histolyticum (range: 0.15-2.08%), and Eubacterium rectale/Clostridium coccoides (range: 0.28-3.86%) during the 48 hr of colonic fermentation. The four SPRF flours had positive prebiotic indexes (> 0.38) after 24 and 48 hr of colonic fermentation, reinforcing the occurrence of selective stimulatory effects on colonic microbiota. An increased metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota was caused by tested SPR flours, which was evidenced by decreased pH (range: 3.20-3.83) and increased lactic acid and short chain fatty acid production during the 48 hr of colonic fermentation. The four examined SPR flours were capable of causing positive alterations in composition and driving the metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota during in vitro colonic fermentation, which should be linked to their prebiotic properties. Practical Application. The four examined sweet potato root flours (SPRF) caused beneficial alterations in composition besides of driving the metabolic activity of human colonic microbiota in vitro. These results characterize the examined SPRF as candidates for use as prebiotic ingredients by food industry for formulation of value-added functional foods or dietary supplements. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	8	3707	3719	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15852					FSTA:2021-12-Jk16252

Identification of intact peptides by top-down peptidomics reveals cleavage spots in thermolabile wine proteins.		Food Chemistry					Prevention of haze formation in wines is challenging for winemakers. Thermolabile proteins in wines, notably thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs) and chitinases (CHIs), undergo structural changes under varying physicochemical conditions, resulting in protein aggregation and visible haze in bottled products. Peptidases are an alternative fining method, although an effective proteolysis under typical winemaking conditions (acidic pH and low temperature) is difficult to achieve. In this study, tryptic peptides from TLPs and CHIs were identified by MS-based peptidomics (top-down proteomics) after exposure of scissile bonds on the protein surface. As proposed by the theory of limited proteolysis, protein conformational changes following temperature and pH variations allowed the detection of enzyme-accessible regions. Protein structure visualization and molecular dynamics simulations were used to highlight cleavage spots and provide the scientific basis for haze formation mechanisms. The described method offers a tool to the search for ideal enzymes to prevent wine haze. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Albuquerque, W.; Seidel, L.; Zorn, H.; Will, F.; Gand, M.							Haze formation and the challenges for peptidases in wine protein fining.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					To meet consumer expectations, white wines must be clear and stable against haze formation. Temperature variations during transport and storage may induce protein aggregation, mainly caused by thaumatin like-proteins (TLPs) and chitinases (CHIs), which thus need to be fined before bottling of the wine. Currently, bentonite clay is employed to inhibit or minimize haze formation in wines. Alternatively, peptidases have emerged as an option for the removal of these thermolabile proteins, although their efficacy under winemaking conditions has not yet been fully demonstrated. The simultaneous understanding of the chemistry behind the cleavage of haze proteins and the haze formation may orchestrate alternative methods of technological and economic importance in winemaking. Therefore, we provide an overview of wine fining by peptidases, and new perspectives are developed to reopen discussions on the aforementioned challenges.

Healthy snacking in the school environment: exploring children and mothers' perspective using projective techniques.		Food Quality and Preference					Snacks consumed at school are an important source of energy and nutrients in children's diets. Understanding the factors that underlie children and mothers' choices of school snacks can contribute to the development of strategies to promote healthier eating patterns. In this context, the aims of the present work were: i) to explore children's conceptualization of school snacking, and ii) to identify children and mothers' perceived barriers and facilitators to healthy snacking in the school environment. Two studies with 518 children and 1183 mothers were carried out. In Study 1, children (n=255) were asked to draw a child eating a snack at school. In Study 2, five incomplete dialogues about school snacks were presented to participants (263 children and 1183 mothers), who had to complete them using their own words. Data were analyzed using content analysis. The drawings showed that school snacking frequently occurs during the recess while children do other activities, such as playing football or other games. Fruit, sandwiches, cookies and juices were the foods and beverages most frequently included in the drawings. Responses to the dialogues enabled the identification of barriers to healthy snacking in the school environment, which were related to children's positive hedonic reaction towards unhealthy foods, the sales of unhealthy products in the school canteen, lack of time to prepare home-made snacks and mothers' perception that children can eat unhealthy snacks once in a while. In addition, the existence of a school snacking policy was mentioned as a facilitator for healthy snacking. Potential additional actions to promote healthy snacking habits in the school environment were identified.

Food Chemistry					Coffee beans contain different volatile and non-volatile compounds that are responsible for their flavor and aroma. Herein, principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to correlate the non-volatile composition of specialty and traditional coffees with drink quality. The quantified non-volatile compounds included caffeine, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and nicotinic acid in both types of coffee samples, while 5-hydroxymethylfurfural was only quantified in the specialty coffee samples. The most abundant compounds present in specialty coffees were associated with the aroma and flavor, affording a high drink quality. In traditional coffees, the most abundant compounds included nicotinic acid and caffeine, indicating a stronger roasting process, loss of sensory characteristics, and blended formulations. PCA showed a distinction between the traditional and specialty coffees such that a relationship between the contents of the compounds in each type of coffee, quality, and classification could be established.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					Environmental problems have encouraged investigation of renewable energies. The organic waste treating through fast pyrolysis seems to be a highly promising option for decreasing pollutants. Olive pomace, a major source of waste in countries with high production of olive oil (mainly Spain, Italy, and Greece), is a clear target for valorisation. Dried olive pomace together with the ashes obtained during the drying process was blended to study the influence of the inorganic metals inherently present in the ashes (K, Na, Ca and Mg) for fast pyrolysis product distribution. The results determined that these metals increased yields of phenolic compounds until a maximum was reached, whereas carboxylic acid yield fell due to the action of metals. In addition, aromatic hydrocarbons and polyphenols were obtained for those samples with a large amount of ash. Moreover, the formation of organic acids, such as acetic acid, requires a smaller proportion of ash in the blend. Finally, it has been found that the ashes could be used as a catalyst for producing better quality bio-oil, thereby avoiding extra costs and thus valorizing the industrial treatment olive pomace.

J		Alcine Chan, M. Z.; Mingzhan Toh; Shao-Quan Liu							Growth, survival, and metabolic activities of probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii CNCM-I745 in fermented coffee brews.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Amidst rising demand for non-dairy probiotic foods, and growing interest in coffees with added functionalities, it would be opportune to ferment coffee brews with probiotics. However, challenges exist in maintaining probiotic viability in high-moisture food products. Here, we aimed to enhance the viability of the probiotic bacteria, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, in coffee brews by co-culturing with the probiotic yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii CNCM-I745. The yeast significantly enhanced the viability of L. rhamnosus GG, as bacterial populations beyond 7 Log CFU/mL were maintained throughout 14weeks of storage at 4 and 25 °C. In contrast, the single culture of L. rhamnosus GG suffered viability losses below 6 Log CFU/mL within 10 weeks at 4 °C, and 3 weeks at 25 °C. Growth and survival of S. boulardii CNCM-I745 remained unaffected by the presence of L. rhamnosus GG. Volatile profiles of coffee brews were altered by probiotic metabolic activities, but co-culturing led to suppressed generation of diacetyl and ethanol compared to single cultures. Probiotic fermentation did not alter principal coffee bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacities; however, declines in peroxyl radical scavenging capacities were observed after ambient storage. Overall, we illustrate that yeasts are effective in enhancing probiotic bacterial viability in coffee brews, which may be useful in developing shelf stable probiotic food products.

Relationships between cheese-processing conditions and curd and cheese properties to improve the yield of Idiazabal cheese made in small artisan dairies: a multivariate approach.		Journal of Dairy Science					Very diverse cutting and cooking intensity processes are currently used in small artisan dairies to manufacture Idiazabal cheese. The combination of the technical settings used during cheese manufacturing is known to affect cheese composition and yield, as well as whey losses. However, the information regarding the effect on microstructure and texture of cheese is scarce, especially in commercial productions. Therefore, the effect of moderate- and high-intensity cutting and cooking processes on whey losses, curd-grain characteristics, microstructure and cheese properties, and yield were analyzed. Three trials were monitored in each of 2 different small dairies during the cheesemaking of Idiazabal cheese, which is a semihard cheese made from raw sheep milk. The role and know-how of the cheesemakers are crucial in these productions because they determine the cutting point and handle semi-automatic vats. The 2 dairies studied used the following settings: dairy A used moderate-intensity cutting and cooking conditions, and dairy B used high-intensity cutting and cooking settings. Multiple relationships between cheese-processing conditions and curd, whey, and cheese properties as well as yield were obtained from a partial least square regression analysis. An increased amount of fat and casein losses were generated due to a combination of an excessively firm gel at cutting point together with high-intensity cutting and cooking processes. The microstructural analysis revealed that the porosity of the protein matrix of curd grains after cooking and cheese after pressing was the main feature affected, developing a less porous structure with a more intense process. Moderate-intensity cutting and cooking processes were associated with a higher cheese yield, regardless of the longer pressing process applied. No significant differences were observed in cheese composition. After 1 mo of ripening, however, the cheese was more brittle and adhesive when the high-intensity cutting and cooking process was applied. This could be associated with the composition, characteristics, and size distribution of curd grains due to differences in the compaction degree during pressing. These results could help to modify specific conditions used in cheesemaking, especially improving the process in those small dairies where the role of the cheesemaker is crucial.

Food Hydrocolloids					Starch performance along digestion is becoming of utmost importance owing to the extensive presence of starch in foods and its association to the foods glycaemic index. However, scarce information exists on the relationship between the digestibility of starch gels and their microstructure. The aim of the study was to identify the rate and degree of digestion of starch gels from different botanical sources and the impact of gels microstructure with the in vitro starch digestibility (IVSD) by fitting the hydrolysis kinetics. Starch gels from cereals, tubers, and pulses were structurally analyzed and subjected to a standardized oro-gastrointestinal IVSD. The gel microstructure was significantly different among starches. Cereal gels had thinner walls than tuber and pulses gels, and this discrimination was not evident in the area of the gel cavities. Starches hydrolysis was well fitted to a first-order kinetics model, except for rice starch gel. Potato and chickpea gels showed the slowest digestion, and in the case of potato gel some starch remained undigested at the end of the digestion. The amylose content of gels was correlated with starch hydrolysis rate. Moreover, starch gels with thinner walls and/or bigger cavities seems to facilitate the enzyme action, and therefore, the starch digestibility.

Food Research International					Texture and structure of breads have been related to oral processing (FOP) performance and sensory perceptions, but moisture content might play a significant role. To evaluate the real impact of breads texture and structure, eliminating the possible role of moisture content, different toasted breads were investigated. Four commercial toasted sliced breads (white bread-WHB-, whole wheat bread-WWB-, non-added sugar bread-NSU-, non-added salt bread-NSA-) with similar ingredients but different texture and structure were selected. Texture and structure were instrumentally and sensory evaluated, besides FOP (total chewing time, number of chews until swallowing, chewing frequency, and mouthful) and bolus properties (moisture, saliva to bread ratio, hardness, adhesiveness, and cohesiveness). Toasted breads showed significant differences in hardness, cutting strength, and porosity, but panelists did not discriminate among them. FOP results indicated that harder samples (NSU) required longer mastication and a number of chews, and open crumb structures (WWB, WHB) with higher cell areas required less mastication. Also, bolus characteristics were affected by bread types, and bread with lower crumb hardness (WHB) produced more cohesive bolus. Having toasted breads allowed to eliminate possible influence of moisture content differences on sensory perception, mouthful and bolus water incorporation during mastication.

Food Chemistry					The quality of wine grapes depends on the balance between primary and secondary metabolites. Unlike many perennial crops that accumulate starch in the fruits before ripening, the non-climacteric grapes ripe with no previous carbon reserves. Based on the assumption that fruit carbon sink is limiting metabolite accumulation in grapes, bunch thinning is performed to limit plant Sink/Source (S/S). We studied the effects of severe bunch thinning on the accumulation of primary metabolites and on four families of glycosylated aroma precursors (GAPs) at the arrest of fruit phloem unloading of two white grape Vitis vinifera cvs. At plant level, crop reduction resulted in significant losses of metabolites to be accumulated in the fruits: i.e.up to 72% for sugars, 75% for organic acids and GAPs. Nevertheless, S/S manipulation could not modify the balance between GAPs and primary metabolites or increase the concentration in GAPs in the physiologically ripe grape.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important ingredient for the development of gluten free bakery products. The quality of these types of products varies depending on the levels of rice amylose, particle size of the rice flour, rice grain length as related to amylose content, water absorption rate and the use of other ingredients such as hydrocolloids. This research work was aimed to develop a cupcake using high protein brown rice flour (HPBRF) in combination with tapioca starch (TF) and potato starch (PS) of which the formulations were evaluated for textural properties, specific volume, and sensory attributes, using a Simplex-Centroid mixture design. In addition, rheological, pasting, and chemical attributes were evaluated for the high protein brown rice flour, tapioca starch & potato starch. In the development of the cupcake formulations, starch incorporation increased the cupcakes specific volume from 2.32 mL/g to a maximum of 3.85 mL/g and decreased hardness from 10.62 N to 1.9 N. As a result, the optimized formulation recommended to compare by sensory evaluation to a wheat flour cupcake (control) was 60 g/100 g brown rice flour, 30.7 g/100 g tapioca starch and 9.3 g/100 g potato starch giving a 100% desirability with an overall liking of 6.96.

Accordingly, it was found that the bioaccessibility of HT derivatives is largely dependent on the type of FA that esterifies HT, as well as the food matrix. Also, the generation of HT-FAs during intestinal digestion was observed, with pancreatin being the enzyme responsible, to a higher extent, for the de novo formation of lipophenolic derivatives. These findings prompt us to identify new applications to oily matrices and their byproducts as potential functional ingredients for the promotion of health, where the possible formation of new lipophenols during digestion should be taken into consideration.

J		Alemneh, S. T.; Emire, S. A.; Hitzmann, B.							Teff-based probiotic functional beverage fermented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus plantarum.		Foods					Consumers are demanding healthier foods, and the increasing drawbacks associated with dairy-based products have driven efforts to find plant-based probiotic alternatives. Consequently, this study aimed to evaluate the suitability of a teff-based substrate for delivering the potential probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) and Lactobacillus plantarum A6 (LA6) with a view to developing probiotic functional beverages. Single-strain and mixed-strain fermentations were performed without any pH control. In single-strain fermentation, LA6 grew to 8.157-8.349 log cfu/mL. Titratable acidity (TA) and pH were measured between 0.513-1.360 g/L and 4.25-3.91, respectively. The explored optimum variables were fermentation time (15 h) and inoculum (6 log cfu/mL). As a result of fermentation, maltose and glucose decreased, but lactic and acetic acids increased. In mixed-strain fermentation, LGG and LA6 were able to grow to 8.247 and 8.416 log cfu/mL, respectively. The pH, TA, lactic, and acetic acids varied between 6.31-3.92,0.329-1.501 g/L, 0-1672 mg/L, and 20-231.5 mg/L, respectively. In both fermentations, microbial growth reached the stationary phase close to a pH of 4.21-4.82 while sugars were not consumed completely. Less than 5% ethanol was detected, which indicated a non-alcoholic beverage. A combination of the two evaluated lactobacilli strains reduced fermentation time. In conclusion, a substrate made of whole grain teff flour without any supplement could be used as a substrate to produce functional probiotic beverages. © 2021 by the authors.

Meat Science					Lean Meat Yield (LMY, %) of carcass is an important industry trait, which currently is not routinely measured in Australian beef abattoirs. Objective on-line technology to determine LMY is key for wider adoption. This paper presents a proof-of-concept approach for estimating the LMY of beef carcasses from the 3D information provided by RGB-D cameras. Moreover, a specifically designed on-line data acquisition system for abattoir applications is presented, consisting of three cameras moving on a scanning rig to generate 3D carcass side reconstructions. The hindquarter is then segmented consistently across all the 3D models to extract curvature information and LMY estimated via non-linear regression based on Gaussian Process models. Sides from 119 carcasses at two different commercial abattoirs were used to evaluate this approach. Results from this preliminary study (RMSE = 3.91%, R2 = 0.69) using curvature, P8 fat and HSCW indicate that 3D imaging of beef carcasses is a viable and relatively accurate technology to estimate LMY.

Genetic analysis of grain protein content and dough quality traits in elite spring bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) lines through association study.		Journal of Cereal Science					Wheat quality parameters are complex traits predominantly influenced by the genetic background of varieties. A total of 802 spring bread wheat breeding lines were tested at Marchouch station, Morocco in 2018 aimed at mining invaluable QTNs for grain protein content (PR), gluten content (GL), alveograph strength (W) and zeleny sedimentation test (Z). A single-locus (MLM) and multi-locus (FarmCPU) GWAS models were implemented using 5,095 SNP markers generated from the genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) platform. A total of 36 and 92 QTNs were detected for the four quality traits from the MLM and FarmCPU GWAS models, respectively. The FarmCPU model detected markers on homoeologous chromosome group one having highly significant QTNs with PR, GL, W and Z traits. The two implemented GWAS models detected significant QTNs on the short arm of homoeologous chromosome groups 2 and 6 for GL, PR, W and Z traits. FarmCPU model detected SNP_615 302 marker on chromosome 3B with highly significant MTAs and concurrent effect for PR, GL and W traits. Moreover, significant MTAs were detected on chromosomes 3D, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, 7A, 7B and 7D for the four studied quality traits across the two GWAS models. The in-silico gene annotation for QTNs using the high confidence gene models detected genes involved in numerous functions including regulating plant growth, development and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The identified markers could potentially be useful tool for quality improvement through marker-assisted selection in future breeding programs. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Chemical extraction and gastrointestinal digestion of honey: influence on its antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities.		Foods					The effect of chemical extraction and in vitro digestion of different kinds of honey on bioactive compounds (total phenolic compounds and flavonoids) and biological activities (antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory) was investigated. The antioxidant activity was evaluated against three radicals (ABTS+, ROO, OH), and the antimicrobial activity was studied against five bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus mutans and Pseudomona aeruginosa) and one yeast (Candida albicans). The results show that in comparison with raw honeys, the methanolic extracts exhibited lower values for phenols, flavonoids and antioxidant activity and higher anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial activities against L. monocytogenes. The higher anti-inflammatory activity indicates a possible use of dried honey extracts in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries. The digested honeys showed higher total phenolics and higher antioxidant activity than the pre-digested honeys, as well as higher antimicrobial activity against S. aureus and L. monocytogenes, which underlines the possible antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of honey in the human body after the digestion process. © 2021 by the authors.

High-temperature oxidation reduces the bitterness of honeybush infusions depending on changes in phenolic composition.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Honeybush tea infusions, especially those prepared from Cyclopia genistoides, can be unacceptably bitter, given the association of this herbal tea with sweet taste. Infusions prepared from both "fermented" (high-temperature oxidised) Cyclopia longifolia and C. genistoides contain high levels of the bitter xanthone, mangiferin, however, C. longifolia is generally less bitter than C. genistoides. The effect of phenolic changes during fermentation on the bitterness of infusions was determined for both species. Bitterness was reduced by 34-68% for C. genistoides and 55-86% for C. longifolia. Fermentation affected the phenolic composition of the two species differently, notably the ratio of mangiferin to isomangiferin remained higher for C. genistoides. Bitterness prediction models for two data sets of infusions (126 fermented and green plant material; 122 fermented plant material) including variable selection based on phenolic content gave good performance (RMSECV < 5). Nine compounds, depending on the data set, were determined to be important for the models, including xanthones, benzophenones, flavones and flavanones. Mangiferin, two tetrahydroxyxanthone-di-O, C-hexose isomers, 3-beta-d-glucopyranosyliriflophenone, vicenin-2 and scolymoside were common to both models. Future application of the model would be to screen large numbers of genotypes for the breeding of selections with low bitterness potential based on phenolic composition.

Emergent technologies for the extraction of antioxidants from prickly pear peel and their antimicrobial activity.		Foods					Phenolic compounds are important bioactive compounds identified in prickly pear peel that have important antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. However, conventional thermal extraction methods may reduce their bioactivity, and technologies such as high pressure (HP) and ohmic heating (OH) may help preserve them. In this study, both technologies were analyzed, individually and combined (250/500 MPa; 40/70 °C; ethanol concentration 30/70%), and compared with Soxhlet with regard to total phenolics, flavonoids, and carotenoids as well as antioxidant (ABTS, DPPH, ORAC), DNA pro-oxidant, and antimicrobial (inhibition halos, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), growth curves, and viable cells) activities of prickly pear peel extracts. Total phenolics extracted by each technology increased 103% (OH) and 98% (HP) with regard to Soxhlet, but the contents of total flavonoids and carotenoids were similar. Antioxidant activity increased with HP and OH (between 35% and 63%), and OH (70 °C) did not induce DNA degradation. The phenolic compound present in higher amounts was piscidic acid, followed by eucomic acid and citrate. In general, their extraction was significantly favored by HP and OH. Antimicrobial activity against 7 types of bacteria showed effective results only against S. aureus, S. enteritidis, and B. cereus. No synergetic or additive effect was observed for HP/OH. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

International Dairy Journal					Our previous study on a model microbial community originating from an artisanal cheese fermentation starter revealed that bacteriophages not only co-exist with bacteria but also are highly abundant. Here we describe the genomic content of phage particles released by 6 different strains in the starter culture. The identified prophages belong to three different subgroups of the Siphoviridae P335 phage group. Remarkably, most analysed prophages show disruptions in different tail encoding genes, explaining the common tailless phenotype. Furthermore, a number of potentially beneficial features for the host carried by prophages were identified. The prophages carry up to 3 different phage defence systems per genome that are potentially functional in protecting the host from foreign phage infection. We suggest that the presumably defective prophages are a result of bacteria-phage coevolution and could convey advantages to host bacteria. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Potential of novel cadaverine biosensor technology to predict shelf life of chilled yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares).		Food Control					A considerable amount of fresh fish is wasted, due to imprecise shelf life estimations that lead to relatively short use-by dates. This study aimed at evaluating a newly developed sensor measuring cadaverine headspace concentrations, as a rapid and precise measure to estimate within a realistic DK retail scenario freshness and shelf life of imported tuna loins. To achieve this the cadaverine concentration as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) in tuna steaks from different biological replicas undergoing storage at 2 °C, were associated to the freshness states and shelf life as determined by the Quality Index Method (QIM) and microbial measurements. The cadaverine sensor responses of tuna stored under the same conditions were compared to the validated LC-MS/MS concentrations and benchmarked towards the QIM and microbial counts estimation of shelf life. The results indicated that the novel cadaverine biosensor allowed an estimation of freshness and transition of acceptable to unacceptable quality of the tuna steaks comparable to other methods such as LC-MS/MS determination of cadaverin, QIM and determination of microbiological counts. The composition of the microbiological flora during storage, consisted mainly of Pseudomonas fragi but also other Pseudomonas spp, Vibrio spp., Brochothrix thermosphacta, H2S producing bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae, the latter only in relatively low numbers. The novel biosensor technology appear to be a promising rapid and cost efficient method for evaluating freshness of several types of fish products in addition to fresh tuna, which will support the sustainability of the fish industry.

Techno-functional properties of thermally treated black bean protein concentrate generated through ultrafiltration process.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work aimed to investigate the effect of thermal processing on black bean protein extraction yield and techno-functional properties. Dehulled black beans were processed through high temperature-pressure cooking (HTPC) (100 and 121 °C for 15 and 30 min) and extrusion (90,105, and 120 °C). Black bean proteins were extracted, concentrated by ultrafiltration and spray dried. Extraction yields and techno-functional properties were evaluated. Proteins were concentrated 2.84-3.50 fold times using 5 kDa membrane (p> 0.05). However, all the thermal treatments increase protein permeation 29-39% compared to the raw treatment (p< 0.05). The black bean protein concentrates emulsion capacity ranged from 556 to 971 g/g (pH 3.0-7.0). Nonetheless, all HTPC treatments and the extrusion treatment at 90 °C, enhanced 9.5-24.5% (p< 0.05) the emulsion capacity of black bean protein concentrates at pH 5.0. While 90 °C extrusion treatment improves emulsion capacity 13.6% at pH 7.0, compared to the raw treatment. The combination of extrusion or HTPC with 5 kDa membrane ultrafiltration process could be used to produce ready to use and high-quality black bean protein concentrates with high yields and improved techno-functional properties. Black bean protein concentrates could be and alternative ingredient for the food industry with enhanced techno-functional properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Physicochemical properties, sugar profile, and non-starch polysaccharides characterization of old wheat malt landraces.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Craft beers produced by small breweries are becoming increasingly popular worldwide due to their unique composition, taste, and flavour. Wheat malt is a traditional brewing raw material with great potential to improve beer properties such as mouthfeel, foam, haze, and flavour. In this study, the malting quality of eight wheat varieties (four common and four durum) was evaluated to explore the feasibility of producing 100% wheat malt beer from old landraces. The physicochemical characteristics such as friability, Kolbach index, viscosity, and colour, of the wheat malts indicated a better degree of modification in the common wheat varieties when compared to that of the durum wheat varieties. The wheat malts showed a proper enzymatic pattern, and significant differences in the enzyme activities were observed in durum and common wheat malts which affected the non-starch and starch polysaccharide content. The sugar content, profile, and extract levels of the congress worts were comparable to those of commercial malts. This study could be a useful resource that enables small brewing and malting to extend their product portfolio and promote the use of old landraces to produce beers with unique tastes and profiles.

European Food Research and Technology					Dietary polyphenols like epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-which represents the most abundant flavan-3-ol in green tea-are subject of several studies regarding their bioactivity and health-related properties. On many occasions, cell culture or in vitro experiments form the basis of published data. Although the stability of these compounds is observed to be low, many reported effects are directly related to the parent compounds whereas the impact of EGCG degradation and autoxidation products is not yet understood and merely studied. EGCG autoxidation products like its dimers theasinensin A and D, "P2" and oolongtheanin are yet to be characterized in the same extent as their parental polyphenol. However, to investigate the bioactivity of autoxidation products-which would minimize the discrepancy between in vitro and in vivo data-isolation and structure elucidation techniques are urgently needed. In this study, a new protocol to acquire the dimers theasinensin A and D as well as oolongtheanin is depicted, including a variety of spectroscopic and quadrupole time-of-flight high-resolution mass spectrometric (qTOF-HRMS) data to characterize and assign these isolates. Through nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, polarimetry, and especially circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy after enzymatic hydrolysis the complementary atropisomeric stereochemistry of the isolated theasinensins is illuminated and elucidated. Lastly, a direct comparison between the isolated EGCG autoxidation products and the monomer itself is carried out regarding their antioxidant properties featuring Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) values. These findings help to characterize these products regarding their cellular effects and-which is of special interest in the flavonoid group-their redox properties. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	247	12	2961	2975	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03846-3					FSTA:2022-03-Aj3434

Ecology of yeasts associated with kernels of several durum wheat genotypes and their role in co-culture with Saccharomyces cerevisiae during dough leavening.		Food Microbiology					This work was performed to investigate on the yeast ecology of durum wheat to evaluate the interaction between kernel yeasts and the commercial baker's yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during dough leavening. Yeast populations were studied in 39 genotypes of durum wheat cultivated in Sicily. The highest level of kernel yeasts was 2.9 Log CFU/g. A total of 413 isolates was collected and subjected to phenotypic and genotypic characterization. Twenty-three yeast species belonging to 11 genera have been identified. Filobasidium oeirense, Sporobolomyces roseus and Aureobasidium pullulans were the species most commonly found in durum wheat kernels. Doughs were co-inoculated with yeasts isolated from wheat kernels and commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in order to evaluate the interactions between yeasts and the leavening performance. Yeast populations of all doughs have been monitored as well as dough volume increase and weight loss (as CO2) measured after 2 h of fermentation. The doughs whose final volume was higher than control dough (inoculated exclusively with S. cerevisiae) were those inoculated with Naganishia albida, Vishniacozyma dimennae (118 mL each), and Candida parapsilosis (102 mL). The weight losses were variable, depending on the co-culture used with S. cerevisiae and the values were in the range of 0.08-1.00 g CO2/100 g. The kernel yeasts species C. parapsilosis, N. albida, P. terrestris, R. mucilaginosa and V. dimennae deserves future attention to be co-inoculated with the commercial starter S. cerevisiae in order to improve the sensory characteristics of bread.

Effects of different yeast strains, nutrients and glutathione-rich inactivated yeast addition on the aroma characteristics of Catarratto wines.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Catarratto is one of the most common non-aromatic white grape varieties cultivated in Sicily (Southern Italy). In order to improve the aromatic expression of Catarratto wines a trial was undertaken to investigate the effect of yeast strain, nutrition and reduced glutathione. Variables included two Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, an oenological strain (GR1) and one isolated from honey by-products (SPF52), three different nutrition regimes (Stimula Sauvignon Blanc (SS), Stimula Chardonnay (SC) and classic nutrition practice), and a specific inactivated yeast rich in reduced glutathione to prevent oxidative processes [Glutastar (GIY)] ensuing in ten treatments (T1-T10). Microbiological and chemical parameters demonstrated the aptitude of strain SPF52 to successfully conduct alcoholic fermentation. During fermentation, the Saccharomyces yeast populations ranged from 7 to 8 logarithmic CFU/mL. All wines had a final ethanol content ranging between 12.91 and 13.85% (v/v). The dominance of the two starter strains over native yeast populations was higher than 97% as estimated by interdelta analysis. The addition of nutrients SS or SC increased the aromatic complexity of the wines as reflected by volatile organic compounds (VOCs) composition and sensory profiles. In particular, 32 VOCs were identified; alcohols (62.46-81.1%), thiols (0.27-0.87%), ethers (0.09-0.16%), aldehydes (0-1.21%), ketones (0-2.28%), carboxylic acids (4.21-12.32%), esters (0-10.85%), lactones (0.9-1.49%) and other compounds (0.77-6.9%). Sensory analysis demonstrated a significant impact on wine aroma in relation to yeast starter strain used, the type of nutrition (SS, SC or classic nutrition) and the presence/absence of GIY. The wines produced with GR1 yeast strain and SS (T2), SPF52 with SC (T9) both in presence of GIY showed higher overall quality. Trials T2 and T9 showed the highest scores for 13 and 18 attributes, respectively. The different nutrition, addition of GIY and the yeast starter strains diversified and enhanced sensory expression of Catarratto wines.

A novel thermostable xylanase from Geobacillus vulcani GS90: production, biochemical characterization, and its comparative application in fruit juice enrichment.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Xylanases have great attention to act as a potential role in agro-industrial processes. In this study, production, characterization, and fruit juice application of novel xylanase from thermophilic Geobacillus vulcani GS90 (GvXyl) were performed. GvXyl was purified via acetone precipitation and gel-filtration chromatography. The results showed that GvXyl had 1,671.4 U/mg of specific activity and optimally worked at pH 8 and 55 °C. It was also active in a wide pH (3-9) and temperature (30-90°C) ranges. GvXyl was highly stable at 90°C and relatively stable at pH 3-9. The kinetic parameters of GvXyl were obtained as Km, Vmax, and kcat; 10.2 mg/ml, 4,104 mol min-1 mg-1, and 3,542.6 s-1, respectively. GvXyl had higher action than commercial xylanase in fruit juice enrichment. These results revealed that GvXyl might possess a potential influence in fruit juice processing because of its high specific activity and great thermal stability. Practical applications: Polysaccharides include starch, pectin, and hemicellulose create problems by lowering fruit juice quality in beverages. To overcome this problem, various clarification processes might be applied to natural fruit juices. Even though chemicals are widely used for this purpose, recently enzymes including xylanases are preferred for obtaining high-quality products. In this study, we reported the production and biochemical characterization of novel thermostable xylanase from thermophilic G. vulcani GS90 (GvXyl). Also, apple and orange juice enrichment were performed with the novel xylanase to increase the quality in terms of yield, clarity, and reducing sugar substance. The improved quality features of apple and orange juices with GvXyl was then compared to commercially available beta-1,4-xylanase. The results revealed that GvXyl might possess a potential influence in fruit juice processing because of its high specific activity and great thermal stability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Algboory, H. L.; Muhialdin, B. J.							Novel peptides contribute to the antimicrobial activity of camel milk fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum IS10.		Food Control					Fermented camel milk is a good source of peptides including novel peptides produced by the starter culture. This study aimed to determine the novel peptides that contribute to the antimicrobial activity of fermented camel milk. Camel milk was pasteurized at 90 °C for 30 min and fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum IS10 for 24 h at 42 °C. The water-soluble extract was subjected to RP-HPLC fractionation and LC-MS/MS in combination with PEAKS STDIO software to identify the novel peptides via de novo sequencing. The antimicrobial activity was determined using a 96-well microtiter plate assay, showing a significant decline in pH from 6.6 at 0 h to 4.1 at 24 h with an increasing L. plantarum cell count from Log10 5.5 CFU mL-1 at 0 h to Log10 7.4 CFU mL-1 at 24 h. Twenty-one fractions were obtained by RP-HPLC, with fraction 14 demonstrating the highest antibacterial activity towards Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus. Fraction 14 contained 30 novel peptides with a molecular weight ranging from 598 to 2053 Da, with seven peptides showing more than 50% similarity to antimicrobial peptides contained in the database. The seven novel peptides inhibited the growth of E. coli and S. aureus subsp. aureus, contributing to the antimicrobial activity of fermented camel milk. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the preharvest application of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on postharvest dissipation of stress watercore incidence and severity rating over 30 d at 20°C. "Jonagold" trees were untreated or sprayed with 1-MCP one week before harvest. Harvest indices and quality factors at 20°C, were assessed on days 2, 5, 9, 15, 20, and 30. Fruit treated with preharvest 1-MCP treatment had lower internal ethylene concentrations and lower starch pattern indices (higher starch concentration) at harvest compared with untreated fruit, but no effects on flesh firmness, soluble solids concentration, titratable acidity, watercore incidence and severity rating, and soluble sugars were detected. At 20°C, however, preharvest 1-MCP treated fruit had a faster decrease of stress water core incidence and severity than untreated fruit, and delayed development of senescent breakdown and skin shriveling. Sorbitol concentrations were lower in preharvest 1-MCP treated fruit than untreated fruit, but effects on glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch concentrations were not consistent. More rapid loss of stress-associated water core in preharvest 1-MCP treated fruit was consistent with lower sorbitol concentrations in the cortical tissues.

J		Alhaji, N. B.; Maikai, B. V.; Kwaga, J. K. P.							Antimicrobial use, residue and resistance dissemination in freshwater fish farms of north-central Nigeria: one health implications.		Food Control					A structured questionnaire was administered to 151 purposively selected fish farmers to assess their practices and perceptions on antimicrobial usage (AMU) in fresh water fish farms in North-central Nigeria. Risk pathways for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) spread, risk status and drivers for misuse and overuse of antimicrobials were also assessed and residue presence in fish and pond water samples determined. Descriptive and analytic statistical analyses were performed at 95% confidence level. AMU risk status was assessed with Traffic Light model. Disc diffusion test was used to detect residues. All 151 recruited farmers participated but only 78.1% of them used antimicrobials in fish production. About 94% farmers practiced self-prescription of antimicrobials, and 94.9% did not observe withdrawal periods after AMU. AMR risk pathways were consumption (p=0.010), contacts (p=0.004), and environment (p=0.002). Socio-cultural drivers of antimicrobial misuse, overuse and resistance emergence in fish farms were inappropriate AMU (p=0.002), poor biosecurity (p=0.001), poor sanitation (p=0.001), poor economic status of farmers (p=0.002), and intensive management system (p=0.001). Majority (73.5%) of farms were in Class 3 (Red risk) status. Residues were detected in fish and water samples from 44.4% of the farms. The study revealed poor practices and perceptions on AMU. AMU stewardship should be promoted through farmers' education. To achieve food safety, food security, public and environmental health, socio-cultural drivers for misuse and overuse in farms should be mitigated through surveillance and control programmes using the concept of "One Health" approach.

Physicochemical, microbiological, and sensorial quality attributes of a fermented milk drink (laban) fortified with date syrup (Dibs) during cold storage.		Foods					This study investigated the nutritional, microbial, and sensory quality attributes of a fermented milk (laban) drink flavored with date syrup (dibs) during cold storage at 4°C for 7 days. Date syrup was added to laban in specific proportions (2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15% date syrup/total weight of flavored laban) and an appropriate percentage (12.5%, 74 °Bx) was selected based on the sensory preference of panelists. The results indicate that flavoring laban with date syrup affected the physicochemical, nutritional, microbial, and sensory quality attributes of the product in different ways. Incorporation of date syrup in fresh laban drink significantly increased the pH, ash, protein, total solids, sugars, and magnesium (p< 0.05). However, acidity, fat, casein, lactose, calcium, total microbial count, and total yeast and molds count were decreased (p< 0.05). During storage, acidity, ash, and microbial load were concomitantly increased, while fat, casein, total solids, and sugars showed a concurrent reduction as the storage period progressed. The panelists preferred the freshly prepared flavored laban drink compared with the stored one, which is not surprising. After 7 days of storage, flavored laban drink was more acceptable than a non-flavored one. The findings of this research will help in fortifying dairy products with dates to create highly nutritious drinks without the addition of artificial additives, refined sweeteners, and preservatives, which at the same time would be accepted by consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

Composition of canola seed sprouts fermented by Aureobasidium pullulans, Neurospora crassa, and Trichoderma reesei under submerged-state fermentation.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Seed sprouts are nutrient-rich components, and their use in human and animal diets have increased in recent times. Microbial fermentation of seed sprouts not only improves the nutrient digestibility but also elevates the nutritional characteristics by lowering the level of antinutritional factors (ANFs). This study evaluates the effect of sprouting followed by fungal fermentation on the nutritional characteristics of canola seed sprouts. Canola seeds were soaked overnight and sprouted over a 6-day period. Dried and ground seed sprouts were subjected to submerged fermentation for 5 days using three fungal strains (Aureobasidium pullulans, Trichoderma reesei, Neurospora crassa). Results showed an improvement in proteins and reduction in ANFs of sprouts when compared to seeds. Fermentation with T. reeseiresulted in higher protein titers, whileN. crassa fermented sprouts exhibited slight reduction in crude fiber. Sprouting prior to fermentation helped in enhancing the protein solubility of canola seed and reducing the overall fermentation duration. Based on these findings it could be concluded that sprouting prior to fermentation can potentially lead to the production of nutritionally enriched canola based high protein ingredient. However, further research needs to be conducted to develop a mechanism for minimizing the oil loss during seed sprouting process. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effect of ultrasonic treatments on the properties and stability of the water-in-oil (W/O) emulsion of Pulicaria jaubertii (PJ) extract. The study used different ultrasound powers (0, 100, 200, 400, and 600 W) at two storage degrees (4 and 25 °C) for 28 days. The findings showed that the emulsifying properties were improved to different extents after ultrasonic treatments. The treatment at 600 W showed optimum particle size, polydispersity index, emulsifying property, viscosity properties, and release of total phenolic content than the other powers. However, the ultrasonic power of 400 W gave positive effects on creaming index and antioxidant release compared to 600 W. The emulsion stored at 4 °C presented higher stability than that stored at 25 °C during the 28 days of storage. Microscopically, the increase in sonication power up to 600 W reduced particle size and decreased flocculation, thus resulted in stable emulsions, which is desirable for its applications in food systems.

J		Ali Al-Maqtari, Q.; Ali Mahdi, A.; Waleed Al-Nsi; Khaleel Mohammed, J.; Minping Wei; Weirong Yao							Evaluation of bioactive compounds and antibacterial activity of Pulicaria jaubertii extract obtained by supercritical and conventional methods.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Pulicaria jaubertii (PJ) is a fragrant herb traditionally used in medication and as a food seasoning. To date, there are no studies on the use of supercritical fluids extraction with carbon dioxide (SFE-CO2) on PJ. This study evaluates and compares the Total phenolic contents (TPC), antioxidant activity by DPPH. , antioxidant capacity by ABTS.+, and antibacterial activities of the PJ extract. Extraction was done by using two different methods namely, SFE-CO2 with 10% ethanol (EtOH) as a co-solvent and conventional extraction by Shaking (Sh) with two solvents (EtOH and water) with different concentrations (100,70, 50,30 and 0% v/v). The highest extraction yield and antioxidant capacity were obtained by Sh-EtOH 50% [13.9% and 91.24 Trolox equivalents per g dry extract (mg TE/g DE)] respectively. The extract obtained by Sh-EtOH 70% represented the highest TPC and antioxidant inhibition values (899.02 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE) /g DE and 76.93%) respectively. The SFE-CO2 extract has significantly greater antimicrobial activity and is more effective against Gram-positive bacteria. The most sensitive Bacterium was B. subtilis, while the most resistant Bacterium was P. aeruginosa. The optimum values of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) against B. subtilis were noticed in SFE-CO2 extract (0.4 mg/ml) for both. Overall, the results of this study indicated that PJ is a good source of TPC, antioxidants, and antibacterial compounds. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	449	456	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00652-5					FSTA:2021-06-Te2014
J		Ali Alehosseini; Prateek Sharma; Kelly, A. L.; Jeremiah J. Sheehan							Characterization of norbixin and evaluation of its mobility through rennet-induced micellar casein concentrate gels as influenced by an electrical field.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					In this study, application of an electrical field to facilitate the migration of norbixin molecules through rennet-induced micellar casein concentrate (MCC) and agar gels was evaluated. To determine the effect of selected parameters on norbixin penetration through the renneted casein gels, MCC, as a curd-like structure, was used to simplify the study of the process and evaluate the impact of each parameter on the migration of norbixin molecules separately. The physicochemical properties of norbixin solutions were characterized, followed by evaluation of the effects of changing gel composition on colorant mobility-influenced by an electrical field. Multi-angle dynamic light scattering enabled size measurement of norbixin solutions. A strong negative charge (-53.4 to -73.4 mV) was observed at all pH values examined. Localization of norbixin molecules within the aqueous phase was shown by confocal laser scanning microscopy. Norbixin solutions, characterized by LUMiSizer and light microscopy, showed the formation of aggregates (30-50 mum) in the presence of CaC12. Reducing pH and increasing calcium content considerably decreased norbixin penetration through the gels. The penetration rate of norbixin was considerably reduced (~ 60%) in the presence of 2% of calcium chloride. By reducing the pH from 6.58 to 5.37 and 6.60 to 5.30, the penetration rate of color through the gels containing 7.5 and 15% protein was reduced by ~90 and 80%, respectively. However, as salt concentrations increased (0% to 4%), the penetration rate of the colorant through MCC gels of 15% protein increased by 60%. Overall, this work shows that applying an electrical field is a promising approach which may considerably increase the migration rate of colorant through rennet-induced casein gels.

J		Ali Bagherian; Bostan Roudi; Nahid Masoudian; Hamed Mirzaei							Anti-glioblastoma effects of nanomicelle-curcumin plus erlotinib.		Food & Function					Glioblastoma (GBM), one of the most significant brain neoplasms, is characterized by high metastasis and recurrence. Crossing the blood-brain barrier is one of the main therapeutic obstacles, seriously hampering therapeutic agents entering the brain. This research investigated the co-delivery of erlotinib and curcumin via nanomicelles for enhancing anti-GBM treatment in vitro. For this purpose, curcumin and nanomicelle-curcumin (50 muM) were investigated alone and also with erlotinib (50 muM) in U87 glioblastoma cells. The cell viability of U87 cells after exposure to curcumin/nanomicelle curcumin/erlotinib and their combinations was measured by CCK-8 assay. The expression of the Wnt signaling-related genes was measured by qRT-PCR assay. The altered expression of NF-kB and proteins associated with angiogenesis, apoptosis, and autophagy were investigated by western blot assay. Compared with the control, all treatments reduced the viability of U87 glioblastoma cells. Furthermore, the level of proteins related to angiogenesis and Wnt pathway-associated genes in the nanomicelle-curcumin + erlotinib group were significantly decreased compared to the curcumin, erlotinib, and control groups. Each treatment regulated autophagy and apoptosis-associated proteins. Total phospho-NF-kappaB (p65) and total NF-kappaB (p65) declined in each treatment at the protein levels. Overall, nanomicelle-curcumin alone or combined with erlotinib showed anti-GBM activity in the U87 cell line by regulating the signaling pathways in GBM pathogenesis and thus may be a promising nanodrug candidate for application in the field of GBM therapy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	21	10926	10937	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01611c					FSTA:2022-03-Aj3456

Prevalence and molecular characterization of multidrug-resistant and beta-lactamase producing Salmonella enterica serovars isolated from duck, pigeon, and quail carcasses in Mansoura, Egypt.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					To date no available data concerning the prevalence and characterization of Salmonella spp. In duck, pigeon, and quail carcasses in Egypt or even in Africa. This study was therefore undertaken to determine the prevalence, serotypes, antibiotic resistance profiles, virulence genes, and beta-lactamase genes of Salmonella isolates from duck, pigeon, and quail carcasses marketed in Mansoura, Egypt. Salmonella spp. Were detected in 62%, 40%, and 46% of duck, pigeon, and quail carcasses, respectively, with an overall prevalence of 49.3% (148/300). Salmonella marker gene; invA was detected in all of the 158 isolates, while the other virulence genes; hilA, stn, and spvC were detected in 91.8%, 65.8%, and 22.8%, respectively. S. Typhimurium, S. Kentucky, and S. Enteritidis were the most prevalent serotypes. Among the Salmonella isolates identified, 5.1%, 16.5%, and 75.9% were classified as pan-drug resistant (PDR), extensively-drug resistant (XDR), and multidrug resistant (MDR), respectively. beta-lactamase resistance genes detected in 10 (13.2%) out of the 76 ampicillin-resistant Salmonella isolates. blaCMY-1 was the most identified beta-lactamase gene (n=8), followed by blaOXA-2 (n=5) and blaCMY-2 (n=1). Our findings demonstrated a widespread contamination of poultry carcasses by MDR Salmonella, which constitutes a significant public health issue due to the potential of their transmission to humans via food chain.

J		Ali, F.; Houde, J.; Charron, C.; Sadiki, M.							Chemical composition and properties of maple sap treated with an ultra high membrane concentration process.		Food Control					Nanofiltration and Reverse Osmosis are membrane concentration processes originally used by maple syrup producers to preconcentrate the sap to a moderate °Brix level (8-16 °Brix). The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of new membrane technology to concentrate maple sap to ultra-high °Brix and to investigate the effect of this concentration on the chemical composition and physical properties of final sap concentrate. Maple sap was concentrated up to 42 °Brix using two industrial membrane units. The contents of main solutes increased with the °Brix of concentrates depending on the specific rejection rate of the membranes tested. A slight and significant decrease was observed in the availability of some solutes such as K+, Mn++ and polyphenols in ultra-high-concentrated sap. However, the apparent organoleptic and physical properties of these concentrates have not been altered. According to the results of this, the new membrane process allows to produce ultra-high °Brix concentrate of maple sap with interesting properties. However, further works have to be performed on this technology to more precisely determine the highest °Brix level that will minimise the affect on chemical composition and properties of concentrated sap and the corresponding maple syrup.

J		Ali Farajzadeh, M.; Alireza Pirmohamadlou; Sattari Dabbagh, M.							Extraction and preconcentration of some pesticides in vegetable and fruit juice samples using SA@CaCO3 sorbent combined with dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction.		Food Analytical Methods					An efficient sample preparation method, dispersive solid-phase microextraction-dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction, coupled to gas chromatography-flame ionization detector was developed for the extraction, preconcentration, and determination of six pesticides (ametryn, penconazole, oxadiazon, diniconazole, tebuconazole, and fenoxaprop-P-ethyl) in vegetable and fruit juice samples. In this study, stearic acid-coated calcium carbonate is utilized as the sorbent. This sorbent is industrially available, and there is no need for a time-consuming synthesis procedure. The influence of several effective parameters on the extraction efficiency, including sorbent amount, salt addition, pH, adsorption and desorption time, type and volume of elution solvent, type and volume of extraction solvent, and time and speed of centrifugation, was assessed. The proposed procedure represented satisfactory values for the extraction recoveries and enrichment factors under optimal extraction conditions in the ranges of 52-93% and 260-465, respectively. Satisfactory precisions with relative standard deviation values of 1.74-4.96% (intra-day, n = 6) and 2.68-6.78% (inter-day, n = 4) were achieved at a concentration of 50 mug L-1 of each pesticide. Additionally, low limits of detection and quantification in the ranges of 0.20-0.85 and 0.67-2.83 mug L-1, respectively, were obtained. The procedure was applied to seven fruit and vegetable juice samples, and good relative recoveries between 82 and 103% were obtained. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	11	2395	2407	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02068-3					FSTA:2022-02-Hq1373

Colorimetric and fluorometric nanoprobe for selective and sensitive recognition of hazardous colorant indigo carmine in beverages based on ion pairing with nitrogen doped carbon dots.		Food Chemistry					Indigo carmine (IC) dye is hazardous and allergenic for humans even though it has been excessively used in a wide range of industries. Therefore, the quantitative determination of IC is still challenging. Herein, for the first time, we have developed fluorometric and colorimetric dual-mode nanoprobe derived from the ion-pair association complex between the negatively charged IC and positively charged N@C-dots in pH=3.0. Consequently, the binding between N@C-dots and IC resulted in cyan blue and quenching of N@C-dots fluorescence. The dependence of the fluorescence response on IC concentrations was linear over the range of 0.73-10.0 M (R2=0.9989) with LOD of 0.24 M. On the other hand, the linearity of the colorimetric method ranged from 9.97 to 80.0 M (R2=0.9986) with LOD of 3.3 M. The sensor was applied for estimation of IC in fruit juice and soft drink without the need for exhaustive extraction steps. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ali Heydari; Ali Razavi, S. M.; Asgar Farahnaky							Effect of high pressure-treated wheat starch as a fat replacer on the physical and rheological properties of reduced-fat O/W emulsions.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					In the current research, the impact of high hydrostatic pressure-treated wheat starch (HPWS) at different concentrations (10%, 15%, and 20% w/w), as a fat replacer, on the physical, textural and rheological characteristics and stability of model reduced-fat emulsions (25%, 50%, and 75% fat reduction) was examined. Replacing a higher concentration of HPWS augmented the magnitude of zeta potential and decreased the Z-average droplet size and PDI values of the prepared samples, but increasing the fat reduction level (FR) revealed a reverse trend. The rheological analysis showed that HPWS caused an increase in G'value of the emulsions rather than the control ones, and G' increased significantly with increasing HPWS concentration, and tan delta decreased evidently, which depicts more solid-like behavior of prepared emulsions. Given results indicated that HPWS by creating comparable spreadability, consistency, elasticity, and yield stress, as well as good stability of the reduced-fat emulsions, can be suggested as a promising fat replacer.

A novel process to improve the characteristics of low-fat ice cream using date fiber powder.		Food Science & Nutrition					The objective of this study was to improve the characteristics of low-fat ice cream (LFIC) using date fiber powder (DFP). DFP was added to LFIC mix (3% fat, 14% milk solids nonfat, 15% sucrose, 0.3% stabilizer, and 0.1% vanilla) at a rate of 1.5%, 2.5%, and 3.5%. Control treatment with no DFP was also manufactured for comparison. The LFIC mix was analyzed for physicochemical and microbiological analyses. After manufacture, microbiological, rheological, and sensory characteristics of LFIC were evaluated during storage at -18°C for 30 days. The addition of DFP to the LFIC mix led to increasing (p<.05) the density and weight per gallon (lb) of final product. Thus, a 3.5% of DFP led to increasing the density of LFIC from 0.6 to 1.0 g/cm3 and weight per gallon from 5.2 to 9.0 lb, while the overrun of LFIC was decreased (p<.05) from 50.0% to 24.0%. Additionally, the melting resistance of LFIC made with DFP was higher (p<.05) as compared to control. Approximately 60% of LFIC made with DFP was melted after 50 min compared to 100% in control. The total bacterial count (TBC) and yeast and molds' count slightly increased in LFIC with adding DFP. However, there was a slight decrease in these counts during storage for 30 days. Psychrotrophic and coliform bacteria were not detected in the LFIC. Organoleptically, LFIC made with DFP showed higher scores (p<.05) of body and texture, melting quality, and appearance as compared to control during the 30 days of storage. However, the flavor was slightly decreased (p< .05) as the concentration of DFP was increased. The overall scores were increased with increasing the DFP concentrations up to 15 days as compared to control, followed by a decrease at 30 days of storage. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Mint and ginger are rich sources of phenolic compounds, and thus the present study aimed to assess the impact of different extraction techniques on their polyphenolic yield and antioxidant activity, and to develop a ginger-mint drink. Conventional, ultrasonic and supercritical fluid extraction techniques were used, and ethanol, methanol and distilled water selected as extraction solvents for mint and ginger. Antioxidant activity was determined by beta-carotene bleaching inhibition, DPPH and FRAP assays. Total phenolics (TPC) and flavonoids contents were also quantified, and physicochemical and sensory characteristics of the ginger-mint drink assessed. The results elucidated higher TPC, beta-carotene bleaching inhibition, DPPH, FRAP and total flavonoids of mint and ginger in supercritical on 30 min as 2481.6 245 and 2441 240, 74 7.1 and 69 6.1, 79 7.1 and 74 6.1, 17.21 1.3 and 16.4 1.5, and 35 2.8 and 34 2.9, respectively, followed by ultrasonic assisted extraction. Likewise, the functional drink prepared from these extracts exhibited promising physicochemical, sensorial and antioxidant traits. In conclusion, supercritical fluid extraction was the best method for maximum and accurate extraction with ethanol revealing to be the best solvent for this process, with higher yields, when compared to methanol and distilled water. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Ali Issazadeh, S.; Samaneh Hatami; Masoud Yavarmanesh							In vitro investigation of chemical composition and antibacterial activity of alcoholic, hydroalcoholic extracts, and essential oil of Spinacia oleracea leaves from Iran.		Journal of Food Safety					This study is to investigate the antibacterial activity of the alcoholic and hydroalcoholic extracts of Spinacia oleracea leaves, on Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 7644), Salmonella enteritidis (ATCC 13076), Escherichia coli O157:H7 (NCTC 12900) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 15442), and to identify bioactive functional components including essential oil by GC-MS. Microbial analyses, including disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were conducted, whose results were compared with some specific antibiotics. The results of the MIC and MBC analyses indicated that S. enteritidis and L. monocytogenes were more sensitive to the alcoholic extract than P. aeruginosa and E. coli. However, the hydroalcoholic extract showed no MIC and MBC for the tested pathogens. In the disc diffusion method, the alcoholic extract had a great effect on L. monocytogenes. The GC-MS analysis showed phenolic compounds (9.345%), unsaturated and saturated fatty acids (22.901%), alkaloids, and terpenes (58.57%), amino acids (6.279%), squalene (0.233%), and other compounds in the alcoholic extract of Spinach, which has functional roles in biological activities. Furthermore, the most important compounds of the essential oil of the Iranian spinach were durohydroquinone (34.73%), alpha-terpineol (12.98%), linalool (22.69%), and cineole (13.1%). According to the results, the alcoholic extract and the essential oil of S. oleracea leaves can be a good alternative for antibiotics and can be used in foods and animal feed as a preservative. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	3			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12891					FSTA:2021-10-Cd2930

J		Ali Khadivi; Farhad Mirheidari; Younes Moradi; Simin Paryan							Identification of superior jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) genotypes based on morphological and fruit characterizations.		Food Science & Nutrition					Jujube (Ziziphus jujuba Mill.) is of great importance due to its medicinal properties and nutritional value. The current investigation was carried out to assess phenotypic variation of naturally grown accessions of this species. The accessions investigated exhibited meaningful variabilities based on the recorded characters. Fruit fresh weight ranged from 0.36 to 3.83 g with an average of 1.16, fruit dry weight varied from 0.21 to 3.04 g with an average of 0.80, and fruit flesh thickness varied from 1.24 to 8.51 mm. Skin color showed large variabilities among the accessions, including maroon-yellow, light maroon, maroon, dark maroon, light brown, brown, dark brown, and maroon-crimson. Principal component analysis (PCA) determined the characters influencing the most variation among the accessions. Cluster analysis performed with the Euclidean distance and Ward's method divided the accessions into two main clusters. The present findings provided essential data about the morphological traits of Z. jujube that can be used for the selection of superior genotypes and development of the fruit processing industry. Besides, the available results can be useful in designing conservation strategies and breeding of Z. jujube. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Ali Khadivi; Marzieh Arab							Identification of the superior genotypes of pomegranate (Punicagranatum L.) using morphological and fruit characters.		Food Science & Nutrition					Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) fruits can be used for fresh consumption, industrial processing, and medicinal purposes. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the diversity of its different genotypes to be aware of their potential. In the present study, morphological and pomological diversity of 70 native pomegranate genotypes was evaluated to introduce superior selections. Most of the characters showed significant differences among the genotypes. Fruit weight ranged from 103.28 to 407.59 g, and total aril weight per fruit ranged from 51.55 to 238.97 g. Fruit peel color was highly variable and included yellow, yellow-red, red, and red-brown. The sunburn and cracking disorders were not observed on the peel of the majority of genotypes. Aril color was highly variable, including light milky, pink, white-red, red, and red-black. Seed was soft in 17, semi-soft in 21, and hard in 32 genotypes. Total aril weight per fruit was positively and significantly correlated with fruit length (r=0.64), fruit diameter (r=0.87), fruit weight (r=0.95), fruit stalk diameter (r=0.52), fruit peel weight (r=0.71), and aril shape (r=0.32). Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the fruit-related traits were important for determining differences between genotypes. Based on the ideal values of commercial characters of pomegranate, 15 genotypes were promising and thus could be directly cultivated in the orchards and used in the breeding programs. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Bioscience					This study aimed to enhance the antioxidant activity, antifungal activity, and oxidation stability of Citrus reticulata essential oil (EO) nanocapsules by using cinnamon EO and clove EO. The encapsulation efficiency, moisture content, water activity, particle properties, glass transition temperatures, relative crystallinity, and chemical structure were analyzed. Results showed that all formulas have stable moisture levels (less than 6%), water activity (less than 0.6), and an encapsulation efficiency higher than 91%, which were confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results. Compared with C. reticulata EO (CEO), the addition of cinnamon EO and clove EO increased the total phenolic content by 1.75 and 1.54 times, respectively. The results indicated that the addition of cinnamon EO and clove EO increased the antioxidant activity by 3.57 and 2.08 times, as well as increased the antioxidant capacity by 4.43 and 3.52 times, respectively. The antifungal efficacy of CEO nanocapsules was enhanced by 3.13, 1.24, 2.76, and 2.97 times, and by 2.43, 1.24, 1.32, and 2.09 times against Candida albicans, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, Aspergillus niger, and Penicillium roqueforti by the addition of cinnamon EO and clove EO, respectively. Furthermore, the peroxide values were reduced by 16.88% and 15.58% with the addition of cinnamon EO and clove EO. These results indicated that C. reticulata oil nanocapsules' properties could be improved by adding cinnamon EO and clove EO to enhance the use of CEO.

J		Ali Mohebbi; Ali Farajzadeh, M.; Afshar Mogaddam, M. R.; Mahboob Nemati							Development of a stirring-dependent magnetic dispersive solid phase extraction method coupled with ferrofluid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction for the extraction of some pyrethroid pesticides from fruit juices.		Food Analytical Methods					In the present work, a new and efficient sample treatment method based on the combination of stirring-dependent magnetic dispersive solid phase microextraction and ferrofluid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction has been developed for the extraction of some pyrethroid pesticides (bifenthrin, phenothrin, tetramethrin, cyhalothrin, permethrin, and cypermethrin) from fruit juices prior to their determination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. For this purpose, a few milligrams of a synthesized magnetic sorbent (Fe3O4@ polythiophene) is added into a sample solution containing the analytes and stirred at high rate. By this action, particles of the magnetic sorbent are detached from the magnetic stir bar surface and completely dispersed throughout the solution. After stopping stirring, the particles containing the adsorbed analytes are rapidly returned onto the stir bar. Then, the stir bar is taken and eluted with an appropriate solvent to desorb the analytes. Afterward, the eluent is mixed with a few microliters of a synthesized ferrofluid and the mixture is rapidly injected into deionized water placed in a conical glass test tube for more enrichment of the analytes. In the next step, the ferrofluid settled down at the bottom of the tube in the presence of an external magnet and the supernatant is discarded. After back-extraction of the analytes with n-hexane, an aliquot of the extract is injected into the determination system. Under optimal conditions, the developed method offered high enrichment factors (1380-1660) and extraction recoveries (69-83%), and low limits of detection (4.0-12 ng L-1) and quantification (14-40 ng L-1). The relative standard deviations were ≤7.1% for intra-day (n=6) and inter-day (n=4) precisions at a concentration of 250 ng L-1 of each analyte. Finally, six different fruit juice samples were successfully analyzed by the introduced method and cypermethrin was detected in apple juice at a concentration of 1100.5 ng L-1. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	6	1216	1226	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-020-01918-w					FSTA:2021-11-Hq10225
J		Ali Osman; Ali Salama; Emam Mahmoud, K.; Mahmoud Sitohy							Alleviation of carbon tetrachloride-induced hepatocellular damage and oxidative stress in rats by Anabaena oryzae phycocyanin.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Phycocyanin isolated from Anabaena biomass was in-vitro assayed for its antioxidant activity against DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) and ABTS [2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)] free radical, revealing maximum activities amounting to 77 and 80% at 1,000 g/ml and SC50 values about 96 and 111 g/ml, respectively. A biological experiment was conducted, involving 40 male Wistar Albino rats, divided into five groups. Group I received only the basal diet as a normal control, while groups II, III, IV, and V were administrated intraperitoneal (IP) injection of a single dose of CCl4 (50% in corn oil) at 0.5 ml/kg body weight. Subsequently, groups II, III, IV, and V received phycocyanin at 0.0, 25, 50, and 100 mg/kg body weight/day. CCl4 induced considerable increases (p <.05) in the levels of serum ALT, AST, urea and creatinine, total lipid, and triglycerides coupled with significant reductions (p <.05) in serum antioxidant enzymes and some liver histopathological deformations compared to the negative control (group 1). Administration of Anabaena oryzaephycocyanin can counteract these CCl4-induced changes. Practical applications. Phycocyanin isolated from Anabaena has beneficial effects such as the antioxidant, antibacterial, anticancer, and hepatoprotective effect. Phycocyanin may play a key role in alleviating oxidative stress, artificially induced by carbon tetrachloride in Albino rats, to ultimately determine its capacity to serve as a natural antioxidant for food and health applications. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13562					FSTA:2021-05-Ad8108

H. M.							Antiproliferative and antioxidant potentials of bioactive edible vegetable fraction of Achyranthes ferruginea Roxb. in cancer cell line.		Food Science & Nutrition					In the present study, the aerial parts of Achyranthes ferruginea underwent investigation of their in vitro antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities in cell-free conditions, their phytoconstituents using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and their cytotoxic activity in HeLa cells. A. ferruginea was extracted with 80% methanol and successively fractionated with solvents to yield petroleum ether (PEF), chloroform (CHF), ethyl acetate (EAF), and aqueous (AQF) fractions. GC-MS analysis revealed that CHF contained ten phytoconstituents, including different forms of octadecanoic acid methyl esters. The total antioxidant and ferric-reducing antioxidant capacities of the extracts and the standard catechin (CA) were as follows: CA >CHF >PEF >CME (crude methanolic extract) >EAF >AQF, and CA >CHF >EAF >PEF >AQF >CME, respectively. CHF showed the highest DPPH-free radical-scavenging activity, with a median inhibitory concentration of 10.5 0.28g/ml, which was slightly higher than that of the standard butylated hydroxytoluene (12.0 0.09g/ml). In the hydroxyl radical-scavenging assay, CHF showed identical scavenging activity (9.25 0.73g/ml) when compared to CA (10.50 1.06g/ml). Moreover, CHF showed strong cytotoxic activity (19.95 1.18g/ml) in HeLa cells, which was alike to that of the standards vincristine sulfate and 5-fluorouracil (15.84 1.64g/ml and 12.59 1.75g/ml, respectively). The in silico study revealed that identified compounds were significantly linked to the targets of various cancer cells and oxidative enzymes. However, online prediction by SwissADME, admetSAR, and PASS showed that it has drug-like, nontoxic, and potential pharmacological actions. © 2021 The Authors.

Food Control					The presence of foreign materials in a batch of cocoa beans affect its profitability, marketability and overall quality grade of the product. Therefore, the identification of these materials and their subsequent removal is very important to ensure the high quality of the final product. This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging technology for the detection and discrimination of four categories of foreign materials (wood, plastic, stone and plant organs) that are relevant to the cocoa processing industries. The spectral image data of 250 cocoa beans and foreign material was analyzed using principal component analysis and three classification models Support Vector Machine (SVM) Linear Discriminant Analyses (LDA) and K Nearest Neighbours (KNN). Optimal wavebands, which were obtained from the second spectra graph and the first three PCs, were fed into the classification models and the performance of classifiers was compared. The results showed that SVM could reach over 89.10% accuracy in classifying cocoa beans and foreign materials. The accuracy of the SVM classifier when using optimal features as input was 86.90% for the training set and 81.28% for the test set. An external test set of data was used to test the generalization of the model. The results showed that the classification of foreign materials could be more robust when the optimal feature was used as input data.

J		Ali Sher, A.; Adnan Ashraf, M.; Mustafa, B. E.; Mohsin Raza, M.							Epidemiological trends of foodborne Campylobacter outbreaks in the United States of America, 1998-2016.		Food Microbiology					Campylobacter is a major cause of foodborne diarrheal infections in the United States of America (USA). This study aimed to elucidate the patterns of Campylobacter foodborne outbreaks temporally and spatially concerning food vehicles. We collected the data of foodborne outbreaks from 1998 to 2016 reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The incidence rate of outbreaks for each food source was calculated and analyzed for each variable including season, food location, and census region. Overall, 465 single-state outbreaks and 8003 cases were reported during 1998-2016. Outbreaks were frequently attributed to dairy products (32%), chicken (17%) and vegetables (6%). Binomial regression analysis showed that compared to chicken items, the highest rate ratio of outbreaks was associated with dairy products (1.86) followed by vegetables (1.35) and meat products (0.76). More outbreaks were reported in the summer (35%) followed by the spring (26%) and fall (22%) season. We found that the highest number of outbreaks occurred in the West 159 (34%) and Midwest 137 (29%) census regions. The study highlights the role of dairy, chicken, and vegetables as food vehicles in Campylobacter outbreaks. Findings from this study can help in devising strategies to mitigate the increasing occurrence of Campylobacter foodborne outbreaks.

Maillard reaction products and phenolic compounds from roasted peanut flour extracts prevent scopolamine-induced amnesia via cholinergic modulation and antioxidative effects in mice.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Research on the beneficial effects of Maillard reaction products (MRPs) and phenolic compounds derived from roasted peanut flour on the nervous system remains insufficient. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a 28-day oral administration of defatted peanut extract rich in MPRs and polyphenolic compounds on the cognitive impairments and oxidative injury induced by scopolamine in a mouse model. Light and dark extracts from peanut flour were prepared by heating peanuts at 187 °C for two different times (8.6 and 12.7 min) and defatted using soxhlet apparatus. The mice were orally pretreated with either roasted defatted peanuts extracts (100 mg/kg) or donepezil (3 mg/kg) for 21 days. On day 19 and until day 28, mice were injected subcutaneously with water or scopolamine (1 mg/kg body weight) 15 min after roasted defatted peanuts extracts/water feeding. Mice were subsequently subjected to a battery of behavioral tests including open field locomotor activity assay, and Morris water maze test. Brain tissues were collected to measure acetylcholine, acetylcholinesterase, and oxidative parameters (glutathione and malondialdehyde). Roasted defatted peanuts (light and dark) (100 mg/kg) treatment significantly ameliorated cognitive performance and reversed the oxidative damage when compared with the scopolamine group. These data demonstrate the defatted peanuts extracts exert potent anti-amnesic effects via the modulation of cholinergic and antioxidant activities.										2021	24	6	645	652	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.0028					FSTA:2022-01-Js0817
J		Ali Syed, S.; Al-Qahtani, A.; Mohammed S. Aldughaim; Ahmed Bari; Mohsin Kazi							Comparative analysis of metal ions and texture of ajwa seed powder using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry.		Food Analytical Methods					Minerals such as calcium, magnesium, and potassium which are available in the Ajwa dates are known to play vital roles in the regulation of blood pressure due to their interaction with the arterial resistance. The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of various ions in these date seeds and their correlation to the cardiovascular parameters. The powder was subjected to the electron microscope scanning to investigate the texture. Samples were prepared by microwave digestion using suprapur nitric acid 65% and 30% hydrogen peroxide, and 12 elements were targeted for elemental quantification, including potassium, sodium, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium, iron, chromium, zinc, copper, manganese, lead, and nickel. ICP-MS analysis was performed using highly sophisticated analytical technique of Perkin Elmer Sciex Elan DRC II Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometer. The topography of Ajwa powder was also examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM), which might affect the quantification of elements being analyzed. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was performed to check any possible chemical interaction after the grinding process. The study showed that certain elements including potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium had higher concentrations in Ajwa powder than Ajwa seeds. The concentrations of the elements such as potassium, phosphorus, and magnesium in the commercially available Ajwa powder were 1003.94 mg/100 g, 158.97 mg/100 g, and 114.10 mg/100 g, respectively. Ajwa powder generated by a mechanical grinder resulted in significant amount of potassium (739.17 mg/100 g), phosphorus (132.60 mg/100 g), and magnesium (39.55 mg/100 g). Moreover, different grinding methods resulted in different concentrations of the elements (calcium and sodium). Ajwa powder generated by motor and pestle yielded approximately 204.54 mg/100 g of calcium, which was significantly higher than commercial Ajwa powder (65.01 mg/100 g). Interestingly, FTIR data suggested a slightly shift of the chemical peaks from the commercial to lab grinded tested powder. This study signifies the medicinal effect of Ajwa in various pathological conditions by presenting major dietary value of key elements present in Ajwa. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	5	1011	1020	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-020-01945-7					FSTA:2021-08-Jg11007
J		Ali, Z. I.; Hanafy, M.; Chungyi Hansen; Saudi, A. M.; Talaat, A. M.							Genotypic analysis of nontuberculous mycobacteria isolated from raw milk and human cases in Wisconsin.		Journal of Dairy Science					Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) compose a group of mycobacteria that do not belong to the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex group. They are frequently isolated from environmental samples such as water, soil, and, to a lesser extent, food samples. Isolates of NTM represent a major health threat to humans worldwide, especially those who have asthma or are immunocompromised. Human disease is acquired from environmental exposures and through consumption of NTM-contaminated food. The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease in human is lung disease, but lymphatic, skin and soft tissue, and disseminated disease are also important. The main objective of the current study was to profile the farm-level contamination of cow milk with NTM by examining milk filters and bulk tank milk samples. Five different NTM species were isolated in one dairy herd in Wisconsin, with confirmed 16S rRNA genotypes including Mycobacterium fortuitum, Mycobacterium avium ssp. hominissuis, Mycobacterium abscessus, Mycobacterium simiae, and Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (Mycobacterium paratuberculosis). In tank milk samples, M. fortuitum was the predominant species in 48% of the samples, whereas M. chelonae/abscessus and M. fortuitum were the only 2 species obtained from 77 and 23% of the examined filters, respectively. Surprisingly, M. avium ssp. hominissuis, M. paratuberculosis, and M. simiae were isolated from 16.7, 10.4, and 4% of the examined milk samples, respectively, but not from milk filters. Interestingly, NTM isolates from human clinical cases in Wisconsin clustered very closely with those from milk samples. These findings suggest that the problem of NTM contamination is underestimated in dairy herds and could contribute to human infections with NTM. Overall, the study validates the use of bulk tank samples rather than milk filters to assess contamination of milk with NTM. Nontuberculous mycobacteria represent one type of pathogens that extensively contaminate raw milk at the farm level. The significance of our research is in evaluating the existence of NTM at the farm level and identifying a simple approach to examine the potential milk contamination with NTM members using tank milk or milk filters from dairy operations. In addition, we attempted to examine the potential link between NTM isolates found in the farm to those circulating in humans in Wisconsin. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, basil leaves were dried using natural, microwave-, and convective-drying methods from an initial moisture content of 90.900.1% to a final one of 8.210.12%. The natural drying was done in a controlled room at a temperature of 251 °C and relative humidity of 605%. The microwave-drying processes were performed using 100,300, 500,700, and 900 W microwave output powers, while 50 °C was used in convective-drying. The drying periods of different drying methods lasted between 16.5 and 1620 min. Consequently, the best drying method regarding drying period, energy consumption, protein amount, macronutrients (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and B), micronutrients (Cu, Zn, Fe, Mn and B), water-soluble vitamins (ascorbic acid, Vitamin B3 and Vitamin B6), fat-soluble vitamins (beta-carotene, Vitamin E, and Vitamin K), color parameters (L, a, b, C and alpha) and chlorophyll concentration was determined to be microwave-drying at 700 W.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Botanical origin of a bee pollen sample is frequently determined by palynological analysis which also enables classification of the bee pollen samples as monofloral and polyfloral. Nevertheless, palynological analysis does not give an insight on its chemical composition and thus its potential therapeutic activities. In this study, the relationship between the botanical origins, chemical compositions and biological activities of bee pollen samples were comparatively investigated. Firstly, bee pollen samples (PO1-11) were examined by palynological method and 5 of them were grouped as monofloral, and the rest was grouped as polyfloral bee pollen. Then, HPTLC analysis was performed for fingerprinting of the phenolic compounds and caffeic acid, isoquercitrin, galangin and chrysin were found the common phenolic components in the bee pollen samples, and these were assigned as "key markers". Then, a newly developed and validated HPLC method was applied to quantify these key markers in the samples. Furthermore, their total phenolic and total flavonoid contents were comparatively studied. Bioactivity of bee pollen samples were assessed by in-vitro antioxidant and antimicrobial activity tests. A polyfloral bee pollen sample (PO2) was found to exert the highest antioxidant activity. Besides, PO2 and PO9 (polyfloral) showed the highest antimicrobial activity. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Alina Hadi; Anjum Nawab; Feroz Alam; Kishwar Zehra							Physical, mechanical, optical, barrier, and antioxidant properties of sodium alginate-aloe vera biocomposite film.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Composite films of sodium alginate and Aloe vera gel were prepared using sorbitol as a plasticizer. These films were studied for their physical, mechanical, barrier, optical, and antioxidant properties. The results of the study showed a direct relationship between Aloe vera gel concentrations and total phenolic contents of the composite films. The phenolic compounds present in Aloe vera contribute to the antioxidant properties of the composite films. The results also indicated that the antioxidant activity of the composite films increased with the increasing concentration of Aloe vera reaching a maximum value at the maximum (50%) concentration of Aloe vera gel. The influence of Aloe vera in enhancing tensile strength was found to be more prominent, giving a maximum value of tensile strength at only 10% concentration of Aloe vera gel. The results also showed that the incorporation of Aloe vera gel into sodium alginate up to a concentration of 50% did not significantly alter the transparency of the composite films. The water vapor permeability of the films decreased with the increasing concentration of Aloe vera in the films. The solubility of the films increased with the increasing concentration of Aloe vera due to the presence of highly water-soluble compounds in Aloe vera gel. Novelty impact statement. Novel food packaging films based on two natural resources, that is, alginate and Aloe vera have been developed. Owing to their excellent transparency and colorlessness these films visually resemble synthetic plastic films but have a distinct advantage over synthetic packaging materials, of being biodegradable and edible. By the virtue of their good mechanical strength, barrier properties, and antioxidant activity these biodegradable active packaging films are a strong candidate to replace the synthetic plastic materials presently being used in the food packaging industry which contribute to environmental pollution. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15444					FSTA:2021-09-Fe2200

Stabilization of Arthrospira platensis with high-pressure processing and thermal treatments: effect on physico-chemical and microbiological quality.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) is a cyanobacterium that has been recently studied for food applications due to its high biological and nutritional value. When A. platensis is used as an ingredient in food applications, proper treatments have to be applied in order to reduce microbial contamination. This work compared the effect of thermal treatments (sterilization at 121 °C and pasteurization at 90 °C) and high-pressure processing (400, 600 MPa) on the chemical, physico-chemical, and microbial quality of 5% (wt/vol) A. platensis aqueous suspensions. Total antioxidant capacity, total polyphenols content, color, and pigments content were not strongly lowered/modified by the high-pressure processing (HPP) treatments. HPP at 400 MPa even improved the release of C-phycocyanin from the biomass because of the breakage of cell walls. HPP treatments were comparable to pasteurization in reducing yeasts, coliforms, Staphylococci, and total bacterial count. Conversely, sterilization was the only treatment that guaranteed the inactivation of spore-forming species but affecting the final quality. Novelty impact statement. High-pressure processing (HPP) treatments were found to be a good strategy to preserve or even improve some physical and chemical properties of Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina), in particular antioxidant capacity, polyphenols, color, and pigments content. Furthermore, HPP treatments were comparable to pasteurization in reducing microbial cell count, while sterilization was the only treatment able to ensure the inhibition of spore-forming species. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Assessment the influence of different drying methods and pre-storage periods on garlic (Allium Sativum L.) aroma using electronic nose.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Drying of garlic is one of the essential post-harvest processing techniques to increase the efficiency of its usage. The present study aimed to assess the influence of different drying methods (DMs) and various pre-storage periods (PSPs) on the aroma of dried garlic using an electronic nose (E-nose). Garlic was dried by near-infrared fluidized bed drying (NIFBD), atmospheric freeze-drying (AFD), and near-infrared vacuum drying (NIVD) methods after 1-, 8-, and 16-day PSPs. The results revealed that the highest and lowest drying rates occurred in the NIVD and AFD, respectively. As the PSP prolonged, the drying time of the product also increased. To analyze and classify the data obtained from the E-nose, the principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and backpropagation neural network (BPNN) methods were employed. The PCA results showed that the samples dehydrated by different DMs could be easily distinguished by assessing the garlic's aroma. However, various PSPs had a lower impact on the aroma of the samples than the DMs. Compared to the aroma classification of samples based on different PSPs, the LDA and BPNN methods were more accurate in classifying the aroma of samples based on different DMs. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	127		198	211	0960-3085				10.1016/j.fbp.2021.02.016					FSTA:2021-09-Te3259

Packaging of beef fillet with active chitosan film incorporated with epsilon-polylysine: an assessment of quality indices and shelf life.		Meat Science					In the current study, the effect on packaged beef fillets (1 * 5 * 8 cm) of using active chitosan film (1%) was investigated. The fillets were stored at 4 °C for 12 days, and the film contained epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) (0.3, 0.6, and 0.9% w/w). Chemical, microbiological, sensory properties, and quality indices of the fillets were investigated. Added to these factors was an assessment of the influence of epsilon-polylysine incorporation on the optical, structural, barrier, and mechanical specifications (elongation at break and tensile strength) of chitosan films. Based on the findings, a significant difference among the corresponding values to thickness, color, water vapor permeability (WVP), and mechanical specifications between the treated films by epsilon-PL and untreated films were noted. In addition, higher values of thickness and tensile strength were correlated with epsilon-PL added active chitosan films while compared with control samples. Additionally, no significant differences regarding the proximate composition (including protein, moisture, and fat) among beef fillet samples were observed. In this regard, due to significantly lower levels of pH, TVB-N, and TBARS epsilon-PL in enriched films, this technique demonstrated some protective effects on beef fillets. Another observation was that lower levels of the total viable count, coliform, mold, yeasts, and higher sensory properties were significantly associated with samples with added epsilon-PL (0.9%). Therefore, adding epsilon-PL into chitosan films could be introduced as an effective technique to extend the shelf life of beef fillets and maintain their quality indices during refrigerated storage.

Combined effects of epsilon-polylysine and epsilon-polylysine nanoparticles with plant extracts on the shelf life and quality characteristics of nitrite-free frankfurter-type sausages.		Meat Science					In this study, epsilon-polylysine (epsilon-PL) or epsilon-polylysine nanoparticle (epsilon-PLN) combined with plants extracts (including green tea, olive leaves and stinging nettle extracts) were used as nitrite replacers in frankfurter-type sausages. The sausage samples were wrapped in polyethylene bags (in vacuum conditions) and their physicochemical, microbiological and sensory properties were evaluated during 45 days of refrigerated storage. The results showed that the incorporation of epsilon-polylysine had no significant effects on proximate composition of sausages. However, epsilon-PL and epsilon-PLN sausages had significantly (P< 0.05) lower lightness, redness and higher yellowness compared to control samples. At the end of storage, sausages formulated with epsilon-PLN had significantly (P< 0.05) higher contents of phenolic compounds and lowest TBARS values. Microbiological counts also indicated that epsilon-PLN displayed significantly higher inhibitory effects. Higher sensory indices were obtained in epsilon-PLN sausages. Based on the obtained results, epsilon-PLN was effective to improve frankfurter-type sausages shelf life. Therefore, these ingredients could be useful for frankfurter-type sausages production as nitrite replacers. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Quality					The aim of the present study was to determine the most significant heavy metal concentration in hen eggs, in particular to compare the heavy metal concentration in eggs originating from industrial poultry farms versus free-range hens. The sampling process was carried out between October and December 2018, in the Republic of Kosovo. In total, 22 random egg samples were collected, with 54.5% and 45.5% of samples coming from poultry farms and free-range hens, respectively. The measurements of the heavy metals were taken by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), using a wide range of elements, and only the most important elements were reported, such as Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Hg, and Pb within the range of 0.48-8.45, 38.77-289, 4286.59-15383.74, 0.45-144.74, 61.68-550.59, 1078.04-11378.56, 0.29-35.42, 0.27-6.54, and 0.04-1.41mugkg-1, respectively. This study revealed that the heavy metals in eggs from free-range hens are richer in essential elements such as Mn, Fe, and Zn, while poultry farm eggs contain a higher contribution of Cr, Cd, As, and Pb. However, the daily intake of heavy metals from egg consumption was lower than the WHO-FAO advised provisional daily intake. Therefore, egg consumption does not exceed the safety levels of toxic metals and does not pose any risk to human health. Copyright © 2021 H. Aliu et al.

Development and characterization of corn starch-gelatin based edible films incorporated with mango and pineapple for active packaging.		Food Bioscience					The effect of corn starch-gelatin (CSG) films enriched (5-15% w/v) separately with mango (puree and peel) and pineapple pomace were characterized to analyse the functional properties for active packaging. The incorporation of mango puree (MP), MP with peel (MPP) and pineapple pomace (PP) improved the physicochemical properties including moisture content, swelling index, thickness and opacity, while tensile strength and elongation at break was better for the control CSG films. The biological properties such as antioxidant, antimicrobial activity and total phenolic content were increased with increase in concentration of all the films. The FTIR analysis showed a good interaction and blending of all the film constituents and the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed a closer resemblance of the films with that of the control. All films showed more than 50% biodegradability after 15 days. These biodegradable films from these tropical fruits with enhanced properties have the potential to be utilized for the formulation of edible food-packaging materials in the near future.

Control of microbial growth and lipid oxidation in beef using a Lepidium perfoliatum seed mucilage edible coating incorporated with chicory essential oil.		Food Science & Nutrition					In this study, chicory essential oil (CEO) was obtained by hydrodistillation-based extraction method and it was rich in camphor (31.3%) and phenolic compounds with outstanding antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. The CEO was then incorporated into Lepidium perfoliatum seed mucilage (LPSM) based aqueous solution to prepare an active CEO-loaded LPSM edible coating. The effect of the edible coating was then investigated on the quality and shelf life of beef slices during 7 days storage at 4 °C. The results revealed that beef slice coated with CEO-loaded LPSM edible coating had a significant inhibitory effect on its lipid oxidation and microbial growth. The CEO-LPSM coating also inhibited the weight and texture losses of beef slices during display more efficiently compared with the control and CEO-free LPSM coating. Besides, the beef slices coated with CEO-LPSM were the preferred samples in terms of sensory scores throughout the storage. Thus, using CEO-rich LPSM edible coating might inhibit decay and significantly improve the shelf life of fresh beef. © 2021 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J. d'						Probiotic potential of commercial dairy-associated protective cultures: in vitro and in vivo protection against Listeria monocytogenes infection.		Food Research International					Protective bacterial cultures (PCs) are commercially available to producers to control undesirable microbes in foods, including foodborne pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. They are generally recognized as safe for consumption and many are capable of producing bacteriocins. Yet their potential to act as probiotics and confer a health benefit on the host is not known. This study investigated the ability of three commercial PCs to survive human gastrointestinal conditions and exert anti-infective properties against L. monocytogenes. Counts of two PCs of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum remained unchanged after exposure to simulated gastrointestinal conditions, whereas counts of the PC Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis were reduced by 5.3 log CFU/mL. Cultures of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis adhered to human Caco-2 epithelial cells at ~ 6 log CFU/mL. This pretreatment reduced subsequent L. monocytogenes adhesion and invasion by 1-1.6 log CFU/mL and 3.8-4.9 log CFU/mL, respectively, compared to control. L. monocytogenes-induced cytotoxicity was also reduced from 29.1% in untreated monolayers to ~ 8% in those treated with PCs. Pretreatment of Caco-2 monolayers with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and one PC of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum reduced L. monocytogenes translocation by ≥1.2 log CFU/mL compared to control (≥ 94.5% inhibition). All PCs significantly reduced DextranFITC permeability through Caco-2 monolayers to approximately half that of control. Pretreatment with PCs also reduced L. monocytogenes-induced mortality in Caenorhabditis elegans. These findings demonstrate the potential for commercially produced PCs to exert probiotic effects in the host through protection against L. monocytogenes infection, thus providing an additional benefit to food safety beyond inhibiting pathogen growth, survival, and virulence in foods.

J		Aljasir, S. F.; D'Amico, D. J.	Amico, D. J. d'						Effect of pre-exposure to protective bacterial cultures in food on Listeria monocytogenes virulence.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Protective cultures (PCs) are capable of inhibiting the growth of foodborne pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes, in food products. However, their ability to attenuate pathogen virulence in food remains uninvestigated. In this study, we used an immunomagnetic separation approach to isolate the effect of pre-exposure to commercially produced PCs in milk as a model food on the subsequent ability of L. monocytogenes to survive simulated gastrointestinal conditions and infect human Caco-2 epithelial cells. Pre-exposure to two cultures of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum reduced the ability of L. monocytogenes to survive simulated gastrointestinal conditions with counts 2.7 log CFU/mL lower than control. The ability of L. monocytogenes to invade Caco-2 cells was also reduced by 1.5 and 2.3 log CFU/mL compared to control after exposure to Lactococcus lactis subsp. L actis and a strain of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, respectively. All Lactococcus lactis and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum cultures were able to limit the pathogen translocation across Caco-2 cells by 1.5-2.1 log CFU/mL less than that of control. When coupled with their antimicrobial activities against L. monocytogenes, these results demonstrate the ability of PCs to enhance the safety of food products by also attenuating the pathogen virulence, thereby impeding its ability to cause infection upon ingestion.

A comparative study of the influence of the content and source of beta-glucan on the rheological, microstructural properties and stability of milk gel during acidification.		Food Hydrocolloids					The aim of the study was a comprehensive, comparative study evaluating the impact of the addition level (0.125%, 0.25%, 0.5%, 1%) of highly purified beta-glucans isolated from bacteria (curdlan), fungi (scleroglucan) and oats on the stability, rheological and microstructural properties of milk gel during acidification with glucono-delta-lactone. Viscosity and susceptibility to shear thinning were lowest in aqueous solutions containing oat beta-glucan (OBG) and highest in solutions containing curdlan. Regardless of their addition level, curdlan and scleroglucan produced pseudoplastic fluid. Coagulation was most rapidly induced by scleroglucan, and it was most delayed under the influence of OBG. The susceptibility of acidified milk gel to phase separation was significantly influenced by the hydration properties and source of beta-glucan. Acidification of gels with the lowest concentration (0.125%) of scleroglucan and OBG promoted aggregation of the caseins and then phase separation. This behaviour was not observed in gels containing linear beta-glucan (curdlan). The images acquired under a confocal microscope revealed that the all analysed preparations significantly affected the formation of protein complexes whose size and shape were closely linked with the type of added beta-glucan. The morphology of samples containing curdlan most closely resembled the structure of the control gel. The addition (up to 0.5%) of scleroglucan and OBG resulted in a gel with low stability. Separate protein structures and clusters of beta-glucan were found. The addition of higher levels of beta-glucan resulted in a more homogeneous microstructure of the product, which was similar to the control acidified gels. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Alka Mishra; Laxmana Swamy, S.; Kumar Thakur, T.; Rajeev Bhat; Arvind Bijalwan; Amit Kumar							Use of wild edible plants: can they meet the dietary and nutritional needs of indigenous communities in central India.		Foods					Despite significant evidence base on quantifying ecosystem services, the role of biodiversity in supporting such services in diversified landscapes, and how indigenous communities exploit, utilize and manage plant resources in a biocultural regime, remains understudied. This study examines the role of wild edible plants (WEPs) in meeting the food, nutrition and household income of indigenous communities under the biodiversity rich landscape of the Achanakmaar-Amarkantak Biosphere Reserve (AABR-22°15′ to 22°58′ N latitudes and 81°25′ to 82°5′ East longitudes) of Central India. Results revealed remarkable differences among Baiga, Gond, Kol, and Oraon ethnic communities and also location (core, buffer and transition) effect on utilization pattern of wild edibles. A sum total of 172 WEPs comprising 60 vegetables, 70 fruits, seeds and nuts, 23 underground tubers and 19 mushrooms were collected, consumed, and surplus were marketed by the communities. On average, the number of wild edibles collected annually by households were in the following quantities: 40-240 kg leafy vegetables, 125-386 kg flowers, 120-250 kg fruits, 12-125 kg legumes, 24-120 kg tubers, 5-35 kg mushrooms. Among ethnic groups, the Baiga primitive community utilized 70-90% followed by Gonds (58-81%), Kols (52-78%), Oraons (43-79%), and other communities (38-68%) in different zones. WEPs have contributed to 5-24% (Rs 3559-12,710) of household income, which was highest in the core zone and lowest in the transition zone. It was observed that WEPs were complemented the diets rather than being a substitute for staple foods. They supplied only 3.7-8.3% of energy and 1.1-4.9% protein requirements; however, they significantly supplemented ascorbic acid, thiamine, calcium, and iron by 38.1-73%, 13.7-35.4%, 17.2-29.1%, 2.6-13.5%, respectively. Significantly higher quantities of nutrients were supplemented in the core zone compared to other zones. WEPs were currently underutilized (less intake) especially in buffer and transition zones, complementing the staple foods and partially supplementing the essential macro-and micro-nutrients. However, these have the potential to fulfill the dietary needs and ensure balanced nutrition, if consumed in recommended portions and sizes. The paper discusses policy implications that ensure coherence and coordination of local indigenous communities for conservation and sustainable utilization of WEPs of AABR, Central India. © 2021 by the authors.

Influence of different drying methods on antioxidant activity, total phenol, and phenolic compounds of myrtle (Myrtus communis L.) fruits.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The antioxidant activity increased from 25.43% to 83.55% when dried at room temperature. Methanolic extracts of the all dried berries showed strong antioxidant activity against DPPH radicals in comparison to fresh samples. The highest total phenolics (135.07 mg/100 g) were detected in microwave-dried fruit, and followed by (115.63 mg/100 g) in samples dried at room temperature. 1,2-Dihydroxybenzene (118.57 mg/100 g), catechin (52.71 mg/100 g), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (29.01 mg/100 g) in fresh berries were increased to 251.43,158.98, and 110.99 mg/100 g in microwave dried ones, respectively. However, only gallic acid contents decreased from 131.54 mg/100 g in fresh samples to 23.74 mg/100 g in microwave treated one. It can be inferred that dried myrtle fruit is good source of antioxidant and phenolic compounds. Myrtle fruit can be effectively used for the recovery of bioactive compounds which have useful functional properties and can be employed in the development of functional foods and nutraceuticals. Practical applications. Drying processes are also applied to extract bioactive compounds from plant matrix (seed, fruit, leaf, etc.). Different drying methods can cause changes in the contents and availability of biologically important compounds from these matrices. Microwave energy and oven drying have been widely used in various processes. The results of current study are hence useful for the optimal processing of plant materials for the recovery of different phytochemicals and their use. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Foods					Ohmic-vacuum combination heating is a common method used in the food industry as a concentration process. In the present study, an OH-VC combination heating system was developed for producing tomato paste at temperatures of 70, 80, and 90°C and pressure of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 bar and electric field of 1.82, 2.73, and 3.64 V/cm using a central composite design. The effects of heating conditions on the quality and sensory evaluation of tomato paste were also evaluated. Each combination of temperature, pressure, and the electric field was quantified for specific energy consumption, energy efficiency, and productivity. A decrease of 35.08% in the amount of acid ascorbic and lycopene content 19.01%, using conventional heating compared to ohmic-vacuum heating under optimized conditions, was attained. The results also highlighted an increase in the amount of HMF (69.79%) and PME (24.33%) using conventional heating compared to ohmic-vacuum heating under optimized conditions. Ascorbic acid, lycopene, titratable acidity, productivity, energy efficiency was higher than conventional heating; on the other hand, HMF, PME, pH, SEC were lower than conventional heating at the applied OH-VC process. No significant effects between OH-VC and conventional heating on the TSS were observed. In addition, OH-VC heating was highly efficient in the inhibition of bacterial growth. Further, a minor effect on the sensory properties of tomato paste with OH-VC heating compared to the conventional treatment. The obtained results indicate a strong potential for an OH-VC combination heating system as a rapid-heating, high-efficiency alternative for saving electrical energy consumption and preserving nutritional value. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alkin, M.; Sogut, E.; Seydim, A. C.							Determination of bioactive properties of different edible mushrooms from Turkey.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, dry matter, total ash, total phenolic content, antioxidant capacities, antimicrobial activity, and phenolic acid contents of nine different mushrooms (Lactarius deliciosus, Agaricus bisporus, Lentinus edodes, Pleurotus ostreatus, Ganoderma lucidum, Hericium erinaceus, Morchella spp., Boletus edulis, Cantharellus cibarius) from Turkey were determined. Water (W), methanol (M), and water-methanol mixture (W/M, 50:50 v/v) were used to extract phenolic substances from dried mushroom samples. Generally, W extracts showed higher values in total phenolic content and antioxidant capacity values. W extracts of B. edulis (17.11 mg/g), Morchellaspp. (14.19 mg/g). Moreover, P. ostreatus (10.85 mg/g) had the highest phenolic contents (p<0.05). The lowest antioxidant capacity values were found in W/M extracts of C. cibarius (20.22 mumol/g), and L. deliciosus(28.77 mumol/g) and M extract of P. ostreatus(31.61 mumol/g) mushrooms (p<0.05). W and W/M extracts were more efficient in inhibiting Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus than M extracts. Besides, B. edulis and C. cibarius species were found to have the strongest antimicrobial activity. Besides,B. edulisand P. ostreatushave been found to contain the highest phenolic acid compounds (p<0.05), supporting the high content of total phenolic contents and antioxidant properties. This study revealed that these mushrooms have the potential to be used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Allah Bakhsh; Se-Jin Lee; Eun-Yeong Lee; Nahar Sabikun; Young-Hwa Hwang; Seon-Tea Joo							A novel approach for tuning the physicochemical, textural, and sensory characteristics of plant-based meat analogs with different levels of methylcellulose concentration.		Foods					This study assessed the effects of Methylcellulose (MC) at different concentrations on plant-based meat analog (PBMA) patties, comprised of commercial texture vegetable protein (C-TVP) and textured isolate soy protein (T-ISP) as key ingredients, and compared to beef patty control. A significantly higher difference was observed in moisture content in control with increasing MC concentration than the C-TVP and T-ISP patties. However, protein varied significantly among three different protein sources, with control had higher protein content than PBMA patties. Crude fiber content recorded higher values in C-TVP as compared to control. Significantly lower pH values were recorded in control than C-TVP and T-ISP respectively. Regardless, with the addition of MC or ingredient PBMA and control patties tend to reduce lightness (L*) and redness (a*) value after cooking. Although control sample before cooking exhibits lighter and redder than PBMA patties (C-TVP and T-ISP). Likewise, water holding capacity (WHC) decreases as the concentration of MC increases (1.5-4%) in control and PBMA patties. Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF) and texture profile analysis (TPA), including hardness, chewiness, and gumminess of control, were significantly higher than C-TVP and T-ISP. Consequently, panelists" in the sensory analysis presented that C-TVP patties containing 3% of MC had better sensory properties than T-ISP. Hence, PBMA patties with C-TVP and incorporation of 3% MC are considered ideal for manufacturing of meat analog as related to control (beef). © 2021 by the authors.

J		Allah Bakhsh; Se-Jin Lee; Eun-Yeong Lee; Young-Hwa Hwang; Seon-Tea Joo							Characteristics of beef patties substituted by different levels of textured vegetable protein and taste traits assessed by electronic tongue system.		Foods					The main objective of this study was to incorporate soy-based textured vegetable protein (TVP) into beef patties in different quantities (10-40%) and compare various characteristics of these innovative formulations with a regular beef patty as a control. Incorporation of 10-40% TVP resulted in significantly lower (p< 0.05) moisture and fat contents, while higher crude fiber contents were detected compared to beef as the control. In addition, cooked patties showed higher pH levels (p< 0.05), with color coordinates expressing lighter, yellowish, and slightly redder indices than raw patties. Similarly, a plant protein that includes TVP minimizes (p< 0.05) WHC (water holding capacity), both RW% (release water) and CL% (cooking loss). Furthermore, hardness, cohesiveness, and thickness were reduced significantly (p< 0.05), while gumminess and chewiness increased (p< 0.05) considerably with the substitution of TVP (10-40%) compared to the control. Patties made without TVP received higher scores for sourness, bitterness, umami, and richness than the rest of the formulations. However, a higher tendency was detected for sourness, astringency, umami, and saltiness values with increasing additions of TVP. Nevertheless, hierarchical clustering revealed that the largest group of fatty acid profiles, including palmitoleic acid (C16:1), stearic acid (C18:0), and palmitic acid (C16:0), was slightly reduced with the addition of TVP, while arachidic acid (C20:0), lauric acid (C12:0), and oleic acid (C18:1) increased moderately with increasing levels of TVP. Meanwhile, the second-largest cluster that included linoleic acid (C18:2), arachidonic acid (C20:4), and linolenic acid (C18:3) increased enormously with higher levels of TVP incorporation. Taken together, it is suggested that incorporation of TVP up to 10-40% in beef patties shows promising results. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Allan, M. C.; Marinos, N.; Johanningsmeier, S. D.; Sato, A.; Truong, V. D.							Relationships between isolated sweetpotato starch properties and textural attributes of sweetpotato French fries.		Journal of Food Science					Sweetpotato French fry (SPFF) textures have been associated with dry matter and starch contents, but these do not fully account for all textural differences. This study investigated the relationships between the physicochemical properties of sweetpotato starch and textural attributes of sweetpotato fries. Starches from 16 sweetpotato genotypes that varied in dry matter content were isolated and analyzed. The amylose content, pasting temperatures and viscosities, and textural properties of equilibrated starch gels were measured. Correlational analysis was performed with the respective SPFF mechanical and sensory texture attributes. Sweetpotato starch amylose content ranged from 17.3% to 21.1%, and the pasting and gel textural properties varied significantly between starches. Starch from orange-fleshed sweetpotatoes had lower pasting temperatures than starches from yellow/cream-fleshed genotypes, 72.2 2.0 and 75.5 1.1 °C, respectively. Notable inverse correlations were observed between the starch pasting temperature and perceived moistness (r = -0.63) and fibrousness (r = -0.70) of fries, whereas SPFF denseness was positively associated with starch pasting viscosity (r= 0.60) and nonstarch alcohol-insoluble solids content. Fry textures were likely affected by cooked starch properties, which should be considered when selecting varieties for sweetpotato fries. Practical Application. Without the aid of a batter, sweetpotato French fries (SPFFs) tend to be soft and limp-undesirable attributes in a fried food. The physiochemical properties of starch, the most abundant component in sweetpotato fries, were further explored in this study to better understand the properties of sweetpotato starch that influence SPFF textures. These findings can be used by sweetpotato processors and breeders for developing new sweetpotato varieties that are designed for production of fried products with desirable textures. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Allen, M. M.; Pike, O. A.; Kenealey, J. D.; Dunn, M. L.							Metabolomics of acid whey derived from Greek yogurt.		Journal of Dairy Science					Acid whey, a byproduct of Greek yogurt production, has little commercial value due to its low protein content and is also environmentally harmful when disposed of as waste. However, as a product of microbial fermentation, acid whey could be a rich source of beneficial metabolites associated with fermented foods. This study increases understanding of acid whey composition by providing a complete metabolomic profile of acid whey. Commercial and laboratory-made Greek yogurts, prepared with 3 different bacterial culture combinations, were evaluated. Samples of uncultured milk and cultured whey from each batch were analyzed. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics were used to separate and identify 477 metabolites. Compared with uncultured controls, acid whey from fermented yogurt showed decreases in some metabolites and increases in others, presumably due to the effects of microbial metabolism. Additional metabolites appeared in yogurt whey but not in the uncultured control. Therefore, the effect of microbial fermentation is complex, leading to increases or decreases in potentially bioactive bovine metabolites while generating new microbial compounds that may be beneficial. Metabolite production was significantly affected by combinations of culturing organisms and production location. Differences between laboratory-made and commercial samples could be caused by different starting ingredients, environmental factors, or both.

J		Allen, M. S.; Yun Ying							Effects of corn grain endosperm type and conservation method on feed intake, feeding behavior, and productive performance of lactating dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our objective was to evaluate the effects of corn grain varying in endosperm type and conserved as high-moisture or dry ground corn on dry matter intake (DMI), feeding behavior, ruminal fermentation, and yields of milk and milk components of cows in early to mid-lactation. Seven ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows (7339 d in milk; meanSD) were used in a duplicated 4*4 Latin square design with 21-d periods. A 2*2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used with main effects of corn grain endosperm type (floury or vitreous) conserved as high-moisture corn (HMC) or dry ground corn (DGC). Rations were formulated to contain 27.0% starch, 26.6% neutral detergent fiber (NDF), 19.1% forage NDF, and 16.5% crude protein. Corn grain treatments supplied 86.6% of dietary starch and contained alfalfa silage as the sole forage. Dry matter intake was increased 1.3 kg/d by DGC compared with HMC. The increase in DMI by DGC was related to a shorter intermeal interval (104.4 vs. 118.2 min/d), and meal size was not affected by treatment. Dry ground corn decreased rumination bout length and number of chews per bout compared with HMC. No differences were detected between endosperm treatments for DMI, yields of milk, 3.5% fat-corrected milk (FCM), milk fat, protein, lactose, or solids-not-fat (SNF). Mean yield of 3.5% FCM across treatments was 47.5 kg/d. However, a tendency for an interaction was observed for feed efficiency; floury endosperm increased efficiency 0.05 kg 3.5% FCM per kg of DMI for DGC but decreased it by 0.14 kg 3.5% FCM per kg of DMI for HMC relative to vitreous endosperm. Vitreous compared with floury corn tended to increase true protein concentration in milk when conserved as DGC (2.68% vs. 2.62%) but not as HMC. Concentration of SNF was increased by DGC compared with HMC (8.45 vs. 8.37%) due, in part, to the effect of treatment on milk protein concentration. Body weight was not affected by treatment, but vitreous endosperm tended to increase loss of body condition compared with floury endosperm. Corn endosperm type and conservation method had little effect on productive performance of high-producing cows. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Allen, M. S.; Longuski, R. A.; Yun Ying							Effects of corn grain endosperm type and fineness of grind on feed intake, feeding behavior, and productive performance of lactating dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our objective was to evaluate effects of corn grain endosperm type and fineness of grind on feed intake, feeding behavior, ruminal fermentation, and productive performance of lactating cows. Eight ruminally and duodenally cannulated Holstein cows in mid lactation (13042 d in milk; meanstandard deviation) were used in a duplicated 4*4 Latin square design with 21-d periods. A 2*2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used with main effects of corn grain endosperm type (floury or vitreous) and fineness of grind of corn grain (fine or medium). Rations were formulated to contain 29% starch, 27% neutral detergent fiber, 18.2% forage neutral detergent fiber, and 18% crude protein. Corn grain treatments supplied 86.2% of dietary starch. Endosperm was 25% vitreous for floury corn and 66% vitreous for vitreous corn. Fineness of grind did not affect dry matter intake (DMI), but floury corn tended to reduce DMI (23.8 vs. 25.1 kg/d) compared with vitreous corn. Floury corn increased meal frequency more for fine grind size (9.57 vs. 9.41 meals/d) than medium grind size (9.78 vs. 9.75 meals/d). However, there were no effects of treatment on any other measure of feeding behavior. Endosperm type did not affect yields of milk or milk components or milk composition except that vitreous corn tended to decrease milk lactose concentration compared with floury corn. Finely ground corn decreased yields of milk (31.1 vs. 33.1 kg/d), 3.5% fat-corrected milk (33.1 vs. 35.1 kg/d), milk fat (1.22 vs. 1.32 kg/d), milk lactose (1.48 vs. 1.59 kg/d), and solids not fat (2.46 vs. 2.63 kg/d) compared with medium grind size. However, fineness of grind did not affect milk composition. Treatments had no effect on change in body weight or body condition score or efficiency of milk production (kg of 3.5% fat-corrected milk/kg of DMI). Mean ruminal pH was not affected by treatment, but pH variance was decreased by vitreous compared with floury corn. Total volatile fatty acids and propionate concentrations in the rumen were increased by floury compared with vitreous corn but were not affected by fineness of grind. Effects of fineness of grind on yield of milk and milk components were greater than the effects of corn grain vitreousness. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Allen, P.							Recent developments in the objective measurement of carcass and meat quality for industrial application.		Meat Science					This paper summarises the contents of this Special Edition. The papers cover a range of advanced technologies for the objective measurement of carcass characteristics that influence the yield and potential eating quality of beef and lamb carcasses. All the research has been carried out in Australia and New Zealand and has been centrally funded with collaboration between various groups. This Special Edition is timely since the meat industry is coming under pressure on environmental grounds in addition to health warnings about excessive meat consumption. In this respect it is encouraging that so many of the papers relate to eating quality. The emphasis on objective methods is also important as moving away from traditional subjective grading will improve accuracy and consistency and thereby increase efficiency. Some differences in the approach taken in other parts of the world are discussed.

EFSA Panel on Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ)				Maximum levels of cross-contamination for 24 antimicrobial active substances in non-target feed. Part 2: aminoglycosides/aminocyclitols: apramycin, paromomycin, neomycin and spectinomycin.		EFSA Journal					The specific concentrations of apramycin, paromomycin, neomycin and spectinomycin in non-target feed for food-producing animals, below which there would not be an effect on the emergence of, and/or selection for, resistance in bacteria relevant for human and animal health, as well as the specific antimicrobial concentrations in feed which have an effect in terms of growth promotion/increased yield, were assessed by EFSA in collaboration with EMA. Details of the methodology used for this assessment, associated data gaps and uncertainties, are presented in a separate document. To address antimicrobial resistance, the Feed Antimicrobial Resistance Selection Concentration (FARSC) model developed specifically for the assessment was applied. However, due to the lack of data on the parameters required to calculate the FARSC for these antimicrobials, it was not possible to conclude the assessment until further experimental data become available. To address growth promotion, data from scientific publications obtained from an extensive literature review were used. Levels in feed that showed to have an effect on growth promotion/increased yield were reported for apramycin and neomycin, whilst for paromomycin and spectinomycin, no suitable data for the assessment were available. It was recommended to carry out studies to generate the data that are required to fill the gaps which prevented the calculation of the FARSC for these four antimicrobials. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Assessment of (-) epicatechin as natural additive for improving safety and functionality in fresh "Piel de Sapo" melon juice.		Food Science & Nutrition					Epicatechin (EC) is a very abundant flavonoid in vegetable tissues that presents high antioxidant activity in living systems. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of (-) EC was determined in three species of bacteria commonly associated with foodborne illness of plant origin: Listeria (L.) monocytogenes, Escherichia (E.) coli-serogroups O157: H7 and O111-and Bacillus (B.) cereus; two strains of probiotic-type lactic acid bacteria (PT-LAB) and two control strains. All 10 strains were assayed under three temperature conditions (30°, 10°, and 4°C) and at each temperature under two pH conditions (6.7 and 5.5). Mean EC MIC values were generally lower at refrigeration (4°and 10°C) temperatures and at standard pH (6.7). By inoculating with each of the strains separately, both melon juice (MJ) and MJ supplemented with EC (ECSMJ), at the accepted maximum sensorial limit, and storing them at 4°C for 10 days; the final counts (CFU/mL) were lower for ECSMJ than for plain MJ both for pathogenic bacteria and for PT-LAB. The presence of EC during refrigerated storage counteracted the ability of MJ as a growth medium for all the pathogenic bacteria. ECSMJ increased the antioxidant activity of MJ significantly to levels similar to those of EC alone. (-) Epicathechin would be a promising ingredient for increasing the functional properties of "Piel de Sapo" MJ (phenolic compounds and antioxidant ability) while contributing to improving the safety of this type of juice during prolonged refrigerated storage at 4°C. © 2021 The Authors.

Validation of the one broth one plate for Salmonella method for detection of Salmonellaspp. in select food and environmental samples: AOAC Performance Tested MethodSM 102002.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. One Broth One Plate for Salmonella (OBOP Salmonella) is a rapid and simple method for detection of Salmonella spp. in food and environmental samples using traditional culture methodology. The method utilizes single-step enrichment followed by plating to a selective/differential, chromogenic agar. Objective. The purpose of the validation study was to measure the effectiveness of the OBOP Salmonella method in comparison to reference culture procedures. Method. Performance of the OBOP Salmonella method was compared to that of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Bacteriological Analytical Manual Chapter 5 reference method for queso fresco, smoked salmon, cantaloupe, chocolate, black pepper, chili powder, dry pet food, and sponge samples from a stainless steel surface, or to that of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Microbiology Laboratory Guidebook Chapter 4.10 method for raw ground turkey, chicken carcass rinse, and pasteurized liquid egg. Inclusivity/exclusivity, robustness, and stability/lot-to-lot consistency testing was also performed.ResultsIn the matrix study, there were no statistically significant differences in performance between the OBOP Salmonella and reference methods, as determined by probability of detection analysis (P<0.05), for any of the matrixes examined. All 104 Salmonella spp. strains produced positive results in inclusivity testing, and all 33 non-salmonellae exclusivity strains tested negative with the OBOP Salmonella method. Conclusions. Results of the validation study show that the OBOP Salmonella method is a reliable procedure for detection of Salmonella spp. in select matrixes. The method is simple to perform, requires no specialized equipment, and produces results in as little as 37h.HighlightsThe OBOP Salmonella method was awarded AOAC PTMSM (#102002) for detection of Salmonella in queso fresco, smoked salmon, cantaloupe, chocolate, black pepper, chili powder, dry pet food, sponge samples on a stainless steel surface, raw ground turkey, chicken carcass rinse, and pasteurized liquid egg. The method is also approved by MicroVal for a broad range of foods under certification number 2019LR88. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2021.										2021	104	3	765	775	1060-3271				10.1093/jaoacint/qsaa149					FSTA:2022-01-Cd0194
J		Allison, R. B.; Sacks, G. L.							Brine-releasable hydrogen sulfide in wine: mechanism of release from copper complexes and effects of glutathione.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Copper-sulfhydryl complexes in wine can be disrupted by addition of brine to release free hydrogen sulfide (H2S), and the resulting "brine-releasable H2S" is reported to correlate with formation of H2S during bottle storage. However, both the mechanism of the brine-release assay and factors affecting the stability of copper sulfhydryls under brine-release conditions are not well understood. By varying brine composition and concentration, it is shown that release of copper-complexed H2S requires the presence of a halide (Cl- and Br-) and is not due to a general "salting-out" effect. Release of copper-complexed H2S by the brine dilution assay is highly temperature-dependent. When H2S and Cu (II) are added to a model wine, brine-releasable H2S decreases markedly (~10-fold) after a 20 min incubation period prior to performing the brine-release assay. In commercial wines, the fraction of added H2S recovered through the brine-release assay was correlated with the initial glutathione (GSH) concentration (r2=0.58) but not with initial Cu. Negligible additional release of H2S from organopolysulfanes was observed following addition of a disulfide-reducing agent (tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine). As previous studies have reported a correlation between H2S formed under brine-release conditions and normal storage, these results suggest that the susceptibility of a wine to form latent copper-sulfhydryl precursors of H2S following copper addition is dependent on the concentration of sulfhydryls like GSH.										2021	69	44	13164	13172	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04885					FSTA:2022-03-Hj2175

Assessing the impact of nitrogen supplementation in oats across multiple growth locations and years with targeted phenotyping and high-resolution metabolite profiling approaches.		Food Chemistry					Oats (Avena sativa L.) are a healthy food, being high in dietary fibre (e.g. beta-glucans), antioxidants, minerals, and vitamins. Understanding the effect of variety and crop management on nutritional quality is important. The response of four oat varieties to increased nitrogen levels was investigated across multiple locations and years with respect to yield, grain quality and metabolites (assessed via GC- and LC- MS). A novel high-resolution UHPLC-PDA-MS/MS method was developed, providing improved metabolite enrichment, resolution, and identification. The combined phenotyping approach revealed that, amino acid levels were increased by nitrogen supplementation, as were total protein and nitrogen containing lipid levels, whereas health-beneficial avenanthramides were decreased. Although nitrogen addition significantly increased grain yield and beta-glucan content, supporting increasing the total nitrogen levels recommended within agricultural guidelines, oat varietal choice as well as negative impacts upon health beneficial secondary metabolites and the environmental burdens associated with nitrogen fertilisation, require further consideration.

Wheat-durum pasta added of inactivated Bifidobacterium animalis decreases glucose and total cholesterol levels and modulates gut microbiota in healthy rats.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					This study investigated the effects of consumption of wheat-durum pasta added of Bifidobacterium animalis inactivated by gamma-irradiation (paraprobiotic) on health and gut microbiota of rats. Twenty-one male rats were divided into three groups as follow: control (Control) receiving standard diet; pasta control (PC) receiving diet containing pasta, and paraprobiotic pasta Bifidobacterium-irradiated (PPBI), receiving paraprobiotic pasta. The serum levels of glucose and total cholesterol were reduced (p<0.05) in PPBI when compared to the Control (p<0.05). PPBI showed high abundance (p<0.05) of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria and a lower abundance of Bacteriodes compared to Control and PC. Besides, the PPBI showed high abundance (p<0.05) of Clostridiales, Lactobacillales; Bifidobacteriales, Bacillales, and Coriobacteriales in comparison to Control. Specific genera such as Bifibacterium, Lactobacillus, Ruminococcus, Allobaculum, and Blautia were more related to PPBI. Findings reveal wheat-durum pasta as a potential vehicle for delivering paraprobiotics B. animalis. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					This study investigated the effects of feeding paraprobiotics obtained by six processes [heat, ultrasound, high pH, low pH, irradiation and supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2)] on biochemical parameters and intestinal microbiota of Wistar male rats. Daily administration of paraprobiotics did not affect (p≥0.05) the food intake, body weight, glucose and triglycerides levels, expression of antioxidant enzymes or thermal shock proteins in comparison to the control. Bifidobacterium lactis inactivated by irradiation and supercritical CO2 decreased the total cholesterol levels in serum (p<0.05). Bifidobacterium lactis inactivated by supercritical CO2 increased the albumin and creatinine levels, while decreased the HDL-cholesterol levels (p<0.05). Clostridiales (45.6-56%), Bacteroidales (31.9-44.2%) and Lactobacillales (3.9-7.8%) corresponded to the major orders in paraprobiotic groups. The properties of paraprobiotics are dependent on the method of inactivation, the intensity of the method employed and on the strain used. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Obtaining paraprobiotics from Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium animalis using six inactivation methods: impacts on the cultivability, integrity, physiology, and morphology.		Journal of Functional Foods					This study aimed to determine the suitable inactivation conditions of ultrasound and other five methods [heat, low pH, high pH, gamma irradiation and supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2)] to obtain paraprobiotics from Lactobacilus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei and Bifidobacterium animalis. The impact of each method at distinct conditions of inactivation was assessed by plate culturing and, the physiological and morphological aspects of the inactivated cells were assessed by a combined approach of flow cytometry and field-emission scanning electron microscopy analysis. The ability to grow on culture media after exposure to distinct processes or different conditions of the same process largely varied among the tested strains. The exposure to the best conditions defined for the distinct processes for inactivation of each strain resulted in distinct (p<0.05) percentages of cells with active enzymatic metabolism and integrity of membranes. After the ultrasound treatment, L. casei presented the highest and lowest percentages of enzymatic activity (86.2%) and damage to membrane integrity (4.6%) among the tested strains, respectively. Morphological characteristics of L. casei were similar after exposure to the distinct processes tested. Otherwise, ultrasound deeply affected the morphological aspects of L. acidophilus and B. animalis, and compromised the enzymatic activity in a great percentage of cells of these bacteria (>80%). The extension of damage to the cell surface, changes in cell roughness, lysed cells and cell debris varied with the tested strain and the inactivation method. Results indicate that the inactivation method defines the physiological and morphological conditions in each derived paraprobiotic that must be optimized for each strain. Findings suggest ultrasound as a feasible method to obtain L. casei paraprobiotics with an active metabolism. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Quantifying the impact of eight unit operations on the survival of eight Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties.		Food Research International					This study assessed the impact of eight unit operations [slow pasteurization, high-temperature short time (HTST) pasteurization, cooking, baking, drying, fermentation, supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2), irradiation and extrusion] in different food matrices (milk, orange juice, meatballs, bread, crystallized pineapple, yogurt, orange juice, ground black pepper, snacks, and spaghetti) on the resistance of eight (Bacillus flexus Hk1 Bacillus subtilis Bn1, Bacillus licheniformis Me1, Bacillus mojavensis KJS3, Bacillus subtilis PXN21, Bacillus subtilis PB6, Bacillus coagulans MTCC 5856 and Bacillus coagulans GBI-30, 6086) Bacillus strains with claimed probiotic properties (PB). The number of decimal reductions (gamma) caused by the unit operations varied (p < 0.05) amongst the PB. Most of the unit operations caused ≤ 2 gamma of PB in the food matrices evaluated. Irradiation caused up to 4.9 gamma (p < 0.05) amongst the PB tested. B. subtilis Bn1, B. mojavensis KJS3, B. licheniformis Me1, and B. coagulans GBI-30 showed higher resistance to most of the tested unit operations. These results indicate that the choice of PB for application in foods should also be based on their resistance to unit operations employed during processing. Finally, the high resistance of PB to the unit operations tested comprise valuable data for the development and diversification of probiotic foods with sporeforming strains with claimed probiotic properties.

Effects of microwave heat treatment on fungal growth, functional properties, total phenolic content, and antioxidant activity of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) grain.		Food Chemistry					Sorghum grains were subjected to microwave heating at different power levels 350 and 500 W for application times of 15, 30, and 45 s. The effect of microwave heating on fungal growth, protein content, in vitro digestibility, protein solubility, and functional and antioxidant properties of sorghum grain was investigated. The microwave heating at 350 and 500 W significantly reduced fungal incidence in the grain up to 26.2 and 33.4%. No significant changes were found in the crude protein and digestibility of protein, water holding capacity, and oil holding capacity of sorghum. However, application of microwave energy at 500 W for 30 & 45 s caused a sharp reduction on the protein solubility (8.2-7.6%), foaming capacity (6.47-0.98%), emulsion capacity (0.43-0.32 mL/g) and the emulsion stability (2.2-1.6%) of sorghum grain, respectively. Conversely, a significant increment of grain total phenolic content up to 47.1 and 50.8 mg GAE/g and the antioxidant activity up to 40.9 and 59.1% after microwave heat treatment at 350 and 500 W for 45 s, respectively, was observed. These findings revealed that sorghum grain should be treated with microwave at 350 and 500 W for 45 and 15 s, respectively, in order to maintained and enhanced its functional and nutritional properties. Accordingly, microwave heating, particularly at low power, may be an effective emerging method for improving the physicochemical and nutritional properties of sorghum grain.

Food Chemistry					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of acetic (AA) or propionic (PA) acid as a cosurfactant on the microemulsion (ME) characteristics of Thymus vulgaris essential oil (TVO). The results showed that addition of propylene glycol to TVO/AA or PA:T80/water MEs gave dilutable systems with particles ~59 nm in diameter. Plain TVO showed the highest antimicrobial activity against E. coli, S. aureus, and S. typhi in in vitro antimicrobial tests, followed closely by AA/PA-MEs. The antimicrobial activity of AA/PA-MEs used as a washing solution on cucumber and strawberry samples was remarkably greater than those of free TVO, TVO nanoemulsions, and chlorhexidine solutions against E. coli and S. aureus. The sensory properties of the samples were not changed by the use of AA/PA-MEs at 0.05 or 0.1% TVO. The results introduce dilutable TVO:AA/PA-MEs for incorporation of TVO in aqueous systems for use as a fruit/vegetable disinfecting agent. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Brazilian grown cascade hop (Humulus lupulus L.): LC-ESI-MS-MS and GC-MS analysis of chemical composition and antioxidant activity of extracts and essential oils.		Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists					The first harvest of Humulus lupulus (var. Cascade) in Brazil in 2016 originated as an aromatic hop that nowadays is gaining attention from the brewery industry. However, the chemical composition and the properties of this hop have not been well documented to date. In this study, the chemical profile of the phenolic compounds and essential oils of Cascade hops produced in Brazil (BH) and the USA (UH) was determined. The major phenolic compounds identified by LC-ESI-MS-MS in BH and UH were protocatechuic acid, isoquercitrin, and ferulic acid (4.18-11.39; 2.44-4.90; and 1.45-4.48 mg 100 g-1, respectively). The profile of essential oils was shown to differ between the two samples. The compounds trans-beta-farnesene (20.60%), beta-selinene (18.78%), myrcene (16.57%), and alpha-selinene (16.22%) were the main compounds in the BH essential oil, while the essential oil of UH showed a high content of alpha-humulene (35.35%), myrcene (22.35%), beta-caryophyllene (12.81%), and trans-beta-farnesene (10.59%). A higher antioxidant activity (by DPPH and ABTS) was observed for hop extracts when compared to the essential oils. The results indicated that the Brazilian hop sample analyzed had higher radical scavenging when compared to an American hop sample (associated with its bioactive compound composition). The Cascade hop from Brazil appears to be a high-quality raw material showing significant potential for future industrial applications. © 2020 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.										2021	79	2	156	166	0361-0470				10.1080/03610470.2020.1795586					FSTA:2021-08-Te3023

Mangaba (Hancornia speciosa Gomes) beverage as an alternative wine.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This work aimed to produce and characterize different alcoholic fermented mangaba beverages and study the storage of the best formulation. Four fermentation formulations were produced for this study. The fermented products were characterized and the best formulation was stored. Physicochemical results showed a statistical difference when comparing the beverages according to their alcohol content, total acidity, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and reduced dry extract. For total phenolic content and antioxidant activity, variations with no statistical difference were found. For the phenolic profile extract, 20 compounds were identified. It was found a decrease in luminosity and fixed acidity during storage as well as an increase in total acidity and volatile acidity. Therefore, it is concluded that the beverages showed great results and glass was the best packaging material to store the mangaba beverage under the studied conditions. Novelty impact statement. Magaba is an interesting raw material for the development of alcoholic beverages, which present a high content of phenolic compounds (more than 15 mg EAG/g for two formulations) and can be stored for 6 months, being a glass bottle the best packaging to store the beverage under the conditions studied. Based on these results, mangaba beverage has an excellent potential to be added as a new product on the drink market. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		de Souza, Weysser Felipe Candido/CAA-1945-2022	Souza, Weysser/0000-0002-8680-520X; DE MAGALHAES CORDEIRO, ANGELA MARIA TRIBUZY/0000-0002-9475-0202; Brito, Isabelle/0000-0003-3295-2420; Almeida, Francisco Lucas Chaves/0000-0001-5349-7645							2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15779					FSTA:2022-03-Hs1947

From solvent extraction to the concurrent extraction of lipids and proteins from green coffee: an eco-friendly approach to improve process feasibility.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					The production of green coffee oil by mechanical pressing of green coffee beans has been precluded by low extraction yields, which generates a protein-rich byproduct (cake) containing variable amounts of lipids. Subsequent utilization of the cake requires the removal of the residual cake oil by solvent extraction. An eco-friendly extraction strategy, using water, enzymes, and mechanical treatments, was evaluated to concurrently extract lipids and proteins from green coffee flour, without the use of harsh solvents. Among the enzymatic treatments evaluated, the use of 0.5% alkaline protease led to higher protein (62.2%) and oil (47.7%) extractability in a shorter time (30 min). This enzymatic treatment was optimized with respect to solids-to-liquid ratio (SLR) (1:17.5-1:7) and concentration of enzyme (0.1-0.9% w/w). Although optimum extraction conditions (1:17.5 SLR and 0.1% enzyme) achieved high protein (70%) and oil (48%) extractability and reduced enzyme use by 80%, a higher water usage was required. Therefore, a two-stage countercurrent extraction was developed to reduce water usage in the process. The countercurrent extraction strategy not only reduced the amount of water used in the process by 60% but promoted higher protein (72%) and oil (58%) extractability, compared with the single-stage process (62.2 and 47.7%, respectively).

Ultrasound-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction based on melting of the donor phase: a new approach for the determination of trace elements in solid samples.		Food Analytical Methods					A novel ultrasound-assisted dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (UA-DLLME) based on melting of the donor phase for the determination of Cd, Cu, and Fe in margarine samples using high-resolution continuum source electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (HR-CS ET AAS) is proposed. Considering that margarine is in the solid phase at room temperature, requiring heat for melting, the microextraction process was assisted by an ultrasonic bath to ensure the melting point of the samples and to increase the extraction efficiency of the analytes by UA-DLLME. After the extraction procedure, the aqueous phase was collected and directly introduced into a graphite furnace. The procedure was applied for extraction and multi-element determination, exploring the strategy of simultaneous and sequential determination of analytes by HR-CS ET AAS. A low volume of nitric acid solution in the presence of ethanol and hydrogen peroxide allowed the metals to be separated from the sample in an aqueous phase with subsequent determination by HR-CS ETAAS. In the extraction procedure, 5.0 g of each margarine sample was sonicated under heating in the presence of 100 muL of a solution containing HNO3 0.1 mol L-1, ethanol (95.1%, v v-1), and H2O2 3% (v v-1) in a volume proportion of 2:1:1. The influences of the time of extraction, temperature of extraction, and amplitude of sonication were examined, and the proposed conditions were as follows: extraction time, 10 min; temperature, 60 °C; and amplitude, 100%. Using 5 g of margarine sample, limits of detection of 0.03,0.52, and 224 ng g-1 were obtained for Cd, Cu, and Fe, respectively. Recovery tests were performed, and the results ranged from 87 to 108% for Cd, 91 to 115% for Cu, and 85 to 112% for Fe. The results obtained by the proposed extraction procedure agreed with those obtained after wet digestion of the sample and determination by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Impact of hydrothermal pretreatments on physicochemical characteristics and drying kinetics of starch from red rice (Oryza sativa L.).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of different hydrothermal pretreatments on the physical chemical characteristics and drying kinetics of red rice starch (Oryza sativa L.) were investigated. The hydrothermal pretreatments chosen include the cooking, autoclave, and steam explosion processes. To obtain the starch in powder form, the pastes were dried at a temperature of 50 °C with an air speed of 1.0 m/s. The mathematical models (empirical and diffusive) were adjusted to the experimental data. The starches were submitted to extraction yield, color, water binding capacity, and proanthocyanidins. The values for the diffusivity are between 3.08*10-7 and 2.74*10-6 m2/min for treatments. The pretreatments of cooking in the grain and autoclave in the starch gave better results than the other studied treatments (formulations), presenting shorter drying time (450 and 510 min) and higher yield (48.60% and 53.54%), respectively. With the application of pretreatments, it is possible to save energy and reduce thermal damage. Novelty impact statement. The results obtained in this study reveals the application autoclave pre-treatment in red rice starch effectively saves energy and reduces thermal damage as the drying time is shortened. In addition, the drying process information can be used when designing future new equipments. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		de Araujo Padilha, Carlos Eduardo/AAO-7796-2020; Monteiro, Shenia Santos/AAU-5685-2020; Santos, Everaldo/L-9475-2014	de Araujo Padilha, Carlos Eduardo/0000-0002-9532-3026; Monteiro, Shenia Santos/0000-0002-7414-1151; Santos, Newton Carlos/0000-0002-9603-2503; Santos, Everaldo/0000-0001-7384-1140							2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15448					FSTA:2021-09-Me5427

Scores selection via Fisher's discriminant power in PCA-LDA to improve the classification of food data.		Food Chemistry					This paper proposes an adaptation of the Fisher's discriminability criterion (named here as discriminant power, DP) for choosing principal components (obtained from Principal Component Analysis, PCA), which will be used to construct supervised Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) models for solving classification problems of food data. The proposed PCA-DP-LDA algorithm was then applied to (i) simulated data, (ii) classify soybean oils with respect to expiration date, and (iii) identify cachaca adulteration with wood extracts that simulated aging. For comparison, PCA-DP-LDA was evaluated against conventional PCA-LDA (based on explained variance) and Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). Among them, PCA-DP-LDA achieved the most parsimonious and interpretable results, with similar or better classification performance. Therefore, the new algorithm can be considered a good alternative to the already well-established discriminant methods, being potentially applied where the discriminability of the principal components may not follow the same behavior of the explained variance.

J		Almeria, S.; Shipley, A.							Detection of Cyclospora cayetanensis on bagged pre-cut salad mixes within their shelf-life and after sell by date by the U.S. food and drug administration validated method.		Food Microbiology					Recently, outbreaks of Cyclospora cayetanensis in the U.S. were linked to the consumption of a variety of salads containing romaine and/or iceberg lettuce, carrots and/or red cabbage. The Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) Chapter 19b method was validated for the detection of C. cayetanensis in carrots, cabbage and romaine lettuce, but has not been previously evaluated in ready-to-eat (RTE) salad mixes. In addition, the only samples available for traceback investigations are sometimes leftovers in bad conditions. This study evaluated the validated BAM method for detection of C. cayetanensis in two different RTE mixed salads (mix 1: romaine and iceberg lettuces, carrots, and red cabbage and mix 2: romaine and iceberg lettuces, carrots, red cabbage, radish, and pea pods) in good condition and after their sell by date. Individual samples (25 g) were seeded with five and 200 C. cayetanensis oocysts. Unseeded produce was used as negative control. The method included washing of the produce, concentration and extraction of C. cayetanensis DNA and molecular detection of C. cayetanensis 18 S rRNA gene. As few as five oocysts were detected in both fresh and after sell by date mix salads. All unseeded samples were negative, and all samples of both salad types seeded with 200 oocysts were positive. In samples seeded with 200 oocysts, average 18 S rRNA C. cayetanensis CT values were significantly higher in fresh salad mix 1 compared to fresh salad mix 2; CT values were significantly higher in the after sell by date salads compared to their respective fresh mixes (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the BAM method was able to detect as few as five oocysts even in after sell by date RTE mix salads. However, the differences in detection observed, highlight the importance of evaluating the performance of the validated C. cayetanensis detection method in different food matrices and conditions, in advance for future outbreak investigations.

J		Almeria, S.; Assurian, A.; Shipley, A.							Modifications of the U.S. food and drug administration validated method for detection of Cyclospora cayetanensis oocysts in prepared dishes: Mexican-style salsas and guacamole.		Food Microbiology					Although multiple outbreak clusters of Cyclospora cayetanensis have been traced back to consumption of dishes in Mexican-style restaurants, the FDA Bacteriological Analytical Manual (BAM) does not currently provide methods to detect C. cayetanensis in dishes that contain multiple produce ingredients, such As salsas and guacamole. These complex food matrices also may contain high levels of fats, which can interfere with the detection. Several modifications to the BAM Chapter 19b method (washing produce, DNA extraction, and a TaqMan real-time PCR assay targeting the 18S rRNA gene of C. cayetanensis) were assessed with the goal to detect as few as 5 oocysts of C. cayetanensis in 25 g samples of commercial salsa/pico de gallo, guacamole, and salsa verde. Both freshly prepared and frozen versions of these foods were seeded with 5,10 and 200 oocysts. For salsa samples, using a gentler washing step than recommended by BAM, we achieved detection of 5 oocysts in the samples (81.8%, n=11). Increasing the amount of Alconox in the wash solution to 1%, rather than the 0.1% used in BAM, and adjusting the DNA extraction protocol to process large wash pellets, enabled detection of 5 oocysts in guacamole. To reach the desired level of detection in salsa verde, two types of modifications were necessary: gentler washing and DNA extraction modifications. The use of these same method modifications on previously frozen food samples, provided levels of detection similar to those achieved with fresh dishes. Our modifications enabled robust and reproducible detection of C. cayetanensis in multi-ingredient Mexican dishes, detecting as few as 5 oocysts in 25 g samples. Validating and deploying effective methods to detect C. cayetanensis in high risk fresh produce and prepared dishes are critically important for prevalence studies and outbreak investigations of this parasite.

J		Almiron, P.; Escobar, F. B.; Pathak, A.; Spence, C.; Velasco, C.							Searching for the sound of premium beer.		Food Quality and Preference					One common definition of premiumness is as a higher quality and more expensive variant of a product than other members of the category or reference class. Premiumness can effectively be conveyed by means of different sensory cues (e.g., colours, sounds, weight). However, to date, research linking the sound of a product's packaging with premiumness is sparse. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that consumers associate different levels of beer premiumness with the sounds of opening and pouring of bottles and cans. We report the results of two online experiments. Experiment 1 explored the effect of two sound properties associated with beer can and bottle opening and pouring (sound pressure and frequency) on the perception of premiumness. Experiment 2 used semantic differential scales (e.g., bad-good, passive-active) to evaluate the meanings people tend to associate with different auditory cues. The analyses revealed that participants perceived: 1) bottle sounds to be more premium overall than can sounds, 2) pouring sounds as more premium than opening sounds, and 3) higher pressure sounds as more premium than lower pressure sounds. Additionally, premiumness was positively correlated with semantic differentials of dead-alive, and the evaluative terms of sad-happy, awful-nice, and bad-good, which highlights the perceived quality and premium character of a beer when conveyed auditorily.

J		Almoraie, N. M.; Shatwan, I. M.							Effect of camel milk on the physicochemical, rheological, and sensory qualities of bread.		Journal of Food Quality					An increase in bread production has been achieved to meet the increasing demand of the growing population. During the manufacturing process, refined wheat flour, the main ingredient for bread making, loses its nutritional qualities. Hence, it is necessary to use additional nutritional sources to maintain nutritional value. In this study, the rheological, physicochemical, and sensory qualities of bread, prepared using camel milk and water, were evaluated. The increase in the camel milk content resulted in the significant increase in the protein, oil, and ash contents of bread and a decrease in the carbohydrate content. The protein content was increased from 11.95% (100% water) to 14.01% (100% camel milk). The use of camel milk resulted in the progressive increase in the content of two essential fatty acids, alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid (; maximum increase: 1.65% and 20.9%, resp.). The rheological properties of bread (peak viscosity, gelatinisation temperature, and water absorption capacity) could be improved using camel milk. However, reduced dough stability and peak viscosity-temperature were also observed. The increase in the water absorption capacity from 61% to 67% indicated that the supplemented dough was more suitable than the original dough for preparing bread. The physical properties of bread prepared using camel milk (30%) and water (70%) were better than the properties of the control bread sample. Improved sensory attributes were observed under these formulation conditions. Bread containing ≥70% camel milk received lower sensory scores. The results indicated that the use of the formulation consisting of camel milk (30%) and water (70%) could enhance the nutritional value of bread without significantly affecting the acceptability. The results can provide a platform for extending the application of camel milk, primarily used to produce fermented milk, in the food industry. It could be potentially used to address the global problem of acute malnutrition. Copyright © 2021 Noha M. Almoraie and Israa M. Shatwan.

J		Almqvist, V.; Berg, C.; Hultgren, J.							Reliability of remote post-mortem veterinary meat inspections in pigs using augmented-reality live-stream video software.		Food Control					Official meat inspections at remotely situated, small-scale slaughter houses and game handlings establishments fare associated with a relatively high cost of official control per inspected animal. By performing veterinary meat inspections via live-streamed video, this cost could be lowered. We aimed to evaluate how veterinary meat inspections at slaughter can be conducted remotely with the help of a camera-equipped non-veterinary technician on site. Specialized software and augmented reality technology were used. The remote inspection was compared to standard on-site veterinary meat inspection at a large-scale slaughter plant for pigs in Sweden during 2019. The remote and on-site inspectors recorded findings in 400 carcasses and organs arrested for further inspection. The comparison was based primarily on percentage agreement, Cohen's kappa and prevalence-and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) as measures of agreement and reliability. The remote method was shown to display a high level of agreement for clear, easily distinguished findings (e.g.tail lesions, with an agreement of 92.3%, Cohen's kappa of 0.77 and PABAK of 0.85). For more vague findings and subjective decisions, the performance was slightly lower (e.g.whether or not to condemn a carcass completely, with agreement 75.2%, Cohen's kappa 0.32 and PABAK 0.50). Remote inspection appears to constitute a viable alternative for post-mortem meat inspection in pigs, given a sufficiently standardized method of inspection and sufficient inspection times. The performance of remote inspection probably depends on which persons use the method.

Laser light as a promising approach to improve the nutritional value, antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory activity of flavonoid-rich buckwheat sprouts.		Food Chemistry					Buckwheat sprouts are rich in several nutrients such as antioxidant flavonoids that have a positive impact on human health. Although there are several studies reported the positive impact of laser light on crop plants, no studies have applied laser light to enhance the nutritive values of buckwheat sprouts. Herein, the contents of health-promoting minerals, metabolites and enzymes as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities were determined in laser-treated (He-Ne laser, 632 nm, 5 mW) common buckwheat (CBW) and tartary buckwheat (TBW) sprouts. Out of 49 targeted minerals, vitamins, pigments and antioxidants, more than 35 parameters were significantly increased in CBW and/or TBW sprouts by laser light treatment. Also, laser light boosted the antioxidant capacity and anti-inflammatory activities through inhibiting cyclooxygenase-2 and lipoxygenase activities, particularly in TBW sprouts. Accordingly, laser light could be recommended as a promising method to improve the nutritional and health-promoting values of buckwheat sprouts. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Almutairi, B.; Turner, M. S.; Fletcher, M. T.; Sultanbawa, Y.							The impact of commercial prebiotics on the growth, survival and nisin production by Lactococcus lactis 537 in milk.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this work we investigated the potential of a new dairy-based fermented food which contains a nisin producing Lactococcus lactis strain with biopreservative function and a prebiotic. Lc lactis 537 was incubated in ultrahigh temperature (UHT) skim milk in the presence of 8 different commercially available prebiotics (inulin, fructooligosaccharide, xylooligosaccharide, lactulose, gum arabic, maltodextrin, isomaltooligosaccharides, galactooligosaccharides) at 3% concentration. The growth of Lc. lactis 537 was found to be enhanced in the presence of inulin only, as compared to in milk without prebiotic. Acidification was minimal, with all milks with or without prebiotic remaining above pH 6. Survival during storage for 14 days at 4 °C was high with or without prebiotic, with less than a 1-log CFU/mL reduction in viability seen. Antimicrobial production by Lc. lactis 537 was evaluated and found to be significantly higher when cells were grown in the presence of inulin. A nisB mutant of Lc. lactis 537 did not have any antimicrobial activity with or without prebiotic, thus demonstrating the effect was due to nisin. The findings of this study suggest that inulin is the most promising prebiotic inclusion for the development of a milk-based symbiotic product containing Lc. lactis 537.

J		Alok Sagar, N.; Sunil Pareek							Fortification of multigrain flour with onion skin powder as a natural preservative: effect on quality and shelf life of the bread.		Food Bioscience					Production of functional food with a higher shelf life is one of the major concerns for the food industry. The present study aims to improve the shelf life, phenolics, and flavonoids content, and antioxidant power of multigrain bread (MGB) by adding onion skin powder (OSP) as a natural preservative. Whole wheat flour (60%) and 9 multigrain flour (40%) were mixed with OSP at 1, 2, 3, or 4% to give 4 different multigrain functional breads along with control (without OSP). Products were analyzed for total phenols, flavonoids, antioxidant activity and, textural, and sensory attributes. The total viable count was also investigated for shelf life comparison of bread during ambient 28 2 °C and refrigerated 5 2 °C storage conditions. Texture analysis showed that the hardness and chewiness decreased with the addition of OSP while sensory evaluation showed 3% OSP MGB as highly preferred in terms of flavor, color, mouthfeel, and overall acceptability. A significant increase in total phenols and total flavonoids was observed in the OSP enriched samples. Antioxidant assays showed that 4% OSP MGB had the highest DPPH* (53.1 0.3) %, ABTS.+ (39.4 0.3) % and FRAP activity (38.8 0.4 mumol gallic acid equivalents/g) while the control was the lowest. A storage study showed that the shelf life of OSP enriched MGB was extended up to 11 and 13 days with ambient and refrigerated conditions, respectively. Refrigeration was observed to be more effective than room temperature in extending the shelf life of the products.

Outer-dried skins of fifteen prominent onion cultivars from India were selected for the study. A comparative study was done for proximate profiling, thermal characteristics, functional grouping, and mineral contents. Skin of cv. "NHRDF Red" contained the highest amount of crude protein (5.970.15g/100g), ash (12.240.59g/100g), and fiber (8.280.20g/100g), whereas cv. "Pusa Red" possessed the highest amount of total fat (0.470.02g/100g) and the maximum carbohydrates (76.660.56g/100g) were found in "Pusa Riddhi. " Mineral analysis showed that cv. "NHRDF Red" had the maximum concentration of all 9 minerals along with sulphur content. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis explored the various metabolites present in each cultivar. The thermal analysis explored cv. "Agrifound Dark Red" as highly thermally stable having 70.98% residual mass. The lowest Tg temperature range was found between 64.4 °C and 90.6 °C for "Agrifound Dark Red. " Skin of cv. "NHRDF Red" was reported as the best source of protein, fiber, and minerals, which may be utilized for developing a food product.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Ultrasound assisted extraction (UAE) technique was employed for the extraction of phytochemicals from Coccinia indica fruit. Twenty-two compounds were identified post extraction process by GCMS analysis. Temperature, time of extraction, solvent concentration and solid-solvent (SS) ratio were considered as important process parameters for UAE. Response surface method was applied for optimizing the extraction process. The study focussed on the yield of extract, antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS), total phenolic content and total flavonoid content as the dependent variables. The optimum values of process parameters were obtained to be 30 °C temperature, 42 min of extraction time, 63% solvent (ethanol) concentration and SS ratio of 1:60. At these optimum conditions, the extract yield was 18.58%. The DPPH activity of 83.42%, 27.18% ABTS radical scavenging ability, 12.82 mg Gallic acid equivalent (GAE) /g of phenolic content and 79.81 mg Rutin equivalent (RE)/g of flavonoid content were obtained. Major compounds identified by GCMS were rutin, naringenin, apigenin and kaempferol.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Beverage fortification with phytochemicals can be done by nanocarriers to improve solubility and stability. A functional beverage was prepared from sattu (roasted Bengal gram powder) in limewater. Rutin loaded pectin nanoparticles (RLPN), calcium and riboflavin were added as fortificant. The encapsulation efficiency and yield of RLPN was 90.23% and 69.64%, respectively. The hydrophilic property, solubility and antioxidant activity of rutin was improved after being loaded on the pectin nanoparticles. The pH, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, protein content and calcium content of fortified beverage was 4.42-4.46,7.60-9.20 °Brix, 0.480%-0.496% Lactic acid, 2,294.957-2,393.470 mg bovine serum albumin/L and 412.269-420.117 mg/L, respectively. Isobolographic analysis was done to study the interaction between ingredients, additives and fortificant. RLPN showed a synergistic effect with sattu powder and citric acid while antagonistic behavior was observed with riboflavin. Fortified sattu beverage can be an alternative to the existing protein beverages. Novelty impact statement. Sattu (roasted Bengal gram flour) is a staple food in many parts of Indian subcontinent. It is a high protein food which is easily digested. This research work is aimed toward the formulation, optimization and analysis of the fortified sattu beverage. The incorporation of RLPN has increased the antioxidant potential and the use of limewater has elevated the calcium content. The appearance of the beverage is also appealing to the consumers due to the addition of riboflavin. These characteristics are sought by food processing industries nowadays in the recent food products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15964					FSTA:2022-03-Hs1950

In vitro digestion nullified the differences triggered by roasting in phenolic composition and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory capacity of coffee.		Food Chemistry					Coffee beans were roasted to medium, dark and very dark degrees, and respective brews were in vitro digested and tested for alpha-glucosidase inhibition, to explore their antidiabetic potential. Phenolic acids (PA) and Maillard reaction indices (MRI) were quantified before and after digestion. Molecular docking was carried out to investigate alpha-glucosidase inhibition mechanisms. In vitro digested coffee inhibited alpha-glucosidase more effectively, compared to undigested samples, but without differences between roasting degrees. The inhibitory effect may be attributed to chlorogenic acids (CGA), which were the most abundant PA in digested coffees. In fact, molecular docking predicted a high affinity of CGA for alpha-glucosidase. Even though digestion nullified roasting-induced differences in alpha-glucosidase inhibition, CGA showed a decreasing trend upon digestion. Similarly, MRI did not differ among coffees upon digestion but decreased compared to undigested samples. Overall, the results reported in this study suggest that the presence of different compounds in coffee matrix may contribute to an antidiabetic effect. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Reformulation and food combination as strategies to modulate glycaemia: the case of apple pomace containing biscuits administered with apple juice to healthy rats.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Conventional (CB) and apple-pomace-reformulated (RB) biscuits were administered to healthy rats. Although the areas under curve (AUC) of glucose concentration were comparable between samples, differences in the glycaemic profile of CB and RB were observed. RB caused an initial steeper increase in glycaemia but a shift in the glycaemic peak from 45 to 60 min, as compared to CB. When CB or RB was ingested with apple juice (AJ) no differences were observed as compared to their ingestion with a soft drink (SD) simulating AJ sugar content, indicating that reformulation, more than the presence of AJ, was crucial in affecting the glycaemic response. Consumer acceptability towards reformulation was assessed through conjoint analysis, by simulating labels reporting information on reformulation. Consumers preferred information generally referring to the health-promoting effect (i.e. "low sugar" and "high fibre" contents), despite directly relating to a specific disease (i.e. "suitable for diabetics" and "low glycaemic index"). © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					Industrial canneries are subject to perturbations that may compromise food safety requirements. In such cases, plant operators typically increase the processing time, leading to undesirable large processing cycles and excessive quality degradation. In addition, differences among the items in a batch lead to variability in terms of quality and safety which, if not explicitly considered in the processing strategy, forces the use of conservative operation policies. In this work, we present an event-based dynamic optimization approach that combines available plant measurements and mathematical model predictions to anticipate the effect of plant perturbations on food safety. A safety software sensor is build upon an on-line predictive simulation and a previous food-variability characterization such that, if any perturbation during the sterilization compromises food safety, a new processing strategy that optimizes a trade off among quality, uniformity and processing time is recomputed and implemented. Such multi-objective dynamic optimization problem under food product variability is efficiently addressed by taking advantage of the monotonicity and convexity properties of the food quality/safety dynamics.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Model yolk-based (10% v/v) gels with different concentrations of kappa-carrageenan (0-2% w/w) were characterised employing rheological measurements, textural analysis and scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, the effect of the microstructure of the model gels on the growth rate of Staphylococcus was also evaluated. In all cases, the nature of the gel was dominated by the elastic component, specifically, 1.5, 1.75 and 2% kappa-carrageenan samples can be described as "true gels" (tan delta< 0.1). Maximum strength of the interactions between rheological units (A) was observed with 1.75% kappa-carrageenan (4.740.38 kPa), which indicates that the strength of interactions was determined not only by kappa-carrageenan concentration, but also by the amount of yolk. Finally, an inverse linear correlation was found between the maximum specific growth rate of Staphylococcus and rheological data (R2> 0.99). © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Incidence of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus sporothermodurans and Geobacillus stearothermophilus in ultra-high temperature milk and biofilm formation capacity of isolates.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The presence of mesophilic and thermophilic spore-forming bacteria in UHT milk, as well as biofilm formation in dairy plants, are concerning. The current study explored the spore-forming bacilli diversity in 100 samples of UHT milk (skimmed and whole). Through this work, a total of 239 isolates from UHT milk samples were obtained. B. cereus s. s. was isolated from 7 samples, B. sporothermodurans from 19 and, G. stearothermophilus from 25 samples. Genes encoding hemolysin (HBL), and non-hemolytic (NHE) enterotoxins were detected in B. cereus s. s. isolates. All isolates of B. cereus s. s. (12) B. sporothermodurans (38), and G. stearothermophilus (47) were selected to verify the ability of biofilm formation in microtiter plates. The results showed all isolates could form biofilms. The OD595 values of biofilm formation varied between 0.14 and 1.04 for B. cereus, 0.20 to 1.87 for B. sporothermodurans, and 0.49 to 2.77 for G. stearothermophilus. The data highlights that the dairy industry needs to reinforce control in the initial quality of the raw material and in CIP cleaning procedures; avoiding biofilm formation and consequently a persistent microbiota in processing plants, which can shelter pathogenic species such as B. cereus s. s.

Subcritical water as hydrolytic medium to recover and fractionate the protein fraction and phenolic compounds from craft brewer's spent grain.		Food Chemistry					The valorization of the brewer's spent grain (BSG) generated in a craft beer industry was studied by subcritical water hydrolysis in a semi-continuous fixed-bed reactor. Temperature was varied from 125 to 185 °C at a constant flow rate of 4 mL/min. Biomass hydrolysis yielded a maximum of 78% of solubilized protein at 185 °C. Free amino acids presented a maximum level at 160 °C with a value of 55 mg free amino acids/gprotein-BSG. Polar amino acid presented a maximum at lower temperatures than non-polar amino acids. The maximum in total phenolic compounds was reached at 185 °C. This maximum is the same for aldehyde phenolic compounds such as vanillin, syringic and protocatechuic aldehyde; however, for hydroxycinnamic acids, such as ferulic acid and p-coumaric, the maximum was obtained at 160 °C. This allows a fractionation of the bioactive compounds. Subcritical water addresses opportunities for small breweries to be incorporated within the biorefinery concept.

Food Control					Metabolomic fingerprinting of virgin olive oil (VOO) by1H NMR spectroscopy was used to study its stability during storage simulating normal shelf life conditions during its commercialization. A representative set of VOOs covering the full range of possible chemical compositions were exposed to light (500 lux for 12 h/day) at 25 °C for 12 months or stored in the dark at 25 °C, 30 °C and 35 °C for 24 months. Multivariate data analysis of the 1H NMR spectra of the oil samples provided classification models to evaluate VOO freshness and to verify the light exposure of the VOO during storage, as well as regression models to determine VOO storage time and tentatively the best before date of a fresh VOO. These predictive models disclosed the chemical compounds responsible for the compositional changes in VOO due to hydrolytic and oxidative degradation taking place during its storage, and confirmed that light and increasing temperature enhance these processes. The presence of characteristic resonances of hydroperoxides (primary oxidation products) and the decrease of1H signals assigned to phenolic compounds, mainly secoiridoid derivatives, and other minor compounds such as fatty acids, squalene and native (E)-2-hexenal present in fresh VOO revealed its oxidative degradation. Further, the emergence of low intensity1H signals of saturated aldehydes meant that the secondary oxidation process has started at a low rate and yield. Moreover, the decrease of the1H signals of triacylglycerides and sn-1,2-diacylglycerides, and the increase of sn-1,3-diacylglycerides indicated that hydrolytic degradation of VOO and diacylglyceride isomerisation was occurring.1H NMR fingerprint of VOO together with pattern recognition techniques afford relevant information to assess the quality of VOOs taking into consideration legal, sensory and health-promoting aspects.

Food Chemistry					An ultrasensitive, rapid, and specific method for Ochratoxin A (OTA) detection was designed using complementary sequence to aptamer as a target of molecular beacon (MB). The designed loop structure of the MB has the same sequence as the aptamer with a complementary DNA (cDNA) which translates the level of the target into a measurable response. The presence of the target holds aptamer at the corresponding amount and the additional cDNAs are consumed by unbound aptamers which avails free cDNAs that resulting in fluorescence rising due to unfolding of MBs. Under the optimized conditions, the fluorescence intensity increased linearly with OTA concentration over the range of 10 pg mL-1-1 g mL-1 with the detection limit of 0.247 pg mL-1. The application of this assay in wheat sample in comparison with HPLC-MS/MS method, demonstrated that the new assay could be a potential sensing platform for OTA detection.

Impact of storing condition on staling and microbial spoilage behavior of bread and their contribution to prevent food waste.		Foods					The high loss rate of bread is generally known to contribute to the alarmingly high numbers in worldwide food waste. Correct storage techniques are believed to enable the reduction of preventable food waste. Therefore, the influence of storage parameters on staling and spoilage behavior of German bread within the limits of common household methods was investigated in this study. The aim was to generate reliable data for staling and spoilage using different storage methods (PE-layered microperforated paper bag, plastic bag, and fridge and bread box) to bridge the gap between consumer's needs and scientific research questions. Everyday routines of life, such as visual inspection, were compared with microbiological techniques and were found to represent an adequate tool for microbial safety control. Visually undetectable fungal growth has not been found to result in the production of mycotoxins (fumonisins B1 and B2 and ochratoxin A) in quantifiable or harmful concentrations. Thus, disgust should prevent any foodborne health risks as the visual appearance should lead to avoiding the consumption of spoiled food before mycotoxins are produced in amounts causing adverse health effects within the limits of this experimental setup. Additionally, the storage temperature especially was found to influence the kinetics of staling processes, as a reduction accelerated the staling process. Further, crumb moisture loss was found to contradict a long shelf life but, on the other hand, an elevated humidity was shown to provoke excessive microbial growth and should therefore be observed when designing suitable storage methods. Further, the correct choice of the bread type stored and a good sanitary practice represent simply accessible ways to prolong the storage period of bread loaves. © 2021 by the authors.

Enrichment of fermented cassava meal "Mchuchume" with micronutrient ingredients from soya bean flour and Moringa oleifera leaves powder.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. "Mchuchume" is a ready to eat fermented cassava food used for breakfast, lunch, and/or snack purposes. Its diverse consumption modes attract many studies, including regarding its fortification with inexpensive food materials rich in beneficial nutritional qualities. This study is aimed at investigating the effect of soya bean flour and Moringa oleifera leaves powder on the micronutrient composition of mchuchume. Results. Enrichment significantly increased iron (0.001gkg-1 in control to 0.03gkg-1 in cassava-soya, 0.06gkg-1 in cassava-moringa and 0.09gkg-1 in cassava-soya-moringa) and potassium (1.01gkg-1 in control to 5.14gkg-1 in cassava-soya, 3.45gkg-1 in cassava-moringa and 7.43gkg-1 in cassava-soya-moringa). Compared with the control (0.10gkg-1 sodium), sodium content either decreased significantly (to 0.09gkg-1 in cassava-soya) or increased significantly (to 0.37gkg-1 in cassava-moringa and 0.36gkg-1 in cassava-soya-moringa). beta-Carotene was below the instrument's limit of detection (<0.2*10-6 gmL-1) in the control and cassava-soya blends but was detected in cassava-moringa (0.01-0.02gkg-1) and cassava-soya-moringa blends (0.01-0.02gkg-1). Conclusion. Mchuchume fortified with both M. oleifera leaves powder and soya bean flour has micronutrients at recommended dietary allowances. The food is recommended for use in management of iron and vitamin A deficiencies, which are endemic not only to inhabitants and refugees of the Kigoma region in Tanzania but also to people in most African countries and other cassava-consuming developing nations. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3575	3581	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10984					FSTA:2021-10-Ge4926
J		Alpos, M.; Sze Ying Leong; Oey, I.							Combined effects of calcium addition and thermal processing on the texture and in vitro digestibility of starch and protein of black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).		Foods					Legumes are typically soaked overnight to reduce antinutrients and then cooked prior to consumption. However, thermal processing can cause over-softening of legumes. This study aimed to determine the effect of calcium addition (0, 100, 300, and 500 ppm in the form of calcium chloride, CaCl2), starting from the overnight soaking step, in reducing the loss of firmness of black beans during thermal processing for up to 2 h. The impact of calcium addition on the in vitro starch and protein digestibility of cooked beans was also assessed. Two strategies of calcium addition were employed in this study: (Strategy 1/S1) beans were soaked and then cooked in the same CaCl2 solution, or (Strategy 2/S2) cooked in a freshly prepared CaCl2 solution after the calcium-containing soaking medium was discarded. Despite the texture degradation of black beans brought about by increasing the cooking time, texture profile analysis (TPA) revealed that their hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, chewiness, and resilience improved significantly (p< 0.05) with increasing calcium concentration. Interestingly, beans cooked for 2 h with 300 ppm CaCl2 shared similar hardness with beans cooked for 1 h without calcium addition. Starch and protein digestibility of calcium-treated beans generally improved with prolonged cooking. However, calcium-treated beans cooked for 1 h under S2 achieved a reduced texture loss and a lower starch digestibility than those beans treated in S1. A lower starch digestion could be desired as this reflects a slow rise in blood glucose levels. Findings from this result also showed that treating black beans with high level of CaCl2 (i.e., 500 ppm) was not necessary, otherwise this would limit protein digestibility of cooked black beans. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alpos, M.; Sze Ying Leong; Liesaputra, V.; Martin, C. E.; Oey, I.							Understanding in vivo mastication behaviour and in vitro starch and protein digestibility of pulsed electric field-treated black beans after cooking.		Foods					The aim of this study was to understand (i) the in vivo mastication behaviour of cooked black beans (chewing duration, texture perception, oral bolus particle size, microstructure, and salivary alpha-amylase) and (ii) the in vitro digestibility of starch and protein of in vivo-generated black bean oral bolus under simulated gastrointestinal condition. The beans were pre-treated using pulsed electric field (PEF) with and without calcium chloride (CaCl2) addition prior to cooking. The surface response model based on least square was used to optimise PEF processing condition in order to achieve the same texture properties of cooked legumes except for chewiness. In vivo mastication behaviour of the participants (n = 17) was characterized for the particle size of the resulting bolus, their salivary alpha-amylase activity, and the total chewing duration before the bolus was deemed ready for swallowing. In vitro starch and protein digestibility of the masticated bolus generated in vivo by each participant along the gastrointestinal phase were then studied. This study found two distinct groups of chewers-fast and slow chewers who masticated all black bean beans, on average, for 25 and 29 s, respectively, to achieve a bolus ready for swallowing. Longer durations of chewing resulted in boluses with small-sized particles (majorly composed of a higher number of broken-down cotyledons (2-5mm2 particle size), fewer seed coats (5-13mm2 particle size)), and higher activity of alpha-amylase. Therefore, slow chewers consistently exhibited a higher in vitro digestibility of both the starch and protein of processed black beans compared to fast chewers. Despite such distinct difference in the nutritional implication for both groups of chewers, the in vivo masticated oral bolus generated by fast chewers revealed that the processing conditions involving the PEF and addition of CaCl2 of black beans appeared to significantly (p< 0.05) enhance the in vitro digestibility of protein (by two-fold compared to untreated samples) without stimulating a considerable increase in the starch digestibility. These findings clearly demonstrated that the food structure of cooked black beans created through PEF treatment combined with masticatory action has the potential to modulate a faster hydrolysis of protein during gastrointestinal digestion, thus offering an opportunity to upgrade the quality of legume protein intake in the daily diet. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In this study, various ratios of combined red, blue, and amber light-emitting diodes (rbaLEDs) were investigated for their effect on the expression of carotenoid biosynthetic genes and carotenoid accumulation in eight Brassica microgreens. Total and individual (beta-carotene, lutein, alpha-carotene, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin) carotenoids were increased 20-44 and 10-55%, respectively, under dose-dependent increasing amber-blue light and decreasing red in most microgreens. Lipophilic 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and ferric reducing antioxidant power antioxidant activities were significantly increased under higher amber and blue light fractions, while oxygen radical absorbance capacity was generally decreased. Under rbaLED in mizuna (B. rapa) microgreens, the lycopene epsilon cyclase (LYCepsilon) expression was 10-15-fold higher, which resulted in downstream accumulation of alpha-carotene and lutein. Lycopene beta cyclase (LYCbeta) was not significantly changed, suggesting that beta-carotene, violaxanthin and neoxanthin were mainly controlled by upstream phytoene synthase and branch-point LYCepsilon. Increased beta-ring carotenoid hydroxylase (CHXbeta) expression was also consistent with lutein accumulation. This study demonstrated for the first time that amber LED was involved in the regulatory mechanism of carotenoid biosynthesis, thus a potential novel approach to production of antioxidant-rich microgreens.

J		Alrobaish, W. S.; Jacxsens, L.; Luning, P. A.; Vlerick, P.							Food integrity climate in food businesses: conceptualization, development, and validation of a self-assessment tool.		Foods					Current scientific research and industry guidelines focus on food safety, aiming to reduce unintentional food contaminations through technological and managerial measures. Due to the deceptive nature of food fraud, the fight to prevent intentional food adulteration and counterfeiting threats requires an approach that goes beyond the common food safety-based strategies and falls into the sphere of food integrity. With food integrity being an emerging discipline, a definition was proposed and the concept of food integrity climate was introduced. A food integrity climate (FIC) self-assessment tool in the form of a questionnaire, with twenty indicators and a five-point Likert rating scale was developed, expert-validated, and tested in practice in a large-scale meat distribution company. The questionnaire was designed to measure the performance level of food integrity in food businesses along the supply chain through managers' and operators' perceptions. Minor but interesting differences were found in the food integrity climate perceived between managers and operators as well as among the company's affiliates. The tool helps food businesses to get a deeper insight on the human dimension behind food integrity through the assessment of five climate components in relation to four food integrity elements, identifying strengths and weaknesses regarding a company's food integrity climate. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alsafra, Z.; Scholl, G.; Eppe, G.							Optimization and validation of HS-SPME-GC-MS for the determination of furan and alkylfurans in chocolate-based products: impact of tempering and laser printing.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Furan and its alkyl substituted (2-methylfuran, 3-methylfuran, 2,3-dimethylfuran, 2,5-dimethylfuran) are found in a range between ppm to sub-ppb levels in many foodstuffs undergoing heat treatments like coffee, chicory, or even chocolate. Objectives. Two major objectives are presented. First, we aim at optimizing and validating a HS-SPME-GC-MS method for the quantification of five alkylfurans in chocolate. Second, we focus our study on measuring the quantitative impact of engraving technique on the formation of furan and its derivatives in chocolate, from the raw callets to processed end-products. Method. HS-SPME-GC-MS method operating in SIM mode and using isotope dilution technique with deuterated homologue internal standards was used to quantify alkylfurans in chocolate. Results. Good repeatability (RSD% = 0.1-8%, in duplicate) and intermediate precision (RSD% = 1.7-7%, n = 6) were obtained for these five process contaminants at 10, 25, and 50 g/kg. Trueness was varying between 81 and 109%. LoQ ranged from 0.48 to 2.50 g/kg. Relative expanded measurement uncertainties ranged from 6 to 30%. Finally, tempering is responsible for a 24% increase in furan contamination, while the laser engraving technique results in an additional 31% increase in furan. A similar trend was also observed for 2-methylfuran and 3-methylfuran, whereas no significant increases were observed for 2,3-dimethylfuran and 2,5-dimethylfuran. Conclusions and highlights. A reliable and sensitive method of HS-SPME-GC-MS was reported for the first time for the analysis of furan and four alkylfurans in chocolate. This paper demonstrated that engraving using laser-based techniques can increase the levels of these compounds by up to 30%. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020. All rights reserved.

J		Alsalman, F. B.; Hosahalli S. Ramaswamy							Changes in carbohydrate quality of high-pressure treated aqueous aquafaba.		Food Hydrocolloids					Aquafaba is the water residue of cooked chickpeas. Aquafaba's main constituents are carbohydrates and proteins which are responsible for the structural-functional properties in food. The focus of this research was to enhance carbohydrate functionality and digestibility by high pressure (HP) treatment. Specifically, the target was to increase starch digestibility and crystallinity, and formation of resistant starch, and finally to enhance the elastic modulus G′ and consistency coefficient. HP treatment (227-573 MPa for 6-24 min) was applied on aquafaba slurry prepared from different concentrations of freeze dried aquafaba and water (11-29%; w/w). A response surface methodology was used for the experimental design and the results were compared with those from untreated aquafaba. HP treatment increased consistency coefficient as well as G. The increase in G′ and decrease in tan delta, indicate a structure enhancement by HP treatment resulting in a more cohesive gel network. HP treatment also enhanced starch digestibility and increased resistant starch content significantly from 24.3 to 26.9% (RDS), 0.8-4.1% (SDS), 25.1-31.5% (TDS), and 3.8-4.4% (RS).

J		Alshammari, J.; Dhowlaghar, N.; Yucen Xie; Jie Xu; Juming Tang; Shyam Sablani; Mei-Jun Zhu							Survival of Salmonella and Enterococcus faecium in high fructose corn syrup and honey at room temperature (22 °C).		Food Control					Salmonellosis has been frequently associated with the consumption of high-sugar, low-moisture foods. Honey and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are widely used liquid sugars that are added as humectants in low-moisture foods. The objective of this study was to determine the ability of Salmonella and its presumable surrogate, Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354, to survive in honey and HFCS during storage at room temperature (~22 °C). Using freeze-dried and lawn grown bacteria, the survival of Salmonella and E. faecium in honey and HFCS was determined. Regardless of the inoculation methods, more than 5 log10 reductions were observed in both bacteria in honey and HFCS after 21-days of storage at 22 °C. The pathogens and surrogate in honey and HFCS fell below the detectable limit after 28-days of storage. Thus, the tested bacteria are not able to survive in honey and HFCS over one-month storage at room temperature. The similar level of bacterial reduction in honey and HFCS in storage suggests that the main cause was not the commonly perceived antimicrobial agents in honey. In addition to high acidity of these liquid sugars, the extremely high osmotic pressure is likely the main reason for bacterial death in honey and HFCS during storage. The data provided useful information in developing effective microbial-safe strategies to be incorporated in the preparation or storage of low-moisture food and ingredients.

Toxins					The detection of Ochratoxin A (OTA) in the milk of ruminants occurs infrequently and at low levels, but its occurrence may be higher in dairy products such as cheese. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of OTA in cheeses purchased in the metropolitan city of Bologna (Italy) and the surrounding area. For the analysis, a LC-MS/MS method with a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 1 g/kg was used. OTA was detected in seven out of 51 samples of grated hard cheese (concentration range 1.3-22.4 g/kg), while it was not found in the 33 cheeses of other types which were also analysed. These data show a low risk of OTA contamination for almost all types of cheese analysed. To improve the safety of cheese marketed in grated form, more regulations on cheese rind, which is the part most susceptible to OTA-producing moulds, should be implemented or, alternatively, producers should consider not using the rind as row material for grated cheese. It would be interesting to continue these investigations particularly on grated hard cheeses to have more data to update the risk assessment of OTA in cheese, as also suggested by EFSA in its 2020 scientific opinion on OTA. © 2021 by the authors.

J.; Mandeep Kaur							Assessment of the potential use of MALDI-TOF MS for the identification of bacteria associated with chilled vacuum-packaged lamb meat.		Meat Science					The focus of this study was to compare the effectiveness of MALDI-TOF MS and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing for the identification of bacteria isolated from VP lamb meat stored chilled at 5 °C for 21 days, at the same time gaining insights into bacterial changes over time. The identity of bacterial isolates on non-selective and selective agars was determined by both methods and results compared. Results showed that total bacterial numbers increased over the 21 days (as expected) with Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas (day 0) being replaced by Carnobacterium, Brochothrix and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family by day 21. A high level of agreement (86-100%) for bacterial isolates' identity at genus level was observed between MALDI-TOF MS and partial 16S rRNA gene-based sequencing for isolates where identification was possible. With its cheaper cost and faster turnaround time, once optimized, MALDI-TOF MS could become a useful alternative to 16S rRNA gene-sequencing for the rapid identification of red meat bacterial isolates.

Food Microbiology					In this study we investigated the effect of the single strain in stabilization of type I sourdough microbial associations by crossing six different Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis with five Kazachstania humilis strains. Furthermore, we compared three predictive models, Zwitwering based on Gompertz's equation, Baranyi and Roberts' function and Schiraldi's function to evaluate which one best fitted the experimental data in determining the behaviour of co-cultivated microorganisms. Specific growth rates (mum) and lag time (lambda) values for each mixed population were assessed. Results showed that the different F. sanfranciscensis strains significantly steer the growth kinetics within the pair and affect the ratio bacterial/yeast cells, as data analysis confirmed, whereas K. humilis accommodates to the bacterial strain. To compare the growth models, Root Mean Square (RMS) values were calculated for each predicted curve by implementing an algorithm based on an iterative process to minimize the deviation among observed and calculated data. Schiraldi's function performed better than the others, revealing, on average, the smallest RMS values and providing the best fitting for over 70% of co-cultivation experiments. Models prove to be consistent in predicting growth kinetics of microbial consortia too. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Four Bacillus coagulans strains were isolated from plant-based sources and screened for heat resistance, in vitro probiotic properties and toxicological characteristics and compared with B. coagulans GBI-30,6086. These strains survived high temperatures and low pH, were resistant to bile and lysozyme, were able to produce biofilm, had antimicrobial activity, and were antibiotic-sensitive. All strains had the properties of adhesion, auto-and co-aggregation, although the level of each varied and with incubation time. The safety of these strains was confirmed as no enterotoxin genes (bceT, ces, entFM and cytK) were present and enterotoxins (Hbl, and nhe) were not detected. Hemolytic activity and lecithinase production did not occur. These results indicate that isolated B. coagulans strains have potential probiotic characteristics and could be used as candidate probiotics in heat-treated vegan probiotic food products.

A simple and green ultrasound liquid-liquid microextraction method based on low viscous hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent for the preconcentration and separation of selenium in water and food samples prior to HG-AAS detection.		Food Chemistry					A simple and green ultrasound liquid-liquid microextraction method based on low viscous hydrophobic deep eutectic solvent (ULLME-LV-HDES) was proposed for the preconcentration and separation of selenium prior to HG-AAS detection. Six different DESs were prepared for the extraction of selenium. Quercetin was used complexing agent for Se (IV) ions. Various analytical parameters such as pH, quercetin amount, DES type and its volume, sonication time, sample volume were optimized. Tolerance limits of anion, cation and transition metal ions were studied. Preconcentration and enhancement factor were found 62.5 and 121. Under the optimum conditions, limit of detection was found 0.25 ng L-1 with calibration range of 0.8-120 ng L-1. Relative standard deviation was found 3.2%. The accuracy of the method was confirmed with certified reference materials (NIST 1567a Wheat flour and NIST 1548a Typical diet). Finally, the developed method was successfully applied to food and water samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A new analytical approach for preconcentration, separation and determination of Pb(II) and Cd(II) in real samples using a new adsorbent: synthesis, characterization and application.		Food Chemistry					A green and efficient analytical approach was reported for simultaneous preconcentration, and separation of Pb (II) and Cd (II) in water, vegetables, and barbecue samples by dispersive solid-phase microextraction prior to their determination using flame atomic absorption spectrometry. A new poly-3-hydroxy butyrate-polyvinyl triethyl ammonium chloride comb-type amphiphilic cationic block copolymer (PHBvbNCl) was synthesized and characterized. Main variables such as pH, sorbent amount, adsorption time, eluent type, desorption time, and sample volume were optimized. Detection limits and working ranges for Pb (II) and Cd (II) were 0.03 mug L-1, 0.15 mug L-1, 0.1-250 mug L-1 and 0.5-375 mug L-1, respectively. Enhancement factor for Pb (II) and Cd (II) were 114 and 98. The adsorption capacity of PHBvbNCl for Pb (II) and Cd (II) was 175.2 mg g-1 and 152.9 mg g-1. After the accuracy of the method was confirmed by the analysis of certified reference materials, it was successfully applied to real samples.

Investigations of Hg(II) analysis in real samples via computational chemistry, experimental design, and green microextraction approach.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					An economical and green nanostructured supramolecular solvent-based ultrasound-assisted homogeneous liquid-liquid microextraction procedure was developed to separate and preconcentrate Hg(II) ions in water and vegetable samples in the presented article. The interactions between chemical species were investigated using computational chemistry. The experimental design was used to optimize critical variables influencing the separation of Hg(II). Under optimum conditions (pH=6.4; the volume of supramolecular, 170 muL; the amount of ligand, 14 mmol L-1; extraction temperature, 35°C), the linearity was in the range of 1-450 mug L-1. The procedure has an enrichment factor of 82 with a detection limit of 0.33 mug L-1. In addition, repeatability and reproducibility precisions for 10,100, and 300 mug L-1 of Hg(II) were in the range of 1.8-3.4% and 2.5-4.4%, respectively. The accuracy was tested by analyzing certified reference materials and then successfully applied for the pre-concentration and determination of Hg(II) ions in the selected samples with relative recovery.

J		Altunay, N.; Elik, A.; Katin, K.							Optimization of vortex-assisted ionic liquid dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction by experimental design prior to hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry for determination of selenium species in food, beverage and water samples.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					We applied novel vortex-assisted ionic liquid dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (VA-IL-DLLME) method to preconcentration and extraction of Se (IV) ions from water, beverage and food samples. The method was optimized using central composite design combined with the response surface analysis. After extraction, inorganic selenium species (total Se, Se (IV) and Se (VI)) were determined by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry. 1 -n-Octyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethane)-sulfonamide [C8mim NTf2] and tetrahydrofuran were used as the extraction and dispersive solvents, respectively. Applied vortex assisted the extractant dispersion and accelerated the mass transfer process. Obtained optimum conditions for microextraction procedure are as follows: mass of [C8mim NTf2], pH, extraction time and THF volume should be equal to 85 mg, 6.8,15 min and 730 muL, respectively. Under these conditions, we observed linear range, limit of detection and enrichment factor equal to 5-500ng L-1, 1.5 ng L-1 and 120, respectively. We also fount linear regression coefficients in the dependence between Absorbance and Se (IV) concentration: Absorbance=0.0652 CSe (IV) + 0.0185. We added 200 mug kg-1 of Se (IV) to selected food samples and 100 ng L-1 of Se (IV) to selected waters and beverages. Relative standard deviations and recovery values were within the ranges of 2.4-3.5% and 92.7/103.4%, respectively. The optimized VA-IL-DLLME method reported here provides high extraction efficiency, fast extraction and lower detection limit without a heating step than alternative microextraction methods. This method also requires environmental solvents for determination and preconcentration of trace Se species in the selected samples. In addition, the reported VA-IL-DLLME procedure is the first method which use [C8mim NTf2] as extraction solvent for the preconcentration and separation of Se (IV) ions.

J		Altunoglu, Y.; Yemiscioglu, F.							Determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in olives exposed to three different industrial sources and in their respective oils.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Atmospheric contamination of plant raw material with Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) helps explain their presence in edible vegetable oils. This study compared PAH contamination of Turkish olive fruits during their growing period on the tree and their respective oils from three different industrial sources (petroleum refinery, thermal power plant and heavy industry site). The method included liquid-liquid extraction solid-phase extraction for cleanup followed by HPLC with fluorescence detector. There were statistically significant differences between the three industrial sources in benzo [a] pyrene content, the sum of light, total PAHs and PAH4 (p< 0.05), but only slight differences in PAH profiles. The highest level of PAH compounds was measured in samples exposed to pollution from the petroleum refinery, nearly twice as high as samples exposed to the thermal power plant which showed the lowest contamination levels. None of the samples analysed exceeded the limits stipulated by current legislation. The transfer ratios of PAH compounds from olives to olive oil were 22.8-73.2%. This indicates that PAHs either diffuse directly from skin to oil within the fruit or transfer during oil extraction. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	3	439	451	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1861340					FSTA:2021-07-Ne1611
J		Alvarado, M.; Penney, T. L.; Unwin, N.; Murphy, M. M.; Adams, J.							Evidence of a health risk "signalling effect" following the introduction of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax.		Food Policy					Consuming sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has been associated with increased rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes, making SSBs an increasingly popular target for taxation. In addition to changing prices, the introduction of an SSB tax may convey information about the health risks of SSBs (a signalling effect). If SSB taxation operates in part by producing a health risk signal, there may be important opportunities to amplify this effect. Our aim was to assess whether there is evidence of a risk signalling effect following the introduction of the Barbados SSB tax. We used process tracing to assess the existence of a signalling effect around sodas and sugar-sweetened juices (juice drinks). We used three data sources: 611 archived transcripts of local television news, 30 interviews with members of the public, and electronic point of sales data (46 months) from a major grocery store chain. We used directed content analysis to assess the qualitative data and an interrupted time series analysis to assess the quantitative data. We found evidence consistent with a risk signalling effect following the introduction of the SSB tax for sodas but not for juice drinks. Consistent with risk signalling theory, the findings suggest that consumers were aware of the tax, believed in a health rationale for the tax, understood that sodas were taxed and perceived that sodas and juice drinks were unhealthy. However consumers appear not to have understood that juice drinks were taxed, potentially reducing tax effectiveness from a health perspective. In addition, the tax may have incentivised companies to increase advertising around juice drinks (undermining any signalling effect) and to introduce low-cost SSB product lines. Policymakers can maximize the impact of risk signals by being clear about the definition of taxed SSBs, emphasizing the health rationale for introducing such a policy, and introducing co-interventions (e.g.marketing restrictions) that reduce opportunities for industry countersignals. These actions may amplify the impact of an SSB tax. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					The objective of the present work was to produce dog foods from a single recipe at three levels of resistant starch (RS). The low (LS), medium (MS), and high shear (HS) foods were produced on a single-screw extruder at target screw speeds of 250, 375 and 460 rpm, respectively, and with increasing in-barrel moisture as shear decreased. Post-production, kibble measurements and starch analyses were conducted. Kibble parameters were compared by ANOVA with significance noted at p< 0.05 with a single degree of freedom orthogonal contrasts for extrusion outputs, starch analyses, and viscosity (RVA). The MS and LS kibbles exiting the extruder were denser and less expanded (p< 0.05) than the HS treatment. Resistant starch, starch cook, and raw:cooked starch RVA AUC increased linearly as shear decreased. These results confirmed that lower mechanical energy processes led to decreased starch gelatinization and greater retention of in vitro RS. © 2021 by the authors.

Applying computational fluid dynamics in the development of smart ripening rooms for traditional cheeses.		Foods					Traditional ewe's cheese producers face certain challenges caused by fluctuating environmental parameters inside the ripening room, which lead to lack of homogeneity in the final product. The present research discusses the application of computer fluid dynamics for simulating the distribution of environmental parameters, predicting the airflow pattern, and identifying critical areas where such parameters could cause reduced cheese quality. A new monitoring system was developed including presence sensors, temperature and humidity dataloggers, pneumatic actuators, microcontrollers, and microcomputers connected remotely for control, data visualization, and processing. The validation of the computer simulation and monitoring system was made with a batch of 40 ewe's cheeses distributed in three different zones inside a prototype ripening room and ripened for 35 days. At 35 days, a physical, chemical, and microbiological characterization of cheeses was made for evaluation of the influence of environmental conditions on cheese quality. The comparison between simulated and local measurements showed close agreement, especially concerning air velocity inside the stacks of cheese. The results of Pearson's correlation analysis and PCA concluded that temperature affected the appearance of the rind, hardness, number and area occupied by holes. Humidity affected aw and mFeret. Air velocity affected pH and the circularity of gas holes. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Meat Science					The aim of the current study was to identify whether changes in pH or temperature during the development of rigor mortis influence spectral quality and thus the prediction of intramuscular fat (IMF) in hot lamb carcases. Semimembranosus muscles (SM) of 75 lamb carcases were measured pre-rigor 3 times (Runs 1-3) using a near infrared (NIR) spectrometer with muscle pH and temperature also recorded. Calibration models for the prediction of IMF showed that spectra measurements taken at Run 2 (R2 = 0.42, RMSE = 0.75) and Run 3 (R2 = 0.38, RMSE = 0.78) provided more accurate and precise models compared to Run 1 (R2 = 0.27, RMSE = 0.84). An association between spectral variance, internal and surface temperature of the SM was observed across runs. These results suggest that, as muscle temperature declined during the early post-mortem period there was an improved ability of NIR spectra to predict IMF. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Meat Science					Meat from cull cows is traditionally sold in Australia for mincemeat, but this study examined whether there is potential to add value by identifying meat of higher quality from older cattle. Dentition and ossification score were recorded for 173 Angus cattle of known age, ranging from 26 months to 12.6 years. Longissimus and semitendinosus muscles were sampled to assess the effect of chronological age on shear force and connective tissue. Age explained variation in shear force of the semitendinosus better than in the longissimus muscle, but had little effect on shear force values per se. At 2 days postmortem, 18% of the longissimus muscles were classified as tender reaching 65% as ageing extended to 14 days. Soluble collagen was a better predictor of age than total collagen. This study shows that the current practice of routinely selling meat from culled cows as mincemeat overlooks a valuable opportunity to grade and sell a significant proportion at higher price as prime cuts.

Using extended Bigelow meta-regressions for modelling the effects of temperature, pH, °Brix on the inactivation of heat resistant moulds.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The management of Heat Resistant Moulds (HRMs) is considered a great challenge for the juice fruit industry. Neosartorya, Byssochlamys and Talaromyces are three out of the main genera isolated from fruit juices that show great resistance to heat treatments. Several inactivation parameters can be found in the literature, however all of them were carried out in specific food matrices and using diverse inactivation methods. Thus, this meta-analysis study synthesizes the thermal resistance parameters of the three HRMs by adjusting extended Bigelow-based meta-regression models to data on inactivation experiments conducted in different liquid media. The meta-analytical data, extracted from publications between 1969 and 2017, was composed of decimal reduction time (D), inactivation method, temperature of inactivation, pH, °Brix, age of spores, and type of medium (model, juice, concentrates). Pooled D* values (D at 90 °C, pH 3.5 and 12° Brix) were estimated for B. fulva (1.95 min; 95% CI: 1.21-3.11 min), Talaromyces (4.03 min; 95% CI: 3.43-4.74 min), Neosartorya (0.5.35 min; 95% CI: 4.10-7.08 min), and B. nivea (10.32 min; 95% CI: 5.81-18.4 min). It was found that increasing the soluble solids in concentrates tends to cause a lower decrease in the heat resistance of Neosartorya and Talaromyces than increasing the soluble solids in model liquid or juices (p=0.001; 0.012). In general, the screw-capped tubes and three neck round inactivation methods render higher D* values (p< 0.05) than the thermal death tubes, the polyethylene bag and the capillary methods. Spores of Talaromyces (overall zpH =7.56; 95% CI: 5.13-13.5) and Neosartorya (overall zpH =7.07; 95% CI: 5.04-10.8) appear to be more thermal sensitive to a decrease in medium pH than spores of Byssochlamys (overall zpH =4.34; 95% CI: 3.20-6.73).

J		Alvarez, A.; Manjarres, J. J.; Ramirez, C.; Bolivar, G.							Use of an exopolysaccharide-based edible coating and lactic acid bacteria with antifungal activity to preserve the postharvest quality of cherry tomato.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					One of the main causes of cherry tomato postharvest loss is diseases caused by food-contaminating fungi. Edible coatings (ECs) can preserve the quality of this crop and can serve as carriers of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which have demonstrated inhibitory potential against phytopathogenic fungi. In the present study, the effectiveness of the LAB strain Lactiplantibacillus plantarum A6 incorporated into an EC based on exopolysaccharide from Weissella confusa JCA4 on the physicochemical and microbiological quality of cherry tomato was evaluated. The fruit were artificially inoculated with the fungi Aspergillus niger, Fusarium sp., and Rhizopus stolonifer to test the antifungal potential of the coating. The physicochemical and microbiological quality of cherry tomato was studied at two storage temperatures to calculate its shelf life. L. plantarum A6 remained viable both in the solution and on the surface of the fruit after coating, protecting the fruit against two of the three evaluated fungi (Fusarium sp. and Rhizopus stolonifer). The EC controlled weight loss, maintained firmness, and slowed the respiration rate of cherry tomato; the other physicochemical properties and the appearance of the fruit were not negatively affected. Based on these results, prolongation of shelf life was achieved by the application of the exopolysaccharide coating. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Updated peer review of the pesticide risk assessment of the active substance asulam (variant evaluated asulam-sodium).		EFSA Journal					The conclusions of EFSA following the peer review of the initial risk assessments carried out by the competent authority of the rapporteur Member State, the United Kingdom (France after Brexit), for the pesticide active substance asulam and the assessment of applications for maximum residue levels (MRLs) are reported. The context of the peer review was that required by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council. The conclusions were reached on the basis of the evaluation of the representative use of asulam (variant evaluated asulam-sodium) as a herbicide on spinach and tulip, hyacinth and lily for bulb production. MRLs were assessed in spinach. The conclusions were updated with regard to the endocrine-disrupting properties following a mandate received from the European Commission in February 2019. In addition, the peer review also provided considerations on whether exposure to humans and the environment from the representative uses of asulam-sodium can be considered negligible, taking into account the European Commission's draft guidance on this topic. The reliable endpoints, appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment and the proposed MRLs, are presented. Missing information identified as being required by the regulatory framework is listed. Concerns are identified. An evaluation of data concerning the necessity of asulam-sodium as a herbicide to control a serious danger to plant health which cannot be contained by other available means, including non-chemical methods is also presented. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

J		Alvarez, F.; Messean, A.; Streissl, F.			European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Assessment of the 2019 post-market environmental monitoring report on the cultivation of genetically modified maize MON 810 in the EU.		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA assessed the 2019 post-market environmental monitoring (PMEM) report on the cultivation of Cry1Ab-expressing maize event MON810. Like previous years, there was full compliance with refuge requirement in Portugal and partial compliance with refuge requirements by Spanish farmers growing MON810 varieties. European and Mediterranean corn borer populations collected from north-eastern Spain during the 2019 maize growing season and tested for Cry1Ab susceptibility show no symptoms of resistance to maize MON810. The assessment of farmer questionnaires and relevant scientific publications does not indicate any unanticipated adverse effects on human and animal health or the environment arising from the cultivation of maize MON810. Overall, EFSA concludes that the evidence reported in the 2019 PMEM report does not invalidate previous EFSA evaluations on the safety of maize MON810. However, as in previous years, EFSA identifies shortcomings on resistance monitoring that need revision in future reports. In particular, the monitoring plan, as implemented in 2019, is not sufficiently sensitive to detect the recommended 3% resistance allele frequency. Consequently, EFSA strongly recommends the consent holder toachieve full compliance with refuge obligations in areas where adoption of maize MON810 is high andincrease the sensitivity of the monitoring plan by performing periodic F2 screens on corn borer populations from north-eastern Spain. EFSA recommends revising the farmer questionnaires when new characteristics of the receiving environment emerge which are relevant for the environmental risk assessment of MON 810 such as the emergence of teosinte. EFSA encourages the Competent authorities of concerned EU Member States, the consent holder and environmental networks to engage in a dialogue to develop a framework on how to best identify and report unexpected adverse effects from the cultivation of Bt maize varieties. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

J		Alvarez, L.; Urrutia, P.; Olivares, A.; Flores, A.; Bhandari, B.; Almonacid, S.							Comparison of microwave short time and oven heating pretreatment on crystallization of raisins.		Foods					Crystalline material can develop on the surface of raisins during storage and transport, affecting the final acceptability of the product. In this work, a mild thermal pretreatment was applied to raisins to melt the pre-existing crystals and the effect of such thermal treatments on the development of crystals over a storage period was investigated. The raisins selected for this study were of the Thompson seedless variety from one Chilean company. The thermal pretreatment of raisins at 50 °C and 70 °C for 20 min in an oven and microwave (800 W) irradiation for 15 s resulted in a reduction in the percentage of crystallized raisins (w/w) from more than 50% in the control samples to less than 10% after 35 days of storage at 15 and 25 °C in a 57% relative humidity environment. The results showed that some textural parameters, such as cohesiveness and chewiness, were not affected by thermal treatment and were independent of storage temperature. © 2020 by the authors.

J		Alvarez, M.; Delgado, J.; Nunez, F.; Cebrian, E.; Andrade, M. J.							Proteomic analyses reveal mechanisms of action of biocontrol agents on ochratoxin A repression in Penicillium nordicum.		Food Control					Penicillium nordicum is among the main ochratoxin A (OTA) producers in dry-cured fermented sausages. Recent strategies to prevent its development on the surface of these products include the substitution of synthetic antifungals, such as potassium sorbate, by natural compounds. However, the mechanisms of action of the latter are still unclear. The Proteomic analysis is a useful tool to elucidate the basis of the antifungal compound effects on moulds. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of biocontrol agents on the OTA repression in P. nordicum and its relation to proteome changes. Seven different combinations of rosemary leaves, rosemary essential oil, acorn shell extract and the yeast Debaryomyces hansenii have been tested as biocontrol agents against two ochratoxigenic P. nordicum strains on a dry-cured fermented sausage-based medium. The rosemary essential oil and the combination of rosemary leaves with D. hansenii provoked significant inhibition of OTA production in both moulds (p≤0.05). The acorn shell extract and D. hansenii individually decreased OTA only in one of the mould strains. The Proteomic analyses revealed that rosemary essential oil reduced the abundance of proteins involved in the polyketide synthase enoylreductase domain in both moulds, which would explain the OTA reduction. However, the combination of rosemary leaves with D. hansenii showed inter-strain differences, reducing the abundance of proteins related to the cell wall integrity and to the purine pathway, depending on the tested mould. In conclusion, rosemary essential oil and the combination of rosemary leaves with D. hansenii can be proposed as efficient biocontrol agents against ochratoxigenic P. nordicum on dry-cured fermented sausages, although some inter-strain differences at proteome level were found regarding the mechanism of action involved in the reported OTA repression.

J		Alvarez, M.; Rodriguez, A.; Bermudez, E.; Roncero, E.; Andrade, M. J.							Development of a methodology for estimating the ergosterol in meat product-borne toxigenic moulds to evaluate antifungal agents.		Foods					Antifungal agents are commonly used in the meat industry to prevent the growth of unwanted moulds, such as toxigenic ones, on dry-cured meat products. For enhancing the application of antifungals, their mode of action must be evaluated. Their effect on the mould ergosterol content is one of the most studied ones, since it is the target site of some commercialised antifungals or of those that are in development. The aim of this study was to develop a methodology for determining how the antifungal agents used in the meat industry work. A method for analysing ergosterol was firstly developed using high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection coupled to a diode array detector (HPLC-FLD/DAD). The chromatographically optimised conditions (gradient and mobile phases) allowed us to reduce the time per analysis with respect to previously published methods up to 22 min. Withing the six checked extraction methods, method 5, showing the best mean recovery values (99.51%), the shortest retention time (15.8 min), and the lowest standard deviation values (9.92) and working temperature (60 °C), was selected. The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.03 and 0.1 g/mL, respectively. All the validation parameters corroborated the method's suitability. Finally, its feasibility for evaluating the effect of a commercial antifungal preparation (AP) and different herbs that are frequently added to meat products on the ergosterol content of several toxigenic moulds was studied. Differences at the strain level were obtained in the presence of AP. Moreover, the addition of herbs significantly reduced the ergosterol content in Penicillium nordicum up to 83.91%. The developed methodology is thus suitable for screening the antifungals' role in altering mould ergosterol biosynthesis before their application in real meat products. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alvarez, M. D.; Cofrades, S.; Espert, M.; Salvador, A.; Sanz, T.							Thermorheological characterization of healthier reduced-fat cocoa butter formulated by substitution with a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)-based oleogel.		Foods					Cocoa butter (CB) is a main ingredient in pastry due to the unique functional properties of its fat, which is high in saturated fatty acids (SFAs). However, excessive consumption of SFAs is associated with the occurrence of several chronic diseases. This study researched the partial or total replacement of CB by an oleogel (OG) formulated with a healthier lipid profile, for mixed systems that would allow a partial substitution of CB in confectionery products. The "emulsion-templated approach" was used to develop a sunflower oil-HPMC-based OG. Different CB: OG ratios were formulated increasing the percentage replacement of CB by OG from 50 to 100%. Rheological and textural properties were determined and compared with a CB control at 20 and 10 °C. Oil-binding capacity was also analyzed. The systems showed a solid-like behavior, with higher elastic than viscous modulus, which increased with CB concentration. Compared with 20 °C, at 10 °C there was an increase in connectivity, viscoelasticity, and consistency of the systems, in response to a more complete CB crystallization. The replaced systems also presented a better lipid profile than CB. This evidence suggests that formulated CB: OG system at 50:50 ratio could become useful as a CB equivalent in chocolate products. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Prebiotic-alginate edible coating on fresh-cut apple as a new carrier for probiotic lactobacilli and bifidobacteria.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The increased popularity of vegetarianism, lactose intolerance, and the high cholesterol content of dairy products are all factors that have recently increased the demand for non-dairy probiotic foods. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation of fresh-cut apple coated with alginate-prebiotic on its nutritional, safety, and sensory characteristics. Also, probiotic viability during refrigerated storage and after simulated gastrointestinal digestion (GID) was evaluated. A new non-dairy probiotic food was developed by adding prebiotics (oligofructose and inulin) and probiotic cultures (Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis) to fresh-cut apple. Both probiotics successfully remained above 9.0 log CFU/g in the product after 8 days of storage. Also, high viability retention was achieved after GID with 7.8 and 8.0 log for L. rhamnosus and B. lactis, respectively, without significant effect of prebiotic addition. Microbiological and nutritional quality were maintained, however only those samples with prebiotics and B. lactis remained sensorially acceptable after 8 d. Furthermore, both probiotics exerted bactericidal effect against L. innocua inoculated on apple cubes with reductions higher than 1.8 log meanwhile, the effect on E. coli O157:H7 was less pronounced. Thereby, apple pieces coated with prebiotic-alginate solution constitute a promising alternative to design new carriers for probiotic bacteria.

Combined action of Shiga toxin type 2 and subtilase cytotoxin in the pathogenesis of hemolytic uremic syndrome.		Toxins					Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) produces Stx1 and/or Stx2, and Subtilase cytotoxin (SubAB). Since these toxins may be present simultaneously during STEC infections, the purpose of this work was to study the co-action of Stx2 and SubAB. Stx2 + SubAB was assayed in vitro on monocultures and cocultures of human glomerular endothelial cells (HGEC) with a human proximal tubular epithelial cell line (HK-2) and in vivo in mice after weaning. The effects in vitro of both toxins, co-incubated and individually, were similar, showing that Stx2 and SubAB contribute similarly to renal cell damage. However, in vivo, co-injection of toxins lethal doses reduced the survival time of mice by 24 h and mice also suffered a strong decrease in the body weight associated with a lowered food intake. Co-injected mice also exhibited more severe histological renal alterations and a worsening in renal function that was not as evident in mice treated with each toxin separately. Furthermore, co-treatment induced numerous erythrocyte morphological alterations and an increase of free hemoglobin. This work shows, for the first time, the in vivo effects of Stx2 and SubAB acting together and provides valuable information about their contribution to the damage caused in STEC infections. © 2021 by the authors.

Functional fermented beverage made with apple, tibicos, and pectic polysaccharides from prickly pear (Opuntia ficus-indica L. Mill) peels.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The extraction of pectic polysaccharides from Opuntia ficus-indica peels was performed by two methods: acid hydrolysis (0.1N HCl; 70% ethanol, pH = 1.5), by the use of different ratios of sample/solvent (1:5, 1:7 wt/vol) at 90 0.1°C for 40 min and ultrasound-assisted extraction with amplitude of 30%, nominal power of 125 W, at three times (10, 20, 30 min), and 45 0.1°C. The yield, degree of methoxylation, and galacturonic acid were evaluated. The pectic polysaccharides obtained from the peels of Opuntia showed weak gel behavior. The symbiotic product was elaborated with apple juice, tibicos as a starter culture, pectic polysaccharides at two concentrations (7.5 and 10% wt/vol), and cane sugar (60% wt/vol). The storage stability at relative humidity 75% and temperature (7, 25, and 40°C) along 42 days was evaluated. The product was microbiologically and mechanically stable for 42 days at 7°C. Novelty impact statement. The use of ultrasound improves the polygalacturonic acid extraction from pectic polysaccharides of prickly pear peels; this material could be used to obtain a fermented product by tibicos and apple with good mechanical and microbiological stability until 42 days at 7°C. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Spray-drying microencapsulation of pomegranate juice increases its antioxidant activity after in vitro digestion.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Most of the work on pomegranate antioxidant and antibacterial activity has been carried out with solvent extracts of different plant or fruit parts. Biosensitive compounds in juice may be subject to oxidation, reducing their biological activities. Microencapsulation can be used to protect compounds, allowing its incorporation into functional foods. This study aimed at investigating antioxidant activity after in vitro digestion of microencapsulated juice. Pomegranate juice was encapsulated by spray drying its maltodextrin and gum arabic. The average diameter of the microcapsules was 10-50 m. We evaluated the bioaccessibility of microencapsulated phenolic compounds by using an in vitro enzymatic digestion. The total phenolic content in digested microencapsulated juice was three times greater than in undigested, indicating that the compounds were made bioaccessible. Digestion also increased antioxidant activity, as measured by ABTS+ or by DPPH. Additionally, microencapsulated pomegranate juice showed antibacterial activity against the nine bacteria species tested. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Has COVID-19 changed the lifestyle and dietary habits in the Spanish population after confinement?		Foods					Since 2020, the world has been immersed in a change in lifestyle (social, lifestyle, nutrition and physical activity patterns), due to the appearance of COVID-19 and the strict mobility measures which were implemented to prevent its spread. All these changes had a nutritional impact on people, modifying their dietary guidelines. This cross-sectional study was carried out to assess whether dietary habits, lifestyle, and adherence to the Mediterranean diet among the Spanish adult population (25-65 years old) during confinement was modified during the post-confinement period, using an e-survey through social networks, involving 510 subjects. A decrease in the intake of ultra-processed products, with a correlation between weekly food delivery orders at home and the consumption of salty snacks, sugary drinks, and processed pastries was also recorded. Most of the subjects performed physical exercise on a regular basis, maintaining the body weight in half of the participants. During the post-confinement period a substantial proportion of the population had healthy lifestyle and dietary habits, including the adequate consumption of fruits, vegetables and legumes; adequate time was spent preparing meals and the population did not regularly order food at home, which in the long term, reduced the risk of several diseases. © 2021 by the authors.

Unraveling the emergence and population diversity of Listeria monocytogenes in a newly built meat facility through whole genome sequencing.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The food processing environments of a newly opened meat processing facility were sampled in ten visits carried out during its first 1.5 years of activity and analyzed for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. A total of 18 L. monocytogenes isolates were obtained from 229 samples, and their genomes were sequenced to perform comparative genomic analyses. An increase in the frequency of isolation of L. monocytogenes and in the diversity of sequence types (STs) detected was observed along time. Although the strains isolated belonged to six different STs (ST8, ST9, ST14, ST37, ST121 and ST155), ST9 was the most abundant (8 out of 18 strains). Low (0 and 2) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) distances were found between two pairs of ST9 strains isolated in both cases 3 months apart from the same processing room (Lm-1267 and Lm-1705, with a 2 SNPs distance in the core genome; Lm-1265 and Lm-1706, with a 0 SNPs distance), which suggests that these strains may be persistent L. monocytogenes strains in the food processing environment. Most strains showed an in silico attenuated virulence potential either through the truncation of InlA (in 67% of the isolates) or the absence of other virulence factors involved in cell adhesion or invasion. Twelve of the eighteen L. monocytogenes isolates contained a plasmid, which ranged in size from 4 to 87 Kb and harbored stress survival, in addition to heavy metals and biocides resistance determinants. Identical or highly similar plasmids were identified for various sets of L. monocytogenes ST9 isolates, which suggests the clonal expansion and persistence of plasmid-containing ST9 strains in the processing environments of the meat facility. Finally, the analysis of the L. monocytogenes genomes available in the NCBI database, and their associated metadata, evidenced that strains from ST9 are more frequently reported in Europe, linked to foods, particularly to meat and pork products, and less represented among clinical isolates than other L. monocytogenes STs. It also showed that the ST9 strains here isolated were more closely related to the European isolates, which clustered together and separated from ST9 North American isolates.

Coconut oil supplementation during development reduces brain excitability in adult rats nourished and overnourished in lactation.		Food & Function					Introduction. Coconut oil has been considered as a therapeutic alternative in several pathologies, but there is limited information regarding its effects on brain functioning. Objective. This study analyzed whether early virgin coconut oil (VCO) supplementation interferes with electrical activity of the adult rat brain and its lipid peroxidation. Moreover, it investigated whether the putative effect on brain electrophysiology could be affected by overnutrition occurring during lactation, and/or by environmental enrichment (EE). Electrophysiology was measured through cortical spreading depression (CSD), a phenomenon related to brain excitability. Methods: Wistar rats were suckled in litters of either nine or three pups, forming nourished (N) or overnourished (ON) groups, respectively. Between the 7th and 30th days of life, half of the animals in each group received VCO (10 mg kg-1 d-1; by gavage). The other half received an equivalent amount of vehicle (V, 0.009% cremophor). On day 36, animals from both groups were subjected to EE for 4 weeks. At 105 15 days of life, each animal was subjected to CSD recordings and lipid peroxidation analyses. Results. Overnutrition during lactation enhanced body and brain weights. VCO decelerated the CSD propagation velocity (control-3.57 0.23 mm min-1 versus VCO-3.27 0.18 mm min-1; p < 0.001), regardless of whether subjected to overnourishment or EE exposure. Neither VCO nor EE modified the cerebral lipid peroxidation (p > 0.05). Conclusion. VCO supplementation impaired the spreading of CSD, indicating reduction of brain excitability. VCO effects occurred regardless of the nutritional state during lactation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	7	3096	3103	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00086a					FSTA:2021-08-Ne1868

Characterization of kefir produced in household conditions: physicochemical and nutritional profile, and storage stability.		Foods					Kefir, a traditional fermented food, has numerous health benefits due to its unique chemical composition, which is reflected in its excellent nutritional value. Physicochemical and microbial composition of kefir obtained from fermented milk are influenced by the type of the milk, grain to milk ratio, time and temperature of fermentation, and storage conditions. It is crucial that kefir characteristics are maintained during storage since continuous metabolic activities of residual kefir microbiota may occur. This study aimed to examine the nutritional profile of kefir produced in traditional in use conditions by fermentation of ultra-high temperature pasteurized (UHT) semi-skimmed cow milk using argentinean kefir grains and compare the stability and nutritional compliance of freshly made and refrigerated kefir. Results indicate that kefir produced under home use conditions maintains the expected characteristics with respect to the physicochemical parameters and composition, both after fermentation and after refrigerated storage. This work further contributes to the characterization of this food product that is so widely consumed around the world by focusing on kefir that was produced in a typical household setting. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Alves, E.; Gregorio, J.; Baby, A. R.; Rijo, P.; Rodrigues, L. M.; Rosado, C.							Homemade kefir consumption improves skin condition-a study conducted in healthy and atopic volunteers.		Foods					Diet has a fundamental role in the homeostasis of bodily functions, including the skin, which, as an essential protective barrier, plays a crucial role in this balance. The skin and intestine appear to share a series of indirect metabolic pathways, in a dual relationship known as the "gut-skin axis". Hence, the gut-skin axis might be receptive to modulation via dietary modification, where probiotics can be included, thus representing a potential therapeutic target in inflammatory skin diseases, such as atopic dermatitis (AD), in order to control and/or ameliorate symptoms. Kefir is one of the most ancient fermented foods, with probiotic characteristics that have been associated with a wide variety of health-promoting benefits, and it presents a microbiological diversity that makes its application as a probiotic in the gut-skin relationship of the utmost interest. However, the impact of a diet containing kefir on skin health has yet to be reported in scientific literature. This study aimed to assess the impact of the intake of homemade kefir in the skin of healthy and atopic volunteers. The intervention resulted in a boost on barrier function in both skin types verified only in the respective kefir intake groups. An improvement in the degree of severity of AD was also confirmed for the kefir intake group. Atopic individuals may benefit from kefir intake, especially in regard to their skin hydration. Finally, the effects observed on skin barrier function in this study probably culminate from the effects of all the ingredients in kefir, including the complex microbiota, its metabolites and macro-and micronutrients resulting from the fermentation. This work opens the way for more advanced research on the impact of the probiotic kefir on cutaneous health, further clarifying its mechanism of action namely via gut-skin axis. © 2021 by the authors.

An alkaline dissolution-based method using tetramethylammonium hydroxide for metals determination in cow milk samples.		Food Chemistry					This study approaches the development of a method for the determination of Ca, Mg, Zn, and Fe in liquid and powdered cow milk. The method is based on sample dissolution assisted by ultrasound energy in tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) media and determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS). Central composite design (CCD) associated with response surface methodology and desirability function allowed the fast and efficient optimization of the variables involved in the performance of the dissolution. The developed dissolution method allowed Ca, Fe, Zn, and Mg determination in milk samples with adequate analytical characteristics for these determinations. Addition/recovery tests and analysis of a certified reference material of skimmed powdered milk (ERM-BD150) have shown that this method presents enough accuracy to carry out these analyses.

Multivariate optimization of a goat meat alkaline solubilization procedure using tetramethylammonium hydroxide for metals determination using FAAS.		Food Chemistry					In the present work, multivariate designs were used to optimize an alkaline dissolution, assisted by ultrasound energy, procedure of goat meat using tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) aiming to determine Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Na and Zn by flame atomic absorption (FAAS) and emission (FAES) spectrometry. The optimal conditions found for the dissolution were in the following ranges: 0.4-0.5 g for the sample mass, 12-15 min of sonication and using 700-1000 L of 25% TMAH at a temperature of 50 °C. The obtained limits of quantification varied between 0.221 (Mg) and 7.60 (Ca) mug g-1. Accuracy was assessed by comparing the results obtained by applying the proposed method with the digestion in an acid medium using a digesting block and by analyzing bovine liver certified reference material. The application of a t-test revealed that, at a 95% confidence level, there were no significant differences between the values obtained.

Six months under uncontrolled relative humidity and room temperature changes technological characteristics and maintains the physicochemical and functional properties of carioca beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.).		Food Chemistry					Carioca beans contribute to health maintenance around the world, and the evaluation of commercial postharvest storage (CPS) ensures their quality. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of CPS on technological, physicochemical and functional properties of carioca beans. Two genotypes (Pontal-PO and Madreperola-MP beans) were stored under CPS or controlled conditions and were evaluated after harvest and after three-and six-months storage. PO and MP hardened with time, but the cooking time did not differ. PO is darker than MP and both darkened over time. Storage time affected pH and acidity of the beans and MP presented better physicochemical properties than PO, with lower activity of peroxidase (p=0.004) and polyphenoloxidase (p=0.001) enzymes. Glycosylated kaempferol was suggested as a possible chemical marker to differentiate the aging of PO and MP beans. In conclusion, besides the technological differences, the storage was able to prevent physicochemical and functional alterations of beans.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The development of smart biodegradable films emerges as an alternative capable of indicating the correlation between the pH of a product and the color changes related to the degradation processes. Therefore, the aim of this investigation was to develop smart biodegradable films using biopolymers, green banana starch, gelatin, alginate, and red cabbage extract as a quality indicator in sheep meat. The polymeric indicator films were prepared from three formulations: (I) 2% starch + 0.5 grams of glycerol + 5% of red cabbage extract; (II) 2% starch + 2% gelatin + 0.7 grams of glycerol + 5% red cabbage extract; (III) 1.5% alginate + 0.5% starch + 2% gelatin + 1% glycerol + 15% red cabbage extract and evaluated for light sensitivity, swelling index, water vapor transmission, and pH activation. The films showed changes in hydrophilicity according to their formulation. In addition, the alginate/starch/gelatin formulation added with 15% of red cabbage extract showed the highest swelling rate (91.30%), activation of water vapor transmission (5.3 g mm m2/h/Pa), and pH, in addition to activation in sheep meat the formulation with the best potential as a pH indicator package. Thus, smart biodegradable films with red cabbage extract have high biodegradability and allow consumers to choose a product with higher preservation quality. Practical applications. The deterioration of food is directly related to changes in the pH of the product, therefore, the use of smart biodegradable films incorporated with plant extracts, such as red cabbage, appears as an excellent alternative for the consumer to detect changes in the product. In this investigation, the use of natural polymers, starch, and alginate performed well in the production of films with plant extract. Therefore, the application of biodegradable polymers and red cabbage extract in the development of intelligent films, emerges as a new approach of satisfactory potential for insertion in the market, being a viable alternative for application in the food industry, with regard to the quality and conservation of food matrices. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.14997					FSTA:2021-05-Sl2978

Development of fermented beverage with water kefir in water-soluble coconut extract (Cocos nucifera L.) with inulin addition.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The use of water-soluble plant-based extracts is a viable option of a non-dairy substrate in developing new food products, such as for kefir fermented beverage. The aim of this study was to develop a vegan fermented beverage with water kefir in the water-soluble coconut extract (WSCE), with inulin. A factorial design 23 was applied, with independent variables: coconut sugar (2.0; 6.0 and 10.0% w/v); inulin (2.0, 2.5 and 3.0% w/v) and xanthan gum (0.0; 0.13 and 0.26% w/v) and dependent variables: growth of kefir grains, fermented beverage yield and lactic acid. The growth of kefir grains was higher when the concentrations of inulin were close to 2.8 and 3.0% (w/v) and xanthan gum up to 0.26% (w/v), influencing in 90% the rate growth. Fermented beverage yield and lactic acid were between 80 to 82.5% and 1.2-1.25%, respectively, when of xanthan gum and coconut sugar were between 0.26 and 10.0% (w/v). Still, fermentative process was significant in terms of nutritional and enzymatic contents. The water kefir showed great potential for adaptation to WSCE in 24 h of fermentation, favoring the development of a non-dairy fermented beverage that may prove to be an alternative for lactose intolerant, allergic and vegans.

From by- to bioproducts: selection of a nanofiltration membrane for biotechnological xylitol purification and process optimization.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Xylitol, an alcohol sugar with diverse applications, is commonly synthesized by chemical routes on an industrial scale. This polyalcohol can also be obtained by fermentation of lignocellulosic biomass. However, downstream purification is still a bottleneck that increases the costs and limits the yield of bioxylitol production. This study aimed to develop a novel approach for purification of xylitol obtained by fermentation of sugarcane bagasse hemicellulose hydrolysate. After nanofiltration membrane selection, process conditions were optimized by surface response methodology. Four nanofiltration membranes were tested: NF (polypiperazine amide), NF90 (fully aromatic polyamide), and NP010 and NP030 (polyethersulfones). NF had the lowest fouling tendency and provided the highest xylitol-protein separation factor and feed-permeate color difference. Factorial design studies revealed that permeate flux and color parameter a* were significantly influenced by pH and pressure. Xylitol productivity and lightness difference were affected by temperature. The best nanofiltration conditions were 40 bar, 40 °C, and pH 5.4. Fermented hydrolysate was subjected to microfiltration and ultrafiltration prior to nanofiltration to minimize fouling. Results. Were satisfactory, with a xylitol purification factor of 3.3, protein separation factor of 8.4, and color removal of 96.0%. Nanofiltration can be used as a preceding step to crystallization in the purification of xylitol obtained from sugarcane bagasse hydrolysate.

J		Alviso, D.; Zarate, C.; Artana, G.; Duriez, T.							Regressions of the dielectric constant and speed of sound of vegetable oils from their composition and temperature using genetic programming.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The dielectric constant (DC) and speed of sound (SoS) have been measured in many studies on vegetable oils (VOs). These measurements can be applied for quality control, for the detection of contaminants, and in works related to heated and frying VOs. There are several hundreds of VOs with potential use in the food industry, and for most of them, the DC and SoS values are not yet available. This paper proposes regression models of the DC and SoS of VOs as a function of their composition (saturated and unsaturated fatty acids) and the temperature. A regression study was conducted using available experimental databases including a total of 57 and 56 data in the range of 20-50 °C for the DC and SoS, respectively. The equations are obtained using genetic programming (GP). The goal is to minimize the mean absolute error (MAE) between the values of the measured and predicted DC and SoS for several VOs. The resulting GP regression equations reproduce correctly the dependencies of the DC and SoS of VOs on the saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The validation of these equations is carried out by comparing their results to those of the experimental databases. The MAE values of the regression equations concerning the databases for DC and SoS of VOs are 0.02 and 1.0 m/s, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Alwis, H. G. de; Nochetto, C.; Kijak, P. J.							An LC-MS/MS method for the determination of antibiotic residues in distillers grains: collaborative study.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Antibiotics are used in ethanol production to discourage the growth of bacteria that would lower the yield of the product. Any antibiotic residues remaining in distillers grain (DG) co-product could lead to antimicrobial resistance, which is a public health concern. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) previously developed an LC-MS/MS analytical method to detect residues of erythromycin A, penicillin G, virginiamycin M1, and virginiamycin S1 in DG to enable regulatory decision making. Objective. The objective of this study was to ensure the method's robustness by carrying out a multi-laboratory validation of the method. Method. Test portions were extracted with a mixture of acetonitrile and buffer. The extract was cleaned by solid phase extraction. The concentrated eluant was reconstituted and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Eight laboratories participated in the study. Results. Average accuracies for the combined three matrixes for all four compounds at all fortification levels ranged from 83->109% with repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr; within laboratory) ≤ 17% and reproducibility relative standard deviation (RSDR; between laboratory) ≤21%. The Horwitz ration (HorRat) values ranged 0.4-1.0 indicating that method reproducibility is acceptable. Conclusions. An interlaboratory study was successfully conducted to evaluate an LC-MS/MS method for the determination of the drugs of interest in DG. The results demonstrate that the method is fit for purpose to determine the drugs in DG and could serve as a regulatory method capable of being used for compliance actions for DG containing these antibiotic contaminants. Highlights. The method was posted to the FDA/Foods Program Compendium of Analytical Laboratory Methods.

J		Aly, A. A.; Maraei, R. W.; Abd-Allah, M. M.; Safwat, G.							Evaluation of physical, biochemical properties and cell viability of gamma irradiated honey.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Honey, rich with polyphenols, vitamins, proteins, organic acids and minerals, and is supersaturated solution of sugars. Gamma irradiation could be a physical food preservation technique which protects against food related-insects and microbial contamination and increases the shelf life of some products. The present research was investigated the effect of gamma-irradiation (0.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 kGy) on the physicochemical possessions of the substances of honey; phenolic and flavonoids content in addition to the antioxidant activity by DPPH radical. Diastase No. Is also identified with and without gamma irradiation. After gamma-irradiation a minor decrease in moisture content was observed while color intensity was significantly increased by elevating irradiation dosage height mainly dose intensity 10.0 kGy which gave the premier color intensity compared with control. But there was no significant difference in the pH values and total soluble solids (TSS%) as well as sugars% of honey samples. Significant increases within the phenolic content were observed with the use of gamma-rays particularly at dose 10.0 kGy which gave the main content relative to the control, while a trivial increase in the flavonoid content was obtained within the rise of the gamma-irradiation dose. The findings have also shown that free radicals can be scavenged by honey and reveal high activity of antioxidants. Hydroxymethylfurfural is reduced by raising the irradiation dose, in converse diastase No. Is enlarged by amplifying the level of the gamma-rays. Also, the results showed that the inhibition zones varied according to the irradiation dose level, the dose level 10.0 kGy was more effective for inhibiting the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as fungal development. The lung cancer cells (A549) showed a decrease in cell viability and density, irradiated honey with dose level 10.0 kGy gave the lowest IC50 (6.08 mg/ml). Honey treated with a dose of 10.0 kg of gamma rays did not affect the physical and biochemical properties of honey and was more effective as an antimicrobial and anti-lung cancer, and the quality of honey remained unchanged upon radiation treatment. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Alyamac, A.; Ozel-Tasci, C.; Gulec, S.							The effect of ankaferd blood stopper on colonic inflammation: an in vitro study in RAW 264.7 and Caco-2 cells.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Ankaferd Blood Stopper (ABS) is a medicinal plant extract that has anti-inflammatory effect. Inflammatory bowel disease is a pathological condition that directly affects colon health and increases the risk of colon cancer. Especially inflammation is an important factor in the formation and progression of this disease. The aim of the study was to investigate the protective effect of ABS on colonic inflammation. Caco-2 and RAW 264.7 cells were used as a model of in vitro colonic inflammation. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide for 12 h to induce inflammation, and an inflammatory medium (IM) was obtained. Caco-2 cells were treated with 15 muL/mL ABS for 4 h, then incubated with IM. The cells also were incubated with 15 muL/mL ABS and IM together for 12 h. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) protein levels were targeted in testing inflammatory condition and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) mRNA level was used as a marker gene to show the possible anti-inflammatory effect of ABS in Caco-2 cells. TNF-alpha level was 26.1-fold higher than the control group. IM caused 3.2-fold increase in COX-2 expression in Caco-2 cells. Pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with ABS resulted in 3.3-fold decrease in COX-2 mRNA levels relative to IM group. Furthermore, COX-2 mRNA level reduced 4.7-fold when ABS and conditional medium were given at the same time. ABS has suppressive effect on COX-2 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. These results suggest that ABS might have protective and therapeutic effect for colonic inflammation.										2021	24	12	1280	1284	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.0034					FSTA:2023-01-Te0370

Evaluation of chemical and nutritional changes in chips, chicken nuggets, and broccoli after deep-frying with extra virgin olive oil, canola, and grapeseed oils.		Journal of Food Quality					The aim of this study was to assess the food nutritional profiles of potato chips, chicken nuggets, and broccoli and their palatability after deep-frying with different oils. The trials consisted of 4 cycles of deep-frying at 180 °C for 4 minutes using extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), canola, and grapeseed oils. Samples of food and oils were taken untreated and after the treatments for sensorial and chemical analysis. EVOO and canola oil deep-fried food were preferred by their colour, but canola fried food was disliked because of its flavour. Results showed that there is a transference between food and oils regarding fatty acid profile and antioxidant content as well as trans fatty acids (TFAs) and polar compounds (PCs). All food presented more antioxidants and monounsaturated fatty acids after having been cooked with EVOO than after cooking with canola and grapeseed oils. Highest PCs in food were found when using canola oil and grapeseed oils. EVOO was shown to decrease the PCs in chips and chicken nuggets. PCs were not detected in raw broccoli, and broccoli cooked in EVOO showed the lowest PCs content. Canola and grapeseed oils increased the TFAs in food, whereas EVOO decreased the TFAs in the chips and maintained the initial TFAs levels in chicken nuggets and broccoli. This study shows that EVOO improves the nutritional profile of the food when compared with canola and grapeseed oils when deep-frying without any negative impact on palatability or appearance.

Fortification of durum wheat spaghetti and common wheat bread with wheat bran protein concentrate-impacts on nutrition and technological properties.		Food Chemistry					Plant industrial by-products have generally low value but can be a good source of nutritional compounds. Wheat bran is the main by-product of wheat milling and contains >15% high-quality proteins. Extraction of wheat bran proteins (WBPC) and inclusion in spaghetti and bread formulations was studied to determine if the nutritional properties of these foods could be enhanced without deleterious effects on quality. Semolina was substituted with WBPC at 0,1, 5,10 and 20% (w/w) and made into spaghetti and a commercial bread flour was substituted with WBPC at 0,1, 5 and 10% w/w and made into bread. Both spaghetti protein content (12.3 to 23.4%) and total essential amino acids (3.76 to 7.59%) increased with added WBPC. Overall spaghetti quality was acceptable up to 10%WBPC and superior to wholemeal, especially in appearance. However, the bread formulation used was very sensitive to WBPC especially above 1% addition. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Alzuwaid, N. T.; Pleming, D.; Fellows, C. M.; Laddomada, B.; Sissons, M.							Influence of durum wheat bran particle size on phytochemical content and on leavened bread baking quality.		Foods					Wheat bran is a conventional by-product of the wheat milling industry mainly used for animal feed. It is a rich and inexpensive source of phytonutrients, so is in demand for fibre-rich food products but creates quality issues when incorporated into bread. The purpose of this study was to characterize the physicochemical properties and phytochemical composition of different size durum bran fractions and show how they impact bread quality. Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) was milled to create a coarse bran fraction (CB), which was further ground into a finer fraction (FB) which was sieved using four screens with apertures 425, 315, 250, 180, and <180 m to create a particle size range of 1497 to 115 m. All fractions contained phytosterol with highest in the 180 and FB, while total phenolic acids and antioxidant capacity was highest in CB and 425. Use of the fractions in a leavened common wheat (T. aestivum L.) bread formula at 10% incorporation negatively impacted bread loaf volume, colour, and texture compared to standard loaves, with CB having the least impact. Results. Suggest that to combine the highest phytochemical content with minimal impact on bread quality, bran particle size should be considered, with CB being the best choice. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Amado, L. R.; Silva, K. de S.; Mauro, M. A.							Drying of mangoes (Mangifera indica L. Cv. Palmer) at changeable temperature conditions-effects on energy consumption and quality of the dehydrated fruit.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This study evaluated the influence of heat input change on the drying kinetics, energy consumption, the color, and carotenoid retention during the drying of mangoes. The drying conditions in the first stage were 95 °C for 40min and 80 °C for 40min, so that the surface temperatures of the fruit at the end of this stage were around 60 °C. The temperatures of the second stage and corresponding continuous drying (control) were 70 and 60 °C. As a result, the thermal intermittence influenced the drying kinetics, causing significant reductions in the overall process time and providing energy savings when compared to continuous drying. The color parameters did not show relevant changes as result of the intermittent drying while good carotenoid retention was obtained in intermittent conditions, when the second stage was 60 °C. Therefore, the carotenes were more sensitive to a temperature of 70 °C, which highlights the importance of limiting the temperature of the mango to 60 °C during the two drying stages to better preserve the quality of the dehydrated fruit. Moreover, the high air temperatures used in the first stage were advantageous for reducing the overall process time and providing energy saving. Practical Applications. Drying is an operation well known for the food industry. However, in so many cases, dryers are not designed with energy consumption in mind. Moreover, simple procedures can bring savings in convective drying, as shown in the present study, where the application of two-stages in the convective drying of mangoes was advantageous to reduce the overall drying time and provide energy savings in relation to continuous drying. Besides that, good carotenoid retention was obtained using low temperature (60 °C) at the second stage. The results can be useful for design of dryers and drying process, considering different temperatures. Intermittent drying of high moisture foods by varying the drying air temperature can be applied both on an industrial scale, in continuous belt dryers or in tunnel dryers, and on a small scale, using two or more dryers with different temperatures. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Detection and virulence characterization of Listeria monocytogenes strains in ready-to-eat products.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					The public health risk posed by Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat (RTE) foods depends on the effectiveness of its control at every stage of the production process and the strain involved. Analytical methods currently in use are limited to the identification/quantification of L. monocytogenes at the species level, without distinguishing virulent from hypovirulent strains. In these products, according to EU Regulation 2073/2005, L. monocytogenes is a mandatory criterion irrespective of strain virulence level. Indeed, this species encompasses a diversity of strains with various pathogenic potential, reflecting genetic heterogeneity of the species itself. Thus, the detection of specific L. monocytogenes virulence genes can be considered an important target in laboratory food analysis to assign different risk levels to foods contaminated by strains carrying different genes. In 2015-2016, a severe invasive listeriosis outbreak occurred in central Italy, leading to the intensification of routine surveillance and strain characterization for virulence genetic markers. A new multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting main virulence genes has been developed and validated against the enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA) culture-based method. Results of the improved surveillance program are now reported in this study.		; pomilio, francesco/D-2309-2017	Schiavano, Giuditta Fiorella/0000-0002-1427-3486; Amagliani, Giulia/0000-0002-0547-5107; pomilio, francesco/0000-0001-6946-8603; duranti, anna/0000-0001-7392-9193							2021	18	9	675	682	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2923					FSTA:2022-02-Ge0597

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Plantain is an important food security crop for farming households in Nigeria. This study investigates the relative importance of plantain food products and their quality descriptors from the perspective of farmers in Southern-Nigeria, to inform end-user oriented and socially inclusive breeding strategies that drive hybrid adoption. Surveys were conducted in twelve rural communities in three states in the plantain belt of Nigeria, consisting of key informant interviews, sex-disaggregated focused group discussions and individual interviews. Dodo (fried plantains), boli (roasted plantains), boiled plantain, plantain with beans and porridge were the most common food products identified in the study areas. Fruit size, pulp texture (firmness/softness), colour, maturity stage and taste were identified as the most critical characteristics, with impact on quality of processed food products. There were significant differences between states regarding the importance of plantain food products, but little interstate and gender differences for fresh fruit and food product quality characteristics. © 2020 The Authors.

Molecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii and Sarcocystis spp. co-infection in Tunisian Merguez, a traditional processed sausage beef meat.		Food Control					With the increase of raw food consumption, there is a growing interest in the risk posed by zoonotic infections to human health. This study was performed to identify in popular processed beef meat-based sausages (Merguez) the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii and the zoonotic species of Sarcocystis. A total of 99 samples, collected from four Tunisian regions, were used for molecular analyses. For each sample, DNA was extracted from 4 equal pieces and PCR reactions were performed. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to identify Sarcocystis species. Prevalences of T. gondii and Sarcocystis spp. DNA in Merguez samples were 47.5% (95% CI: 0.38-0.57) and 52.5% (95% CI: 0.43-0.62), respectively. Important differences between regions were found. The DNA of both parasites was detected in 14.1% of the same samples. For Sarcocystis spp. Infection, the percentage of samples having one positive piece was significantly higher than those having two, three or four positive pieces. Whereas, for T. gondii, the majority of tested samples had two positive pieces (16.2%) (p=0.002). Sequencing showed the presence of Sarcocystis tenella and Sarcocystis cruzi species. Our findings suggest a high prevalence of T. gondii and Sarcocystis spp. In Merguez sausages with a potential high human health risk if the latter are undercooked. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of in vitro digestion on the antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitory potential of buffalo milk processed cheddar cheese.		Foods					The purpose of this study was to develop an in-vitro digestion protocol to evaluate the antioxidant potential of the peptides found in processed cheddar cheese using digestion enzymes. We first studied antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and antioxidant activities of processed cheddar cheese with the addition of spices e.g., cumin, clove, and black pepper made from buffalo milk and ripened for 9 months. Then we conducted an in vitro digestion of processed cheddar cheese by gastric and duodenal enzymes. Freeze-dried water (WSE) and ethanol-soluble fractions (ESE) of processed cheddar cheese were also monitored for their ACE inhibition activity and antioxidant activities. In our preliminary experiments, different levels of spices (cumin, clove, and black pepper) were tested into a cheese matrix and only one level 0.2 g/100 g (0.2%) based on cheese weight was considered good after sensory evaluation. Findings of the present study revealed that ACE-inhibitory potential was the highest in processed cheese made from buffalo milk with the addition of 0.2% cumin, clove, and black pepper. A significant increase in ACE-inhibition (%) of processed cheddar cheese, as well as its WSE and ESE, was obtained. Lower IC50 values were found after duodenal phase digestion compared to oral phase digestion. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Amalfitano, N.; Rosa, G. J. M.; Cecchinato, A.; Bittante, G.							Nonlinear modeling to describe the pattern of 15 milk protein and nonprotein compounds over lactation in dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					The protein profile of milk includes several caseins, whey proteins, and nonprotein nitrogen compounds, which influence milk's value for human nutrition and its cheesemaking properties for the dairy industry. To fill in the gap in current knowledge of the patterns of these individual nitrogenous compounds throughout lactation, we tested the ability of a parametric nonlinear lactation model to describe the pattern of each N compound expressed qualitatively (as% of total milk N), quantitatively (in g/L milk), and as daily yield (in g/d). The lactation model was tested on a data set of detailed milk nitrogenous compound profiles (15 fractions-12 protein traits and 3 nonproteins-for each expression mode: 45 traits) obtained from 1,342 cows reared in 41 multibreed herds. Our model was a modified version of Wilmink's model, often used for describing milk yield during lactation because of its reliability and ease of parameter interpretation from a biological point of view. We allowed the sign of the persistency coefficient (parameter c) that explained the variation in the long-term milk component (parameter a) to be positive or negative. We also allowed the short-term milk component (parameter b) to be positive or negative, and we estimated a specific speed of adaptation parameter (parameter k) for each trait rather than assumed a value a priori, as in the original model (k=0.05). These 4 parameters were included in a nonlinear mixed model with cow breed and parity order as fixed effects, and herd-date as random. Combinations of the positive and negative signs of the b and c parameters allowed us to identify 4 differently shaped lactation curves, all found among the patterns exhibited by the nitrogenous fractions as follows: the "zenith" curve (with a maximum peak; for milk yield and 10 other N traits), the "nadir" curve (with a minimum point; for 20 traits, including almost all those expressed in g/L of milk), the "downward" curve (continuously decreasing; for 14 traits, including almost all those in g/d), and the "upward" curve (continuously increasing; only for kappa-casein, in% N). Direct estimation of the k parameters specific to each trait showed the large variability in the adaptation speed of fresh cows and greatly increased the model's flexibility. The results indicated that nonlinear parametric mathematical models can effectively describe the different and complex patterns exhibited by individual nitrogenous fractions during lactation; therefore, they could be useful tools for interpreting milk composition variations during lactation.

Y.; Gang Sun							Fabrication of polydopamine-based NIR-light responsive imprinted nanofibrous membrane for effective lysozyme extraction and controlled release from chicken egg white.		Food Chemistry					The development of highly efficient performance matrix for protein adsorption and scalable throughput adsorbent is highly desired, especially in pharmaceuticals and food industries. In this work, we present a simple methodology to prepare a nanofibrous membrane based surface molecular imprinted matrix (MIP) for selective separation of lysozyme. The MIP was developed by coating carboxylated poly (vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) nanofibrous mat (EVOH-CCA NFM) with a near infrared (NIR)-light responsive polydopamine (PDA) layer. The open porous nanofibrous structure and a thin PDA layer endowed the MIPs with adsorption capacity (500 mg.g-1) within 150 min. The developed surface MIPs not only showed imprinting factor (IF=4) with reusability upon 5 cycles, but also capability of extracting lysozyme from egg-white directly. The MIPs showed controlled release of extracted lysozyme triggered by the NIR-light responsive property of the PDA layer. Moreover, the released lysozyme possesses good bioactivity, evidenced by efficient decomposition of micrococcus bacterial cell wall. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Cereal Science					The end processing quality of bread wheat is affected by several parameters such as grain texture, grain protein content, and gluten protein composition. Gluten proteins (glutenins and gliadins) are associated with bread-making quality, and among gluten proteins, high molecular weight-glutenins (HMW-GS) are considered the major determinant of bread-making quality. Wild varieties of wheat serve as sources of the novel HMW-GS alleles that can be explored to improve wheat processing quality. HMW-GS specific to one such wild relative of wheat Thinopyrum elongatum has been reported to enhance the processing quality in the background of soft textured Japanese cultivar Norin61. In this study, we tried to transfer HMW-GS from Th. Elongatum to hard textured, high yielding Indian cultivar PBW621. Two lines with different seed textures (Hard-TL and Soft-TL) were developed carrying 1EL. 1AS translocation in PBW621 background. The effect of 1EL. 1AS translocation on various quality parameters and bread-making quality was studied. Dough mixing properties, extensibility properties, and other quality parameters improved in hard and soft translocation lines. Comparing bread loaf volumes and bread quality scores suggested no significant differences in the improvement in individual quality parameters.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					In this study, zein/polylactic acid (PLA) /hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) nanofibers (NFs) were fabricated to the incorporation of Zenian (Carum copticum) essential oil (ZO) using the electrospinning method for employing in food packaging for the first time. The SEM images of optimal zein/PLA/HPMC/ZO NFs displayed homogeneous morphology. The average diameter of NFs ranged between 718 186 nm and 335 112 nm. Antioxidant activity of ZO-loaded NFs was 68.83 0.1%. The zein/PLA/HPMC/ZO NFs showed inhibiting activity versus S. aureus (15 mm) and E. coli (8 mm) bacteria. Moreover, ZO-incorporated NFs showed better thermal stability than zein/PLA/HPMC nanofibers without ZO. After loading of ZO, zein/PLA/HPMC NFs exhibited higher tensile strength than those of native nanofiber, and MTT test showed no cell toxicity which indicated good biocompatibility. Overall, the zein/PLA/HPMC/ZO NFs endorsed have good properties for application in food packaging. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	8	1529	1541	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02654-7					FSTA:2021-11-Fe3026

Effect of degree of milling and defatting on proximate composition, functional and texture characteristics of gluten-free muffin of bran of long-grain indica rice cultivars.		Food Chemistry					Effect of different degrees of milling (DoM: 2%, 4%, 6% and 8%) and defatting on the proximate composition, protein characteristics, functional properties of bran of long grain rice cultivars and texture characteristics of bran (RB) supplemented muffins were evaluated. Protein, ash content, redness and yellowness increased while fat content decreased for RB by extended DoM and defatting. A higher proportion of beta sheets, random coils, alpha-helix and beta-turns for all fractions of RB of both cultivars after defatting were also observed. Defatting and extended DoM both improved the essential amino acid content in RB. A higher level of prolamines (15-18 kDa) in RB and DF-RB of PUSA1121 than PR111 was observed. Muffins made from 2% DoM bran from PUSA1121 showed improved texture characteristics and achieved the highest score for sensory attributes. Therefore, DoM and defatting improved the proximate, protein profiling, and functionality of the different fraction of RB.

J		Amandeep Singh; Veerachandra Yemmireddy							Fate of Salmonella spp. in fresh-cut papaya (Carica papaya L.) at different storage temperature and relative humidity.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Salmonella has been a recurring issue in the papaya industry. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of post-harvest storage conditions on the growth kinetics of Salmonella in fresh-cut papaya. Papaya samples were spot inoculated with nalidixic acid adopted Salmonella spp (4-strain) at 4-5 log CFU/g and then stored in an environmental chamber at six different temperature (4,12 and 21 °C) and relative humidity (55 and 90%) combinations for up to 14 days. The levels of Salmonella and the changes in pH, TSS, color, and water activity of papaya were determined. Increasing the storage temperature from 4 to 21 °C and RH from 55 to 90% increased the log survival. However, no significant effect (P > 0.05) of RH was observed when the samples were stored either at 12 or 4 °C for 14 days. Both Baryani-Roberts (R20.794-0.975) and Biphasic models (0.793-0.975) best fitted the experimental data at the tested storage conditions. Salmonella showed a maximum growth rate ranging from-0.0207 to 0.0632 (1/h) and the highest growth rate was observed at 21 °C and 90% RH. These findings demonstrate that better control over storage temperature and RH is critical to mitigate the risk of Salmonella in papaya.

J		Amandeep Singh; Asfakur Rahman, M.; Rajat Sharma; Veerachandra Yemmireddy							Papaya ripeness and post-harvest storage conditions affect growth, survival and death kinetics of Salmonella and spoilage organisms.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of papaya ripeness level (0, 25, 50, 75 and/or 100%) and post-harvest storage conditions (i.e., Temperature: 4, 12 and 21°C, and RH: 55 and 90%) on the survival kinetics of Salmonella spp., and spoilage organisms. In addition, the effect of test conditions on the physico-chemical properties of fresh-cut papayas was also determined. Maradol papayas of different commercial ripeness levels were cut into 3 cm2 cubes either with or without a peel. The samples were spot inoculated with 25 muL of nalidixic acid adopted Salmonella spp (4-strain) to achieve 4-5 log CFU g-1. The inoculated samples and uninoculated controls were stored in an environmental chamber for up to 14 d. Papaya ripeness level in combination with storage temperature and RH have shown to affect Salmonella survival on both fresh-cut papaya and papaya peel. Increasing the fruit ripeness level from 0 to 100%, storage temperature from 4 to 21°C and RH from 55 to 90% increased the log survival. Samples at low ripeness levels showed slower growth of yeast and molds compared to samples at higher ripeness levels. Ripeness levels also showed an effect on the total soluble solids content of fresh-cut papaya during the storage. Based on these findings, papaya ripeness level in combination with post-harvest storage conditions need to be considered to maximize the microbiological safety while maintaining the quality.

Changes in quality attributes and volatile profile of ready-to-eat "Gabsi" pomegranate arils as affected by storage duration and temperatures.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Maintaining the cold chain during long-term storage is important for the preservation of fresh food quality. Arils are usually extracted from freshly harvested pomegranates or after short storage period. Nevertheless, pomegranate fruit may be stored for several weeks before being marketed as ready-to-eat aril (REA). In this study, the effect of different postharvest storage periods (30,45, and 60 days) and temperatures (2°C and 6°C) on the quality of arils after storage of fruit and then after 10 days storage were investigated. The fruit storage period significantly affected total phenols, antioxidant activity, and vitamin C content of REA from stored fruit and after 10 days storage. Color, anthocyanins, and organic acids of REA varied significantly with the fruit storage period mainly after 10 days. The highest changes were observed after 60 days of fruit storage period. Generally, storage temperature has no effect on bioactive properties and has minimal influence on REA after 10 days storage period. Sensory and volatiles changes were affected not only by storage temperature but also by long storage duration. Thus, aroma profile was markedly separated in heatmap by storage time and temperature. Similar aroma profiles for REA extracted immediately after each storage period or from freshly harvested fruit were distinguished. However, changes were observed for stored fruit after 10 days storage at 6°C, with more abundance of terpenes such as (Z)-beta-farenesene, (E)-alpha-bergamotene, and alpha-pinene. Practical applications. Ready-to-eat arils (REA) quality is generally affected by several postharvest treatments and conditions. This study used a combination of storage temperatures and duration of "Gabsi" pomegranate fruit to determine the quality of arils after shelf-life. Results of aril sensory analysis showed that the overall flavor and appearance were highly rated in aril when the fruit was stored for 2 months at 2°C. Similarly, results of instrumental measurements showed that the fruit could be stored for 2 months at 2°C without significant reduction in compounds that are beneficial for health and aril color. Storing fruit for 60 days at 6°C led to a reduction in overall quality and changes in aroma profile of REA. The outcomes of this study suggest that a storage period of 2 months at 2°C is recommended for REA aril use to maintain sensory quality and minimize volatile aroma component reductions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.14415					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0162

Extraction, characterization and gelling ability of pectins from Araca (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) fruits.		Food Hydrocolloids					Pectins from Araca (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) fruit pulp were extracted, purified and isolated, obtaining the Araca Purified Pectin (APP) under its sodium form. Yield was found 3.5% w/w of the initial dried material. From titration, monosaccharide analysis after total hydrolysis and1H and HSQC NMR analyses, it was established that the pectins are formed of long galacturonic acid blocks (HG) partially methylated (degree of methyl-esterification-DM = 55.9 mol%) and acetylated (2 mol%) and RG-I blocks with side chains containing mainly arabinose and galactose. No gelation was observed in presence of calcium for the unmodified APP. Then, pectins were treated in alkaline conditions to de-esterify progressively the initial sample down to DM = 0 after 60 min of treatment. Each sample obtained was characterized by SEC and NMR demonstrating the stability of the main chains, where Rha, GalA and Mw remained unchanged independently of the length of alkaline treatment. One of this sample (APP-15) was selected to test the gelling ability and rheological behavior. The gel was formed by dialysis against 1 mol L-1 CaCl2 and its rheological study allows to conclude that a homogeneous physical gel is formed stabilized by cooperative GalA--Ca+2 junctions.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Impact on chemical properties, viscosity, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition (FAC) of 10 vegetable oil blends (VOBs) following intermittent frying of chickpea splits was studied. The peroxide (PV), p-Anisidine (p-AV), acid (AV) value, and viscosity of VOBs increased, while oxidative stability index (OSI) decreased by increasing frying cycles (FCs). VOB-3 and VOB-7 exhibited a minimum change in PV, AV, p-AV, viscosity, and OSI with an increment in FCs. Oil uptake increased with an increment in FCs and the lowest change observed in VOB-3 (6.0%-13.7%). VOB-7, VOB-8, and VOB-6 exhibited lower changes in omega6/omega3 ratio, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids contents, respectively with an increment in FCs. VOB-5 and VOB-9 exhibited higher variation in FAC and FTIR peaks while atherogenic and thrombogenic index of VOBs varied slightly with an increment in FCs. Based on the results, VOB-3 and VOB-7 were found suitable for intermittent frying of chickpea splits. Practical applications. Vegetable oil blends suitable for deep fat frying were identified by comparing quality and stability characteristics of 10 VOBs during intermittent frying of chickpea splits. VOB-3 (CNO+ SBO [80:20]) and VOB-7 (CNO+ RBO+ SBO [60:20:20]) exhibited minimum changes in chemical properties, viscosity, and OSI with an increment in FCs and had balanced FAC (omega6/omega3 ratio). Thus, VOB-3 and VOB-7 are suitable for intermittent frying among the studied VOBs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16015					FSTA:2022-04-Jp4656

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present research aimed to study the effect of Ohmic heating (OH) treatment on textural degradation and as a pretreatment step prior to drying freshly cut pineapple (Anana comosus) cubes. The fresh samples were heated up to 90 °C with electric field strength (EFS: 25, 30, 35 V/cm) for a time duration (60, 90, 120, 150, 180 s), and the textural degradation and color changes were studied. The OH treated samples were dried in a tray drier at 70 °C with an airflow of 0.1 m3/s and the rehydration of these dehydrated samples was carried out at room temperature (251 °C) for 7 h in distilled water. It was found that the maximum textural degradation occurred with the treatment time 90 and 120 s for the respective EFS. The effective moisture diffusivity during drying of the OH treated samples was found to be in the range of 1.91*10-8 to 2.30*10-8 m2/s. Non-significant differences of % mass gain and rehydration ratio were observed to increase treatment time at p > 0.05. Based on the current study, OH heating can be used as an alternative to conventional blanching of fruits and vegetables prior to drying and storing.

J		Amare, M.; Abay, K. A.; Tiberti, L.; Chamberlin, J.							COVID-19 and food security: panel data evidence from Nigeria.		Food Policy					This paper combines pre-pandemic face-to-face survey data with follow up phone surveys collected in April-May 2020 to examine the implication of the COVID-19 pandemic on household food security and labor market participation outcomes in Nigeria. To examine these relationships and implications, we exploit spatial variation in exposure to COVID-19 related infections and lockdown measures, along with temporal differences in our outcomes of interest, using a difference-in-difference approach. We find that households exposed to higher COVID-19 case rates or mobility lockdowns experience a significant increase in measures of food insecurity. Examining possible transmission channels for this effect, we find that the spread of the pandemic is associated with significant reductions in labor market participation. For instance, lockdown measures are associated with 6-15 percentage points increase in households' experience of food insecurity. Similarly, lockdown measures are associated with 12 percentage points reduction in the probability of participation in non-farm business activities. These lockdown measures have limited implications on wage-related activities and farming activities. In terms of food security, households relying on non-farm businesses, poorer households, and those living in remote and conflicted-affected zones have experienced relatively larger deteriorations in food security. These findings can help inform immediate and medium-term policy responses, including social protection policies aiming at ameliorating the impacts of the pandemic. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Shelf life of extra virgin olive oil manufactured with combined microwaves and megasonic waves at industrial scale.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Previous research has demonstrated that the innovative application of combined microwaves and megasonic waves for preconditioning olive paste enabled olive oil production in continuous mode, while delivering higher olive oil yields. The present work further examines the impact of these technologies on the chemical and sensory stability of the oils obtained in previous studies, with reference to international extra virgin olive oil standards. Olive oil samples obtained after traditional malaxation (Control), microwave conditioning (MW), traditional malaxation assisted with megasonics (MS), and the combination of both microwave conditioning followed by megasonics (MW+ MS) in a commercial olive oil plant at 350 kg/h, were characterised and evaluated across 1 year at 3-month intervals. All oil samples evaluated met the international extra virgin olive oil standard parameters across the shelf life study. Ethyl esters and waxes increased uniformly across storage indicating no effect of MW or MS on fermentation processes during conditioning. The application of these technologies enhanced the phenolic content in the oils across one-year, with fluctuations among technologies, in comparison to the traditional control process (Control < MWMSMW+ MS). Overall, this study demonstrates that both MW and MS conditioning technologies and their combination, applied industrially, can create higher quality extra virgin olive oils across storage.

Food & Function					Obesity is associated with an increased risk of an iron deficiency; however, a synergistic relationship between iron and lipid homeostasis was also observed. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of pharmacological doses of iron supplementation on omega 3 (n-3) and omega 6 (n-6) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were fed a normal diet or a 50% high-fat diet (HFD) without or with pharmacological doses of ferric citrate (0.25,1, or 2 g ferric iron per kg diet) for 12 weeks, and erythrocyte profiles of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were quantitated. Ferric citrate supplementation showed dose-related effects on liver inflammation, liver iron accumulation, and increasing circulating levels of iron, erythrocyte degradation biomarkers LVV-hemorphin-7, malondialdehyde (MDA), and insulin. Obese rats supplemented with 2 g ferric iron per kg diet also had decreased levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and total n-3 PUFAs compared to rats fed a normal diet or HFD alone. A western blotting analysis revealed that iron-mediated downregulation of n-3 PUFA-converting enzymes (Delta5 and Delta6 desaturases) only occurred at high dosages (≥1 g ferric iron per kg diet). A Spearman correlation analysis showed that total liver iron and serum LVV-hemorphin-7 and MDA were negatively correlated with n-3 PUFAs and their converting enzymes (Delta5 and Delta6 desaturases) (all p< 0.05). In conclusion, obese rats that received high-dose ferric citrate supplementation (>1 g of ferric iron per kg diet) exhibited decreased n-3 PUFA levels via downregulation of expressions of Delta5 and Delta6 desaturase enzymes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	23	11819	11828	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02680a					FSTA:2022-03-Aj4612

Food Science & Nutrition					Textural, physicochemical, and sensory characteristics of rice-based gluten-free bread in the presence of acorn flour; inulin and different fermentation type (yeast starter fermentation [Y] or mixed fermentation based on sourdough [MF-SD]) were investigated. Acorn flour was added to replace rice flour at a proportion of 10, 30, and 50% W/W. Furthermore, the mixture flour was replaced by inulin as a functional prebiotic ingredient at 10% W/W. Considering results obtained at this study, using mixed fermentation based on sourdough and inulin at 10% W/W provide the structure able to restore gases through baking process at formulations containing acorn flour at 30% W/W (A30R70SL). The highest specific volume (1.47 0.04cm3 g-1) and the lowest hardness (40.97 0.87 N) are observed in A30R70SL which seems to be induced by its potential to form gel. Acorn flour substitution level at 50% W/W adversely influenced the technological characteristics of final product and its perception by the consumer. Acorn flour substitution up to 30% W/W is preferred by the consumer which is attributed to its potential role to improve the unpleasant pale color of rice-based gluten-free products. A negatively significant correlation has been observed between the color perception by the consumer and crumb lightness (r = -.493, p ≤ .05). © 2021 The Authors.

Evaluation of potentially probiotic Lactobacillus casei CSL3 immobilized on oats and applied to yogurt production.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The study aimed to evaluate the viability of Lactobacillus casei CSL3 immobilized on oat flakes applied to yogurt. Oat flakes were used as the support for L. casei CSL3, and the viability of the stored biocatalyst was evaluated at 4 °C and -18 °C, lyophilized and non-lyophilized, for 60 days. Two formulations of yogurt were produced: free L. casei CSL3 (YCL) and L. casei CSL3 immobilized on oat flakes (YCLI). Physical-chemical analyses, cellular viability, gastrointestinal tract (GIT) simulations and sensorial tests were performed. Immobilization combined with storage temperature (4 °C) maintained the viability of the probiotic for 60 days. The YCLI presented bacterial viability at 4 °C on the 25th day. GIT simulation showed reduction in the gastric phase, reaching a greater concentration in the ileum for YCLI. YCLI yogurt presented high protein content and high sensory acceptance by consumers, indicating a potential for commercialization. Practical applications.

Effect of processing on oat beta-glucan viscosity, postprandial glycemic response and subjective measures of appetite.		Food & Function					Oat has procured its acclaim as a health promoting food partially due to its positive effect on glucose control. It has been demonstrated that oat beta-glucan can interfere with postprandial glucose response. A large majority of this action is attributed to the increase in viscosity due to the beta-glucan content in oat foods. While it is known that an increase in viscosity due to higher molecular weight of beta-glucan can improve its glycemic effects, it is not known if an increase in viscosity attained by processing variables can further enhance the positive effect of oat on glucose control. In the current study we have examined the effect of kilning, tempering, microwaving, cooking, soaking and flaking on oat beta-glucan viscosity. An acute randomized crossover clinical trial was also conducted to test oatmeal products containing low, medium and high beta-glucan viscosity for their effect on postprandial glycemic response. Results from the processing experiments demonstrate that kilned samples, when tempered to 25% moisture and microwaved for 2 minutes, can produce much higher final viscosity compared to other samples with similar beta-glucan content, molecular weight and solubility. However, results from the clinical trial show that the increase in the viscosity of the oat beta-glucan attained through processing in this study did not have any effect on postprandial glucose control. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	8	3672	3679	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03283b					FSTA:2021-09-Mg5326

Part 3: spatial evolution of bread staling with time by near infrared hyperspectral imaging.		Food Chemistry					This paper explores how the staling of white bread affects the behavior of the whole crumb surface and how that mechanism is interrupted/changed by the addition of maltogenic alpha-amylases. This is done using near infrared hyperspectral imaging, machine learning methodologies and the knowledge acquired in the previous two manuscripts. Methods like principal component analysis and multivariate curve resolution demonstrate how the constituents of the bread being stored (for 21 days) evolve differently depending on the presence/absence of maltogenic alpha-amylases and also which parts of the crumb are primarily exposed to changes. The spatial distribution of the hardness is calculated in the entire surface of the slice area during staling by using partial least square regression. This manuscript comprehends one of the largest studies made on white bread staling and proposes a complete methodology using near infrared hyperspectral imaging and machine learning.

J		Amin Ghahramanifar; Masoud Taghizadeh; Mahmoud Mousavi, S.							Separation of tomato aroma compounds from binary model solutions using PEBA and EPDM membranes in pervaporation: comparison of membranes performance and investigation of temperature effect.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The pervaporation separation of four important aroma compounds of tomato juice (1-hexanol, hexanal, 2-heptenal, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one) was investigated. Ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM) and polyether block amide (PEBA) membranes were fabricated and applied to treat binary model solutions containing one of the aroma compounds in water. Results. Showed that at 25°C, PEBA membrane had higher total flux, organic flux, and pervaporation separation index (PSI) than EPDM membrane, while EPDM performed better in terms of separation factor. For PEBA, the highest total flux (395.93g/m2hr) was observed in separating 1-hexanol, and for EPDM, the highest total flux (116.82g/m2hr) was seen in treating 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one/water at 25°C. Furthermore, the impact of feed temperature on pervaporation performance was investigated. A rise from 25 to 45°C increased the total and organic fluxes for both of the membranes. The separation factors of PEBA and EPDM changed differently with temperature; higher temperatures led to improved separation factor for PEBA and reduced separation factor for EPDM. Moreover, increased feed temperature improved PSI for both membranes, while the change was more significant for PEBA. Practical applications. In this study, for the first time, tomato aroma compounds have been separated from their aqueous solutions in a pervaporation process. The findings obtained by the present research can be employed by any plant which processes tomato enabling them the use of aroma compounds in order to reach value added products and therefore increase worth of processing outputs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	12			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13885					FSTA:2022-03-Hq2629
J		Amin Karimi; Ahmadi Gavlighi, H.; Amini Sarteshnizi, R.; Chibuike C. Udenigwe							Effect of maize germ protein hydrolysate addition on digestion, in vitro antioxidant activity and quality characteristics of bread.		Journal of Cereal Science					This study investigated the fortification of bread with 1, 2, and 4 g/100 g of maize germ protein hydrolysate (MGPH) for enhancement of in vitro antioxidant potential of the bread before and after digestion and alpha-amylase inhibition during digestion. Furthermore, color, moisture content and texture profile of the fortified bread were assessed. Hydrolysate addition at 4 g/100 g increased DPPH scavenging activity and Fe2+ chelating activity of the bread ~2.3 and 2.1 times compared to control, respectively. After simulated digestion, DPPH scavenging activity increased ~4 time while the Fe2+ chelating activity decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The starch digestion rate decreased with increasing MGPH concentration, especially in the first 20 min of in vitro digestion. MGPH improved the bread texture during storage with reductions in hardness and chewiness. Sensory evaluation showed that the addition of MGPH to the bread only affected the aroma significantly (p < 0.05). Taken together, it can be concluded that maize germ protein hydrolysate can be used as a functional component and bread is potentially an appropriate vehicle for delivery of the biofunctional peptides.

J		Amin Khatibi, S.; Ali Ehsani; Mahboob Nemati; Afshin Javadi							Microencapsulation of Zataria multiflora Boiss. essential oil by complex coacervation using gelatin and gum arabic: characterization, release profile, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The microcapsules containing " Zataria multiflora" Boiss. essential oil (ZMEO) were prepared by complex coacervation using gelatin and gum arabic. The transglutaminase was utilized as a cross-linking agent. The characteristics and release profile of microcapsules were investigated using different core/wall ratios, concentrations of cross-linking agent, and hardening time. The antimicrobial activity of microcapsules was also studied against foodborne microorganisms. The microcapsule with a core/wall ratio of 2:1 had the highest size and encapsulation efficiency. The contents of carvacrol and thymol in microcapsules were higher than it was in free oil. The lowest cumulative release of ZMEO (only 14.49%) was observed at 4 °C. The controlled release of oil was improved by increasing the concentration of cross-linking agent and cross-linking time. Microencapsulation of the ZMEO could improve its antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. The results of the present study confirm the suitability of ZMEO microcapsules for food preservation. Novelty impact statement: In this study, the sustained release, encapsulation efficiency as well as antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of coacervate microcapsules containing ZMEO were improved by the optimization of production parameters. The coacervate microcapsules of ZMEO synthesized in this study can be utilized as a novel preservative in the food industry. The results of this study can also be used for the encapsulation of other bioactive compounds to improve their bioavailability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15823					FSTA:2022-01-Tb0239

Abdel-Wahhab							Monitoring of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and probabilistic health risk assessment in yogurt and butter in Iran.		Food Science & Nutrition					This study was conducted to determine the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels and health risk of yogurt and butter samples collected from Tehran using MSPE/GC-MS (magnetic solid-phase extraction/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry). The results revealed that the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) were ranged from 0.040 to 0.060 and 0.121 to 0.181 mug/kg, respectively; with recoveries ranged from 86.1% to 100.3%. The highest mean of total PAHs was higher in butter (6.871.21 mug/kg) than in yogurt (3.820.54 mug/kg). The level of benzo (a) pyrene in all samples was lower than of standard levels of the European Union (EU). The highest value of all PAHs in samples was recorded in the winter season and also in the expiration date. The percentile 95% of the total hazard quotient (THQ) due to the consumption of yogurt and butter recorded 1.33E-02 and 3.69E-04 in adults and 6.12E-02 and 1.75E-03 in children, respectively. The percentile of 95% incremental lifetime of cancer risk (ILCR) due to the ingestion of yogurt and butter recorded 1.17E-06 and 2.02E-08 for adults and 5.51E-06 and 9.46E-08 for children, respectively. The rank order of 7 PAHs in adult and children based on P95% Hazard Quotient (HQ) in all samples was benzo (a) anthracene (BaA) > pyrene (P) > fluorene (F) > fluoranthene (Fl) > acenaphthylene (Ace) > anthracene (A) > naphthalene (NA). According to the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method, health-risk assessment showed that children and adults are not at significant health risk. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Amin, M. D.; Badruddoza, S.; McCluskey, J. J.							Predicting access to healthful food retailers with machine learning.		Food Policy					Many U.S. Households lack access to healthful food and rely on inexpensive, processed food with low nutritional value. Surveying access to healthful food is costly and finding the factors that affect access remains convoluted owing to the multidimensional nature of socioeconomic variables. We utilize machine learning with census tract data to predict the modified Retail Food Environment Index (mRFEI), which refers to the percentage of healthful food retailers in a tract and agnostically extract the features of no access-corresponding to a "food desert" and low access-corresponding to a "food swamp." Our model detects food deserts and food swamps with a prediction accuracy of 72% out of the sample. We find that food deserts and food swamps are intrinsically different and require separate policy attention. Food deserts are lightly populated rural tracts with low ethnic diversity, whereas swamps are predominantly small, densely populated, urban tracts, with more non-white residents who lack vehicle access. Overall access to healthful food retailers is mainly explained by population density, presence of black population, property value, and income. We also show that our model can be used to obtain sensible predictions of access to healthful food retailers for any U.S. Census tract. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Survival and growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus in ready-to-eat Mediterranean vegetable salads: impact of storage temperature and food matrix.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					This study aimed to evaluate the survival or growth behavior of L. monocytogenes and S. aureus in ready-to-eat vegetable salads including Arabic salad (tomato-cucumber salad) with or without 0.5% (w/w) salt and 1% (v/w) lemon juice, tahini salad, coleslaw salad, toum sauce salad (aioli) stored at 4, 10, and 24 °C for 5 d. L. monocytogenes showed greater growth or survival in all types of salads at all temperatures tested. L. monocytogenes grew in Arabic salad without additives at 10 °C and tahini salad at 4 and 10 °C. L. monocytogenes survived all preparation and storage conditions used in the current study and its numbers were detectable in all types of salads tested, and with a maximum reduction of 3.0 log CFU/g, except for toum sauce salad at 24 °C, the cells were not detected using enrichment broth. In addition, S. aureus survived in Arabic salad with or without additives and in tahini salad with a maximum reduction of 2.3 log CFU/g. However, S. aureus numbers sharply decreased in coleslaw and toum sauce salad and at 5 d they reached undetectable levels (≥2 log CFU/g) in coleslaw at 24 °C and in toum sauce at 10 and 24 °C. Addition of lemon juice and salt to Arabic salad significantly reduced the numbers of both pathogens.

J		Amin Nikkhah; Saeed Firouzi; Dadaei, K.; Haute, S. van							Measuring circularity in food supply chain using life cycle assessment; refining oil from olive kernel.		Foods					Valorization of food waste is a potential strategy toward a circular food supply chain. In this regard, measuring the circularity of food waste valorization systems is highly important to better understand multiple environmental impacts. Therefore, this study investigated the circularity of a food waste valorization system (refining oil from olive kernel) using a life cycle assessment methodology. An inventory of an industrial-based olive kernel oil production system is also provided in this study. The system boundary was the cradle to the factory gate of the production system. The results indicated that natural gas consumption was the highest contributor to most of the investigated impact categories. The global warming potential of one kg of oil produced from olive kernel was calculated to be 1.37 kg CO2eq. Moreover, the calculated damages of 1 kg oil production from olive kernel to human health, ecosystem quality, and resource depletion were 5.29*10-7 DALY, 0.12 PDF.m2.yr., and 24.40 MJ, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in essential oil content and the main components of mint (Mentha aquatica L.) during thin-layer drying process. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on radial basis functions was used to model the relationships between drying temperature and different drying time (independent variables) and essential oil content and main essential oil compounds of mint (dependent variables). Results. Of gas chromatography with flame ionization detectior (GC-FID) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses showed linalyl acetate, 1, 8-cineol, and linalool are the most abundant constituents of essential oil. Inverse multiquadrics model was the best model to predict the percentage of linalyl acetate, 1, 8-cineol, and essential oil content, whereas Gaussian model was the best to predict linalool. The efficiency of the selected models was acquired with R2 of 0.9658, 0.9514, 0.9568, and 0.9828 for essential oil content, linalyl acetate, linalool, and 1, 8-cineol, respectively. Practical applications. Results. Suggest that essential oil content M. aquatica and its main constituents can be scaled-up by optimizing drying time and temperature. The superior ability of RSM for modeling and monitoring of essential oil content and main components of M. aquatica during drying process as a rapid, accurate, nondestructive, and online method was also observed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15515					FSTA:2021-10-Te3907
J		Amini, R. K.; Kitamura, Y.; Zohurul Islam, M.; Kokawa, M.; Eseese, V. F.							Impact of micro wet milling process on pomegranate peel phenolics extraction using multi-response optimization.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Pomegranate peel is a rich source of various phenolics. Many extraction methods were developed and utilized for pomegranate peel extraction (PPE) with varying effect on its bioactive compounds. We hypothesized that micro wet milling (MWM) can be used to extract such compounds from fresh peel without drying to powder, as their particle size is reduced to micrometers. This will preserve the bioactive compounds as no heat treatment is involved in this proposed extraction method. To assess the MWM extraction process, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the optimum extraction conditions. The main influential factors such as rotational speed (RS) 20-50rpm, solid to solvent ratio (SS) 5-30g/100 mL, and ethanol to water ratio (EW) 30-80% were optimized for total phenolic content (TPC), total anthocyanin content (TAC), punicalagin, ellagic acid (EA), gallic acid (GA), catechin, and epicatechin. The optimum operational conditions were 50 rpm of RS, 19.62 g/100mL of SS, and 49.65% v/v of EW. The most significant influential factor for pomegranate peel extraction was SS. The optimum phenolic compound values were 225.7mg GAE/g dw of TPC, 3.1mg/g dw of TAC, 71.6mg/g dw of punicalagin, 6.9mg/g dw of ellagic acid, 6.2mg/g dw of gallic acid, 13.1mg/g dw of catechin and 14.8mg/g dw of epicatechin. Validation of the model and its comparison with the results obtained from the ultrasonic bath extraction method and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that MWM can be used to mill the peel into micro-scale particles making the extraction of pomegranate peel phenolics easier. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	3	2865	2876	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00853-6					FSTA:2021-11-Jg15230

Udenigwe							Influence of fish protein hydrolysate-pistachio green hull extract interactions on antioxidant activity and inhibition of alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and DPP-IV enzymes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study investigated the effects of protease type (Alcalase, papain and pepsin), fractionation (2 and 10 kDa nominal molecular weight cutoff) and pistachio green hull (PGH) extract addition on antioxidant activity (DPPH radical scavenging and metal chelating activity), alpha-glucosidase, alpha-amylase, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory activity of Sind sardine hydrolysates. Papain led to the highest degree of hydrolysis and antioxidant activity and the addition of PGH enhanced the bioactivity. Hydrolysates and fractions had stronger inhibition of alpha-amylase than alpha-glucosidase, and hydrolysates from papain and Alcalase were more active than those from pepsin against alpha-amylase. Interaction of PGH and the hydrolysates/peptidic fractions resulted in a decrease in alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition. The kinetics of alpha-amylase inhibition with papain hydrolysates and papain-PGH showed competitive inhibition. Hydrolysates and fractions also significantly inhibited DPP-IV, but PGH did not inhibit the enzyme or change the inhibitory effect of the hydrolysates and fractions (P ≥ 0.05). Furthermore, the highest surface hydrophobicity was observed for the >10 kDa fractions and the values increased by the addition of PGH to the hydrolysates. Therefore, PGH-hydrolysate interaction improved only the antioxidant capacity of the protein hydrolysates with nil or negative effects on the enzyme inhibition.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The effects of sonication duration (15 and 30 min) and papain enzyme treatments on the conformational, physicochemical and functional traits of myofibrillar proteins (MPs) were addressed in this study. As the ultrasound duration was increased, the water holding capacity (WHC), solubility, foaming and emulsifying properties were improved as a result of the changes in the particles size distribution and zeta potential. Our results indicated that the turbulence force caused increments in the surface hydrophobicity and significant changes in the secondary structure. Also, the rheological properties were influenced by both cavitation force and papain treatment. According to the observations, the samples treated with sonication (for 15 and 30 min) and enzyme were more elastic with higher viscosity, as compared to the control. Compared with the control, enzymolyzed samples indicated better functionality. Moreover, papain treatment led to the increase of the hydrophobicity groups on the surface of proteins and the decrease of the amount of alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures. It was noteworthy that the most changes in the structure and techno-functionality of myofibrillar proteins were observed for the sample affected by the simultaneous application of papain treatment and 15 min sonication. The highest values in the surface hydrophobicity, specific surface area, net charge, storage modulus, solubility and WHC belonged to this sample. However, enzyme-modified samples exposed to the longer sonication time (30 min) demonstrated reductions in solubility, WHC and surface hydrophobicity, as well as increases in the particle size distribution and protein turbidity.

Shelf life extension of apricot fruit by application of nanochitosan emulsion coatings containing pomegranate peel extract.		Food Chemistry					The effect of nanochitosan coating containing pomegranate peel extract (PPE) at concentrations 0.5, 0.75 and 1% (w/v) on postharvest quality of apricot fruit was studied during storage at 4 °C for 30 days. Nanoemulsions showed significant increase in droplet diameter 275-400 nm, decrease in zeta potential-30-23 mV and viscosity 90-76 mPas-1 with increase in PPE concentration. Results. Confirmed that apricot fruit treated with chitosan and 1% PPE showed significantly reduced decay percentage, weight loss, effectively retained DPPH radical scavenging activity, ascorbic acid, kept titratable acidity and firmness at high level than untreated fruit. Color attributes showed decrease in L*, a* values and significant increase in b* value. Nanochitosan containing 1% PPE significantly inhibited total psychrophilic bacterial count, yeast and mold count during storage. Our results suggest that chitosan coatings enriched with pomegranate peel extract has the potential to preserve the quality and extend shelf life of apricot.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A method for polypyrrole (PPy) fiber fabrication through a simple and quick one-step electrodeposition process was developed. 3-Hydroxy-4-nitroso-2,7-naphthalenedisulfonic acid was used as an anion dopant for the first time. It was applied for headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) of diazinon (DZN) and chlorpyrifos (CPF). A gas chromatography equipped with mass spectrometry was employed for isolation and single ion monitoring of DZN and CPF. Under optimal conditions, linear regressions in the concentration ranges of 0.25-300 ng mL-1 (R2> 0.99) were achieved. The limits of detection of DZN and CPF were found to be 0.02 and 0.03 ng mL-1, respectively. The developed HS-SPME was employed for analysis of DZN and CPF in five real samples (well water, commercial apple and grape juices, and natural apple and tomato juices). The attained relative recovery values (94.2-104.4%) verified that this methodology has acceptable capability to determine trace amounts of organophosphorus presides in real samples.

Journal of Food Quality					The presence of steroid hormones in milk is inevitable, and they can be considered as potential carcinogenic agents for consumers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and hydroxyprogesterone in sixty-nine bovine milk samples, collected from April to September 2020, in Hamadan, Iran. The milk samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In this study, the mean contents of 17beta-estradiol, progesterone, and hydroxyprogesterone in the milk samples were determined to be 330.5190.2 pg/ml, 3.572.47ng/ml, and 1.540.41ng/ml, respectively. However, the content of these steroid hormones in milk samples could be considered safe in children and adults, if the milk consumption is assumed to be in the reported range (175-240ml/daily). Due to the effects of steroid hormones, especially 17beta-estradiol, in the etiology of various cancers, regular monitoring of these hormones is recommended in milk and its dairy products in Iran.

J		Amir Pourfarzad; Alireza Yousefi; Komla Ako							Steady/dynamic rheological characterization and FTIR study on wheat starch-sage seed gum blends.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, the interactions of wheat starch (WS) (5%, w/w) with sage seed gum (SSG) (0-0.50%, w/w) were explored by steady and dynamic rheological tests and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy measurements as well. Higher levels of SSG incorporation resulted in increase in limiting strain (gammaL, up to 137%), yield stress at the limit of the linear viscoelastic (LVE) range (tauy, up to 852%) and flow-point stress (tauf, up to 3083%) values. WS-SSG blends indicated an intermediate behaviour between a weak gel and a strong elastic gel (tan (delta)=0.17-0.40). All blends exhibited shear-thinning and thixotropic flow behaviours, which were intensified at higher concentration of SSG. More SSG incorporation caused increase in the yield stress values achieved from the stress ramp method by 4308%. A bigger particle size was observed in the presence of 0.50% SSG. According to FTIR spectra, interactions between starch and SSG was promoted with increasing of SSG in the models. When SSG was added to starch, connection between water and-COO-groups resulted in the blocking of the interactions among SSG chains and amylose, and the interactions amid SSG chains. The changes in starch structure were assessed focusing on the intensity ratio of the bands at 1047 and 1022 cm-1 which represents the amount of ordered starch to amorphous starch. In the first and fifth days of storage, this ratio for control sample was higher than that of the samples containing SSG.

J		Amir Pourfarzad; Aysan Yousefi							Effect of different excipients on physicochemical properties of the functional rice bran tablet: univariate and multivariate studies on a novel food supplement.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Nowadays, consumers pay attention to the health-related properties of the food as well as their nutritional worth. Rice bran includes high amounts of proteins, fats, minerals, B vitamins and dietary fibers. These properties can contribute to health enhancement through declining the rate of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, renal stones and hyperlipidemia. In this study, the influence of gelatin, xanthan, and guar gums (at 0,5, and 10%) on the physicochemical, shelf life, sensory and image properties of functional rice bran tablets was investigated. The results displayed that the gums addition leads to changes of tablets chemical properties. The acidity and peroxide content of the gum-containing samples was significantly lower than the control sample. The highest amount of disintegration time, hardness and moisture content was observed in samples containing 10% xanthan in first and 30th days of storage. Sensory analysis revealed that gelatin, xanthan and guar did not significantly affect the color, aroma, taste and flavor of the rice bran tablets. Sensory panelists liked the samples containing 10% xanthan in terms of texture and overall acceptance as an excellent food supplement. Principal component analysis (PCA) allowed categorizing specialties. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were applied to find out the relationships between sensory and instrumental data. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1359	1369	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00740-6					FSTA:2021-10-Me6160
J		Amir Pourfarzad; Taleb Derakhshan, N.							Effect of xanthan, guar and tragacanth on quality and shelf life of hazelnut sauce: study with generalized regression, PCA and PLSR techniques.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Nut sauce can be used as a functional food substitute for mayonnaise. This study is thus aimed to investigate the effects of xanthan, guar and tragacanth hydrocolloids on the physicochemical properties and sensory characteristics of hazelnut sauce. For this purpose, various contents of the mentioned compounds (0, 0.25. 0.5, 0.75 and 1g/100g) were employed in the hazelnut sauce formulation. The moisture content, pH, acidity, viscosity, texture parameters, sensory specifications, and stability of the samples were evaluated during 90 days of storage. The results indicated a significant decline in the acidity of the samples upon increasing the hydrocolloid level. The moisture content (47.46-53.93g/100g), hardness (0.32-4.07 N), adhesiveness (0.1-2.14 N. S), and viscosity (0.0007-7.554 Pa. S) of the samples were also significantly increased by the addition of hydrocolloids. Among hydrocolloid-containing samples, the highest and the lowest stability were observed in the samples treated with xanthan (93.41%) and guar (93.13%). The sensory analysis indicated that the incorporation of the hydrocolloids significantly enhanced all the sensory aspects of the hazelnut sauce compared to the control. Pearson's correlation and principal component analysis (PCA) provided a better understanding of the relationships between underlying features. The partial least squares regression (PLSR) models were applied to find the relationships between instrumental and sensory descriptive data. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5008	5020	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01078-3					FSTA:2022-07-Tc2808
J		Amir Rezvankhah; Saeid Yarmand, M.; Babak Ghanbarzadeh; Homaira Mirzaee							Generation of bioactive peptides from lentil protein: degree of hydrolysis, antioxidant activity, phenol content, ACE-inhibitory activity, molecular weight, sensory, and functional properties.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study aimed to hydrolyze lentil protein from two hydrolysis stages: single and sequential hydrolysis using Alcalase (1, 2, and 4% w/w enzyme to substrate (E:S)) and Flavourzyme (2% w/w) through a processing time of 180min with an interval of 30min, and then, degree of hydrolysis (DH), antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activities, phenolic compounds, amino acid composition, molecular weight (MW) distribution, molecular weight profile, sensory, and functional properties were evaluated. The highest DH (47.05%), ACE-inhibitory (0.25mg/mL), and phenolic compounds (3.84mg GAE/g) were obtained when sequential hydrolysis was accomplished at Alcalase and Flavourzyme concentrations of 2% w/w and hydrolysis time of 120 and 60min, respectively. Hydrolysis did not change the main amino acid profile. Despite this, the amino acids which contribute to umami taste were increased after hydrolysis. According to Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results, the lowest MW peptides were produced by sequential hydrolysis which was agreed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (4.4 kDa and 100 Da). Sensorial analysis indicated that peptides produced by Alcalase at 1% w/w concentration with hydrolysis time of 180min (Al-1%-180min, DH value of 15.72%) had the highest bitter taste and further hydrolysis led to reduction of bitter taste and sweetness was increased for Flavourzyme (Fl-2%-180min) and also sequential hydrolysis produced peptides. Alcalase digests indicated higher solubility than control and Flavourzyme digest. The emulsifying activity index (EAI) was decreased (35.2 to 21.5%) while Foaming capacity (FC) was increased (80 to 104.76%) by Alcalase hydrolysis. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5021	5035	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01077-4					FSTA:2022-07-Jp9654
J		Amir Rezvankhah; Saeid Yarmand, M.; Babak Ghanbarzadeh; Homaira Mirzaee							Characterization of bioactive peptides produced from green lentil (Lens culinaris) seed protein concentrate using Alcalase and Flavourzyme in single and sequential hydrolysis.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to produce bioactive peptides with increased angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory and antioxidant activities from single and sequential hydrolysis, using Alcalase and Flavourzyme at the enzyme to substrate ratio of 2% and hydrolysis time of 180 min. Results indicated that sequential hydrolysis led to a higher degree of hydrolysis (DH) value (47.05%) compared with single hydrolysis (8.51% and 20.12%). Higher ACE-inhibitory activity and total phenol content were determined for the lentil protein hydrolysates (LPH) compared with lentil protein concentrate, and also higher antioxidant activity was obtained comparing with butylated hydroxytoluene as a synthetic antioxidant. The main amino acid profile of hydrolysates was maintained. The higher DH via hydrolysis was obtained, more small and medium molecular weight peptides were generated according to the gel permeation chromatography and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Hydrolysis did not have a significant effect on the denaturation point of protein, and thus the thermal stability was maintained. Shorter peaks were observed for hydrolysates by atomic force microscopy. Enzymatic hydrolysis increased the umami sensorial taste. Novelty impact statement. Using a combination of enzymes in sequential hydrolysis can produce bioactive peptides with improved ACE-inhibitory and antioxidant activities. Alcalase leads to the production of bitter taste peptides which can be altered by applying Flavourzyme to hydrolyze the former peptides to fewer bitter peptides. Lentil protein was hydrolyzed sequentially into bioactive peptides with improved anti-hypertensive and antioxidant activities and increment of umami taste in respect to the produced peptides with specific amino acid profiles. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15932					FSTA:2022-03-Jp2987

Effect of microbial lipase and transglutaminase on the textural, physicochemical, and microbial parameters of fresh quark cheese.		Journal of Dairy Science					In this study, the addition of microbial transglutaminase (MTG) and lipase in quark cheese samples was studied during storage (21 d). Four types of cheese were made using 3 different levels of MTG (T1, 0.1 g/L; T2, 0.2 g/L; T3, 0.3 g/L) and lipase (T1, 0.02 g/L; T2, 0.04 g/L; T3, 0.06 g/L), and one cheese was made without any treatment as a control sample. The physicochemical, textural, microbial, and sensory properties of cheese samples were monitored at 1, 7, 14, and 21 d of storage period. The results showed that the treated samples had higher proteolysis and lipolysis activities during storage than the control sample. The textural analysis indicated an insignificant increase in the hardness value of the enzyme-treated sample. Also, the sensory analysis exhibited that the treated samples had higher texture acceptability. The higher concentration of enzymes resulted in lower color, odor, taste, and overall acceptability, and higher microbial population. Finally, the addition of microbial MTG and lipase in preparation of quark cheese samples could be recommended for a short storage time.

J		Amirhossein Mohammadian; Mohsen Barzegar; Ahmad Mani-Varnosfaderani							Detection of fraud in lime juice using pattern recognition techniques and FT-IR spectroscopy.		Food Science & Nutrition					The lime juice is one of the products that has always fallen victim to fraud by manufacturers for reducing the cost of products. The aim of this research was to determine fraud in distributed lime juice products from different factories in Iran. In this study, 101 samples were collected from markets and also prepared manually and finally derived into 5 classes as follows: two natural classes (Citrus limetta, Citrus aurantifolia), including 17 samples, and three reconstructed classes, including 84 samples (made from Spanish concentrate, Chinese concentrate, and concentrate containing adulteration compounds). The lime juice samples were freeze-dried and analyzed using FT-IR spectroscopy. At first, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied for clustering, but the samples were not thoroughly clustered with respect to their original groups in score plots. To enhance the classification rates, different chemometric algorithms including variable importance in projection (VIP), partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and counter propagation artificial neural networks (CPANN) were used. The best discriminatory wavenumbers related to each class were selected using the VIP-PLS-DA algorithm. Then, the CPANN algorithm was used as a nonlinear mapping tool for classification of the samples based on their original groups. The lime juice samples were correctly designated to their original groups in CPANN maps and the overall accuracy of the model reached up to 0.96 and 0.87 for the training and validation procedures. This level of accuracy indicated the FT-IR spectroscopy coupled with VIP-PLS-DA and CPANN methods can be used successfully for detection of authenticity of lime juice samples. © 2021 The Authors.

The effect of Amygdalus scoparia Spach and Lepidium sativum L. seed gums on the properties of formulated food supplement for soldiers using Response Surface Methodology.		Food Science & Nutrition					Today, the lack of a proper nutritional formulation of the diet for soldiers is well felt. In this study, a newly formulated food supplement (FFS) was designed to supply all essential nutrients like protein, carbohydrate, oil, fat-soluble vitamins, and minerals, and Lepidium sativum L. Seed (shahi) gum and A mygdalus scoparia Spach (zedo) gum were applied to FFS to promote physicochemical and sensory properties of FFS. The samples were developed by preparing emulsion including meat powder (45.0 g/100 g), soybean powder (25.0 g/100 g), and plant oils (15.0 g/100 g). Iron, zinc, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) were also added to the formulation, and response surface methodology was used to optimize the effects of shahi and zedo gum at 0.5,1.0, and 2.0 g/100 g in FFS. The results showed that using hydrocolloids in appropriate amounts enhanced the sensory properties of FFS. Hydrocolloids protected the moisture content of FFS samples and also decreased the reduction of vitamins and minerals during 14 days of storage at 4 °C. The hydrocolloids improved the color indices and intrinsic viscosity of samples. The results of this study recommend the use of 1.26 g/100 g of shahi gum and 0.95 g/100 g of zedo gum to produce formulated food supplement for soldiers. This formulation supplies calories and provides some of the essential vitamins and food components to the body. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The production of sufficient animal feed in arid and semi-arid regions plays a significant role in food security in these areas. The present study was conducted based on the hypothesis that intercropping of sorghum and amaranth, comprising relatively drought tolerant forages, will enhance the yield and quality of the feed under limited irrigation water availability. Results. Implementation of fixed alternate furrow irrigation (FFI) and alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) resulted in a saving of 22.5% and 19.7% of irrigation water, respectively. However, the water saving declined both yield and quality of forage. In conventional furrow irrigation (CFI), the highest dry matter (DM) yield was 15.5 Mgha-1, obtained from S50-A50 treatment. In FFI and AFI, sole sorghum produced the highest DM. However, their maximum yields (11.2 and 12.6 Mgha-1, respectively) were not significantly different from yields in S75-A25 intercropping ratios. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was similar in CFI and AFI and considerably higher than FFI. Sorghum monoculture and the S75-A25 intercropping had the highest IWUE (3.4 and 3.3 kgm-3), whereas IWUE of the sole amaranth was 1.7 kgm-3. The partial land equivalent ratio and monetary advantage index of amaranth and sorghum indicated that sorghum would benefit from intercropping as long as its ratio in the intercropping is more than 25%. Conclusion. When sufficient irrigation is available, intercropping of sorghum and amaranth can considerably improve yield and quality of emergency feed. However, the benefits from intercropping faded under the two partial root-zone irrigation methods used in the present study. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	14	5918	5926	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11244					FSTA:2022-01-Ma0539
J		Amit Biswas; Damodhara R. Mailapalli; Narendra S. Raghuwanshi							Modelling the effect of changing transplanting date on consumptive water footprints for paddy under the system of rice intensification.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Consumptive water footprint (CWF) is a comprehensive measure of water consumption by paddy and can be used to assess the impact on freshwater volume. The seasonal water consumption and water footprints of paddy under any irrigation practice vary with changing the transplanting dates. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of shifting transplanting dates on CWFs of paddy under the system of rice intensification (SRI) using a crop model. A medium-duration variety (IR-36) was cultivated during kharif (monsoon) and rabi (non-monsoon) seasons of 2015/16 and 2016/17. The field data were used to calibrate and validate the crop model, Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM)-Oryza, as well as simulate paddy yield, evapotranspiration and consumptive water footprints (CWFs) under different transplanting dates. Results. The APSIM-Oryza simulated grain yield was found to be closely matched with the observed yield during both calibration (r2=0.98, root-mean-square error <300kgha-1) and validation (r2=0.88, root-mean-square error<400kgha-1). The seasonal water savings in SRI practice was 18-21% compared to conventional, with an effect of a 20-30% improvement in the yield. The early transplanting on 1 July in kharif and 15 December in rabi can produce maximum grain yields of 4.55 and 5.15tha-1, respectively, with a minimum CWF of 1064 and 855 m3 t-1 under SRI for the study region. Conclusion. The comparison of yield and CWF scenarios under different transplanting dates revealed the superiority of early transplanting in terms of yield improvement with the least irrigation requirement and CWF under SRI. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	13	5378	5390	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11186					FSTA:2021-12-Me7893

Food Chemistry					Here, we aimed to fabricate a label-free immunosensing platform for the first time based on molybdenum disulfide nanoparticles (nMoS2NPs) deposited on ITO) coated glass substrate for the electrochemical detection of ampicillin (AMP). The stable and high surface area of nMoS2NPs were made by a low-temperature one-step hydrothermal route, bestowing the carrying capacity of anti-AMP (antibody against AMP) through an amide linkage. The spectroscopic, morphological, and structural characterization of the proposed electrodes were performed using various analytical and electrochemical techniques. The differential pulse voltammetry technique was utilized to evaluate anti-AMP and AMP interaction on the electrode surface. The developed immunosensor exhibits high sensitivity, a broad detection range having a significant detection limit towards detection of AMP having excellent selectivity, acceptable stability, and reproducibility. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed immunosensor was tested in spiked milk, water, and orange juice, and the results confirmed the consistency of the immunosensor.

J		Amit Kumar; Rojalin Nayak; Ranjan Purohit, S.; Srinivasa Rao, P.							Impact of UV-C irradiation on solubility of Osborne protein fractions in wheat flour.		Food Hydrocolloids					Protein-protein and protein-starch interactions in the wheat flour decide its suitability for the baking process and can be modified by several physicochemical methods. The present study was undertaken to confirm the protein modification in wheat flour irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) radiation up to the maximum dose of 35 J/cm2/g of flour. Whole wheat (Triticum aestivum) flour samples of two varieties (Panjab var.: hard wheat and Sharbati var.: soft wheat) were irradiated with ultraviolet (UV-C, 254 nm) radiation of 12 and 36 W power for the exposure time up to 100 s. The solubility of the Osborne protein fractions and respective sulfhydryl group content were analyzed. The protein concentration, as well as sulfhydryl content in each fraction, changed significantly after irradiation. The varietal change in wheat flour and irradiation power both affected the viscometric response of irradiated samples. The viscosity of soft wheat flour decreased after mild treatment while increased after severe UV treatment indicating the oxido-reductive effect of ultraviolet radiation on wheat flour but it continuously increased with irradiation time for hard wheat flour. The SDS-PAGE technique was used to assess the changes in the primary chain of proteins, and FTIR analysis was conducted to confirm the conformational modification in proteins demonstrating the formation of beta-sheets and alpha-helices on the expense of random coils and beta-turns conformations after UV-C treatment. The findings confirmed that UV-C irradiation can alter the solubility and conformations of proteins unveiling the potential of UV-C radiation for flour modification.

Marechal): phytochemical profiling, bioactive compounds and in vitro pharmacological studies.		Food Bioscience					Key source of plant dietary proteins in humans are legume seeds. Moth bean (Vigna aconitifolia) seeds constitute one of these however, in comparison to other major legume crops, still remains underutilized. Herein, comprehensive biochemical profiling is attempted in 60 moth bean accessions belonging to diverse geographical regions of India. The study addressed phytochemical (sugar, starch, protein, amino acids, minerals, tannins, phytic acids and lectin) and pharmacological attributes (antioxidant and alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, ACE-I inhibition activity). UPLC-PDA revealed thirteen different phenolic acids, of these, catechin (987.37 mug/g dw), tannic acid (423.45 mug/g dw) and gallic acid (300.68 mug/g dw) were dominating. Derivatives of major flavonoids corroborated antihyperglycemic and antihypertensive bioactivities and revealed positive association with alpha-glucosidase and ACE-I inhibition. Some accession presents quantitatively higher contents of magnesium and iron thus utilisable as nutraceuticals. This maiden study identified bioactive compounds in some of the moth bean accessions viz. IC-36361, IC-311448, IC-415152, CAZRI and RMO-257 that endorse health properties.

J		Amjad M. Shraim; Talaat A. Ahmed; Mizanur Rahman, M.; Yousef M. Hijji							Determination of total flavonoid content by aluminum chloride assay: a critical evaluation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Flavonoids are important natural bioactive compounds. Quantitation of total flavonoid content (TFC) is widely performed using the aluminum chloride colorimetric assay against a flavonoid standard assuming equal responses from all flavonoids. The aim of this work was to critically evaluate the assay employing spike recovery in plant extracts and three authentic flavonoid standards (catechin, quercetin, and rutin). Due to the inherent variations in absorbance values at quantitation wavelengths between investigated flavonoids, the assay produced huge unacceptable differences in TFC. For trials involving AlCl3 alone in standard solutions, false-positive results were obtained (63-124%) when quercetin content was expressed as rutin equivalents. Conversely, false-negative results were found (26-42%) when rutin concentration was expressed as quercetin equivalents. Similarly, unacceptable spike recoveries were recorded (8-106%) when involving AlCl3 alone in standard solutions at all investigated wavelengths. For plant extracts, unacceptable differences (58-152%) in TFC were also obtained when either quercetin or rutin was used as a quantitation standard. When AlCl3 is used in conjunction with sodium nitrite, unacceptable high or low recoveries were noted depending on the quantitation standard used. The findings of this work provide conclusive evidence highlighting conceptual and methodological flaws in the AlCl3 colorimetric assay for the determination of TFC.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this article, we propose a measurement prototype based on an electronic nose device to discriminate the treated mint from the untreated mint with pesticides and to identify the day of treatment. The process consists of a sample of mint, two types of pesticides (Decis Fluxx and Malyphos 50), an electronic nose composed of a network of metal oxide sensors, a data card acquisition, a personal computer and a data analysis and processing method. The method used is a hybrid method combining the principal component analysis method with the support vector machines method and allowed us to have success rates of 100%, 87.50% and 75% successively for discrimination in the following cases: untreated and treated mint by Decis, untreated and treated mint by Malyphos and untreated and treated mint with both products. For the identification of the treatment day, we obtained success rates of around 87.50% and 100% respectively for the case of the Decis product and the Malyphos product. These results show that our proposal is quick, easy to use and inexpensive for the detection of the treated mint as well as the day of its treatment. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Optimization of gluten-free sponge cake fortified with whey protein concentrate using mixture design methodology.		Food Chemistry					This study aimed to optimize mixtures of whey protein concentrate (WPC) and two flours of rice and maize flours for the production of gluten-free sponge cakes. This was obtained by using mixture design methodology. WPC incorporation had positive effects on specific volume and baking loss of cakes, whilst, their incorporation increased their hardness. Considering all cakes properties, two formulas F1 (78.5% Maize, 15% Rice and 6.5% WPC) and F2 (82.4% Maize, 12% Rice and 5.6% WPC) were optimized using a mixture design. The microstructure F1 was more organized and very well structured with smaller aggregates. According to the organoleptic evaluation, F1 was also most appreciated by the tasting panel. The findings of the present study indicated that maize and rice flours, and WPC could be used as a substitute for wheat flour in producing sponge cakes of high quality.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF) on the cell disintegration index (Zp), the freeze-drying process and the final product quality of red beet and pineapple tissue was studied. Red beets and pineapples were PEF-treated at an electric field strength of 1.07 kV/cm and specific energy inputs of 1 kJ/kg and 4 kJ/kg (PEF1 and PEF2, respectively). Freeze-drying was performed at a pressure of 1 mbar and heating plate temperature of 50 °C for red beet and 40 °C for pineapple. The quality of freeze-dried tissue was evaluated by the analysis of residual moisture content, macrostructure, texture, colour and rehydration properties. For freeze-dried red beets, the betalain content from extracts was studied. It could be stated that PEF pre-treatment had no significant influence on drying time reduction, however significantly improved the final quality of freeze-dried product. Moreover, the effect of PEF was strongly depending on type of plant material used. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Amolegbe, K. B.; Upton, J.; Bageant, E.; Blom, S.							Food price volatility and household food security: evidence from Nigeria.		Food Policy					Food prices vary seasonally, particularly in areas with rainfed agricultural production and imperfect markets, and are also subject to volatility arising from macroeconomic and climatic shocks, such as global supply shocks and abrupt policy changes. The specific nature of these relationships remains a pressing empirical question, particularly in contexts where food insecurity is prevalent, prices are subject to diverse sources of variation, and governments are seeking policy options to reduce price volatility. We use panel data from Nigeria to investigate the effects of non-seasonal food price volatility, in particular unexpected increases in prices, on household food security. Accounting for substitution effects and focusing on both domestic and imported rice-key components of the Nigerian diet-we find that imported rice price increases are damaging to both dietary diversity (downward impact) and the food share of consumption expenditure (upward impact), while impacts of domestic rice price volatility are ambiguous. We find differential effects by wealth status that vary across indicators of food security: an increase in the price of imported rice increases food share more among poor households than rich households, and decreases dietary diversity more among rich households than poor households. Our findings point toward the importance of improving food security by mitigating the effects of global shocks on imported food prices, and also highlight the data challenges and complexity involved in developing precise answers to these important policy questions.

Basil essential oil: composition, antimicrobial properties, and microencapsulation to produce active chitosan films for food packaging.		Foods					The essential oil (EO) from basil-Ocimum basilicum-was characterized, microencapsulated by vibration technology, and used to prepare a new type of packaging system designed to extend the food shelf life. The basil essential oil (BEO) chemical composition and antimicrobial activity were analyzed, as well as the morphological and biological properties of the derived BEO microcapsules (BEOMC). Analysis of BEO by gas chromatography demonstrated that the main component was linalool, whereas the study of its antimicrobial activity showed a significant inhibitory effect against all the microorganisms tested, mostly Gram-positive bacteria. Moreover, the prepared BEOMC showed a spheroidal shape and retained the EO antimicrobial activity. Finally, chitosan-based edible films were produced, grafted with BEOMC, and characterized for their physicochemical and biological properties. Since their effective antimicrobial activity was demonstrated, these films were tested as packaging system by wrapping cooked ham samples during 10 days of storage, with the aim of their possible use to extend the shelf life of the product. It was demonstrated that the obtained active film can both control the bacterial growth of the cooked ham and markedly inhibit the pH increase of the packaged food. © 2021 by the authors.

B.; Bella, G. di							Tunisian essential oils as potential food antimicrobials and antioxidants and screening of their element profile.		European Food Research and Technology					The potential employment of 18 commercial Tunisian essential oils (EOs) as natural food preservatives was investigated. Their antimicrobial activity was evaluated against two food-borne bacteria (Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Klebsiella pneumoniae) by the agar-well diffusion method and, subsequently, by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC); while their antioxidant activity was assayed by the DPPH test. Also, the main volatile constituents and inorganic elements were elucidated and discussed in relation to the biological activities. Excluding the wormwood EO, all EOs inhibited the growth of at least one reference strain. In particular, spearmint, sage and rosemary EOs had the lowest MICs against E. coli O157:H7 (0.09, 0.09, 0.07 mg mL-1, respectively); whereas sage EO was effective against K. pneumoniae at 0.41 mg mL-1. All EOs displayed also a promising antioxidant activity. Specifically, spearmint, bigroot geranium, and sage EOs showed the lowest IC50 values (0.024, 0.046 and 0.052 mg mL-1), and a behavior similar to that of butylated hydroxytoluene. EOs exhibited variegated and peculiar element profiles. Among minerals, Mg and K were in the range 1.72-14.12 mg Kg-1 and 0.57-20.90 mg Kg-1; while Cu and Fe were generally the most abundant trace essential metals (0.07-1.02 mg Kg-1 0.20-2.98 mg Kg-1, respectively). Very low and safe levels of heavy metals were also revealed. A statistical correlation analysis pointed out a significant positive correlation between some elements (K, Cu, and Fe) and the biological activities displayed. In conclusion, the selected Tunisian EOs had a marked potential applicability as antibacterial and antioxidant additive in food industry. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

To what extent do environmental or technological conditions affect the sensory differentiation of raw ewe milk cheeses produced in valley or mountain farms?		Journal of Dairy Science					This work discusses the extent to which differences in technological or environmental conditions affect the sensory properties of cheeses made in mountain or valley farms. The work is focused on Idiazabal cheese, frequently made with lamb rennet paste and with milk from sheep flocks managed under extensive grazing systems. Fourteen sensory attributes were assessed, and free fatty acid content and rennet lipase activity were analyzed in cheeses from mountain and valley farms. Sensory differences between cheeses were mainly dependent on the type and amount of rennet used for cheesemaking, particularly on the level of rennet lipase activity. The sensory attributes did not appear to be influenced by pasture type, grazing practices, or environmental conditions associated with farm location. Rennet lipase activity was responsible for the high scores of strong sensory attributes such as pungent mouthfeel, and these attributes masked the potential sensory differences that could be found due to farm location.

J		Amores-Arrocha, A.; Sancho-Galan, P.; Jimenez-Cantizano, A.; Palacios, V.							A comparative study on volatile compounds and sensory profile of white and red wines elaborated using bee pollen versus commercial activators.		Foods					Lack of nutrients in grape may cause problems for a proper alcoholic fermentation process, resulting in an altered aromatic profile of the wines. To avoid this situation, commercial winemakers often use fermentation activators, which are usually combinations of ammonium salts, inactivated yeast and thiamine. In addition, it has been shown that bee pollen addition to the grape can help to improve fermentation, resulting in better volatile compound profile of wines responsible for sensory quality. For this reason, the aim of this research work was to carry out a comparative study using bee pollen versus commercial fermentation activators in white and red winemaking. The same dose of bee pollen and commercial activators (0.25 g/L) were used in all experiments. Volatile compounds were analyzed by gas chromatographymass spectrometry, odor activity values were determined to assess odorant impact of various volatile compound families, and finally a descriptive sensory analysis was carried out. Then, the triangular test and the ranking assay were used to identify perceptible differences as well as preference among the wines elaborated. Compared to commercial activators, bee pollen wines increased volatile compound formation, mainly higher alcohols, esters, and terpenes, enhancing fruity and floral odorant series. On the other hand, triangular test showed significant differences between wines, and the ranking assay showed a greater preference for bee pollen wines. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Amoriello, T.; Mellara, F.; Amoriello, M.; Ceccarelli, D.; Ciccoritti, R.							Powdered seaweeds as a valuable ingredient for functional breads.		European Food Research and Technology					Seaweeds are considered a promising ingredient to use in developing novel food products, due to their nutritional composition and richness in bioactive compounds. The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of four seaweeds (Chlorella vulgaris CH, Laminaria ochroleuca KO, Ulva spp. SL, Arthrospira platensis SP) enrichment (1%, 2.5%, 4%, flour basis) on technological performance and nutraceutical prospective of soft wheat bread. To do this, dough rheological properties measured by means of farinograph and consistograph parameters, baking response (loaf volume, colour, and porosity), and nutraceutical potential of bread (total soluble phenolic compounds, pigments, and antioxidant activity) were evaluated. Algae addition significantly decreased water absorption and development time, except to SL, and increased stability up to 2.5%, and tenacity for KO. In terms of bread properties, the specific volume was positively affected by SP addition, while negatively by KO enrichment; the porosity enhanced especially for SP and CH. Then, bread crumbs and crusts showed a darker and greener colour, especially for green algae. All seaweeds enriched breads showed significant higher phenolic compounds, chlorophylls a and b, and yellow pigment. At last, SP, SL, and CH at 4% level pointed out the highest antioxidant capacity. Our results suggested that the four algal biomasses could be a suitable ingredient in bread making, also in a perspective of a healthier and sustainable diet. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Designing a functional rice muffin formulated with prebiotic oligosaccharides and sugar reduction.		Food Bioscience					Innovation of pastry products towards higher nutritional and commercial value remains a challenge to the growing field of healthy food. In this study, the prebiotic supplementation and sugar reduction were explored in a widely consumed pastry product with a low level of innovation. The prebiotic potential of commercial agave inulin and galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) was evaluated and compared by an in vitro model using human fecal inocula. Rice muffins containing 100% of sugar or 75% of sugar supplemented with 0.8% GOS were produced and compared with commercial rice muffins regarding their physical and textural properties. GOS fermentation led to the highest production of lactate and short-chain fatty acids, besides the most significant reduction of the final pH value and of the ammonia and methane production. Inulin presented a higher selectivity towards Lactobacillaceae (511% of all), while GOS are more efficient to stimulate Bifidobacteriaceae growth (657% of all). Both prebiotics were effective in reducing Methanobacteria. The reduction of sugar content modified the air bubbles characteristics (size and population with a greater number of tunnels) present in the muffin crumb, without relevant differences in apparent porosity. Textural results indicated that springiness and resilience of the muffin with low sugar content are acceptable, but hardness and chewiness were increased. The new-formula muffins presented very relevant textural parameters with comparable values to those reported in the literature for the commercial ones, thus anticipating a good consumer acceptance. This study is an important contribution towards more innovative and diversified healthy pastry products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Amorim, T. L.; Oliveira, M. A. L. de							A capillary electrophoresis approach for major unsaturated fatty acids screening in milk.		International Dairy Journal					Fast methods for milk analysis are internationally desired, and, in this study, a new method for milk unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) is proposed, using capillary zone electrophoresis with direct detection in the ultraviolet region. Run time analysis was 4 min, and sample preparation comprised only a saponification reaction, which indicates the suitability of the method for UFA monitoring in routine analyses by industries and milk researchers. Milk powder samples submitted to different oxygen content (0.3-20.4%) were analysed after ten months of storage to demonstrate method applicability, aiming to evaluate differences in UFA profiles, the most prone to lipid oxidation. No significant difference was noticed within the 95% confidence interval when comparing different samples. Limits of detection (mmol L-1) for UFAs were 0.040 (C18:1 n-9 cis); 0.014 (C18:2 n-6) and 0.010 (C18:3 n-3). Limits of quantification were 0.132, 0.046, and 0.034 mmol L-1, respectively.

Lipid classification of fish oil omega-3 supplements by 1H NMR and multivariate analysis.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The worldwide advent of concentrated supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids (FA) in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG) or ethyl esters (EE) has increased the interest in developing methods to classify these products. The quality control based on their lipid composition has become necessary since EE bioavailability has been proved to be lower when compared to the TAG. In this preliminary study, eight models based on 1H NMR and supervised discriminant analysis (PLS-DA/OPLS-DA) were applied to classify omega-3 fish oil in TAG or EE forms. The 4.0-4.5 ppm region was selected for modeling since it bracketed spectral features to discriminate TAG and EE. The non-supervised principal component analysis was employed to visually evaluate the distribution of samples and revealed a clear separation of TAG from EE marine oils along PC1. In addition, representative TAG and EE samples were 100% correctly classified using any of the eight supervised models studied. The developed models resulted in high R2Y (≥ 0.977) and Q2 (≥ 0.953), and low root mean square error for prediction (≤ 0.009), which demonstrates the high potential of this rapid and straightforward procedure to evaluate the lipid form of supplements and mislabeling.

Dietary fibre intake is associated with serum levels of uraemic toxins in children with chronic kidney disease.		Toxins					Imbalanced colonic microbial metabolism plays a pivotal role in generating protein-bound uraemic toxins (PBUTs), which accumulate with deteriorating kidney function and contribute to the uraemic burden of children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dietary choices impact the gut microbiome and metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between dietary fibre and gut-derived PBUTs in paediatric CKD. Sixty-one (44 male) CKD children (95 years) were prospectively followed for two years. Dietary fibre intake was evaluated by either 24-h recalls (73%) or 3-day food records (27%) at the same time of blood sampling for assessment of total and free serum levels of different PBUTs using liquid chromatography. We used linear mixed models to assess associations between fibre intake and PBUT levels. We found an inverse association between increase in fibre consumption (g/day) and serum concentrations of free indoxyl sulfate (-3.1% (-5.9%; -0.3%) (p=0.035)), free p-cresyl sulfate (-2.5% (-4.7%; -0.3%) (p=0.034)), total indole acetic acid (IAA) (-1.6% (-3.0%; -0.3%) (p=0.020)), free IAA (-6.6% (-9.3%; -3.7%) (p< 0.001)), total serum p-cresyl glucuronide (pCG) (-3.0% (-5.6%; -0.5%) (p=0.021)) and free pCG levels (-3.3% (-5.8%; -0.8%) (p=0.010)). The observed associations between dietary fibre intake and the investigated PBUTs highlight potential benefits of fibre intake for the paediatric CKD population. The present observational findings should inform and guide adaptations of dietary prescriptions in children with CKD. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					Yam is one of the commonly consumed carbohydrate staples. The objective of this work was to investigate the effect of boiling, roasting, and frying on the glycemic index (GI) of white yam (Dioscorea rotundata), yellow yam (Dioscorea cayenesis), and water yam (Dioscorea alata). Yam tubers were obtained (peeled, sliced, washed) deep fried in vegetable oil for 35-40 min and boiled in water for about 35-45 min. Sliced unpeeled tubers were also roasted at about 120 °C for 40-45 min. The cooked yam samples were fed to 10 healthy subjects aged between 20-50 years. A glucometer was used to measure the blood glucose concentrations of the test individuals before consuming the yam diets and after the 15th, 30th, 45th, 60th, 90th, and 120th min of consumption. The average incremental area under the curves (IAUC) obtained from the recorded blood glucose concentrations were used to calculate the GI of various yam diets. The GI of the yam diets were found to be in the following increasing order: White-yam-boiled (44.26%) < Water-yam-boiled (50.12%) < White-yam-roasted (50.62%) < Water-yam-roasted (54.04%) < White-yam-fried (59.13%) < Yellow-yam-fried (65.08%) < Water-yam-fried (69.16%) < Yellow-yam-roasted (70.62%) < Yellow-yam-boiled (75.18%). White yam diets relatively had lower GI compared to yellow yam and water yam. Boiling was found to give generally lower GI in the white and water yams and could therefore be applied in the preparation of lower GI diets for diabetics. © 2020 The Authors.

Phenolic compounds from an Algerian medicinal plant (Pallenis spinosa): simulated gastrointestinal digestion, characterization, and biological and enzymatic activities.		Food & Function					Pallenis spinosa is a medicinal plant which is used in folk medicine as curative or preventive remedies for various diseases. Individual phenolic compounds from the methanolic extracts of its flowers, leaves and stem were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography method (HPLC) and total phenolic contents (TPC) were evaluated by Folin-Ciocalteu assay. The stability and bioactivity (antioxidant activity, micellar cholesterol solubility, alpha-amylase, and angiotensin converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitory effects) of these extracts in the gastrointestinal environment was determined before and after their protection in hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) capsules. HPLC analysis revealed the presence of thirteen phenolic compounds with nine flavonoids and four phenolic acids. Except for kaempferol, the twelve other compounds have not been previously detected in the aerial part of the studied plant. Quantification of phenolics by HPLC and Folin Ciocalteu methods revealed that the highest TPC was detected in the flower extracts (104.310.80 and 145.730.48 mg EGA per g of extract, respectively). Leaf extracts displayed the best antioxidant capacity against the two tested radicals DPPH and ABTS (IC50=1.240.03 and 0.940.02 mg mL-1, respectively), FRAP assay (IC50=0.500.02 mg mL-1), alpha-amylase inhibitory (IC50=1.250.00 mg mL-1) and angiotensin activity with an inhibitory percent of 30.100.12%. The best activity shown by stem extracts was against micellar cholesterol solubility (67.570.00%). A strong decrease in TPC and their bioactivity was observed after the gastrointestinal digestion (GID) in non encapsulated extracts. These results showed that P. spinosa is a good source of phenolic compounds and GID affects significantly their composition, content and bioactivity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Food Microbiology					The effect of heat against eleven Salmonella strains in model meat juices was examined. Juices from beef, lamb and goat were made from either the fatty layer (FL), muscle (M) or a mixture of both (FLM). The pH of each FLM sample was altered to match the pH of PBS and vice versa to determine the pH effect on the survival of Salmonella against the effect of heat. Salmonella were exposed to either gradual heating to 70°C in FLM, M and FL or heat shock at 70 °C for 5 min in FLM. Fat, fatty acid profile and iron content of the juices were determined. Gradual heat treatment significantly (p≤0.05) reduced Salmonella as compared to the untreated controls (~1.92-7.61 log CFU ml-1) while heat shock significantly (p≤0.05) reduced Salmonella as compared to the untreated controls (~5.80-7.36 log CFU ml-1). Survival of Salmonella was higher in lamb juices than other juices. The fat content in lamb FL (3.25%) was significantly higher (p≤0.05) than beef (1.30%) and goat FL (1.42%). Iron content in lamb FLM (~127mg/kg-1) was significantly (p≤0.05) lower than beef (~233mg/kg-1) and goat FLM (~210mg/kg-1). The omega 6 and linoleic acid content in goat FLM (~36.0% and ~34.4%) was significantly higher (p≤0.05) than beef (~29.1% and ~27.1%). Fat, fatty acids and iron may differentially protect Salmonella against the effect of heat in these juices.

J		Amrita Ray; Aashitosh A. Inamdar; Suresh D. Sakhare; Kumar Srivastava, A.							Development of physical process for quinoa fractionation and targeted separation of germ with physical, chemical and SEM studies.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Dry milling process is developed, which is scalable to industrial capacity and more eco-friendly compared to wet method for separation of germ, perisperm and bran fractions from quinoa as potential functional food ingredients. Peripheral germ is the most important functional component of grain as it stores most of the protein and fat reserve. Fractionation of the grain is performed at different conditioning moisture (viz., 12, 14, 16, 18 & 20%). Medium conditioning moisture (14-16%) has shown optimum balance between yield and quality of the fractions; and has been explored further to develop a novel process specifically targeted for germ separation by making significant changes in the flow diagram of the roller milling process. This developed process enables separation of germ with recovery of 82.57% of protein, 80.04% fat and 81.20% of minerals with respect to germ extracted manually. Bran obtained by the developed novel process shows double the amount of dietary fibre compared to quinoa seed; perisperm having <1% mineral content with brightness in colour portrays purity of the fraction. Isolated fraction of quinoa germ has high content of protein, ash and fat. Separated fractions with higher nutritional value have numerous functional applications in food industry.

J		Amrita Saha; Guariso, D.; Mbuya, M. N. N.; Ebata, A.							Firm's compliance behaviour towards food fortification regulations: evidence from oil and salt producers in Bangladesh.		Food Policy					Impact of national food fortification programs is contingent on the extent to which there is compliance with national standards. However, this compliance is often sub-optimal and is not consistently measured. One of the challenges to more regular measurement is an over-reliance on quantitative assessments of micronutrient levels for compliance, which are costly. In resource constrained environments, this contributes to weaknesses in regulatory monitoring. We offer an alternative, systems-based approach to determine compliance, presenting a unique score that can capture firms' compliance behaviour, based on whether and how firms actually carry out stages of the fortification process. The key utility of such a measure being its use to monitor fortification propensity and assess changes in response to interventions. Further, we present an empirical application of this measure, providing novel evidence on firms' compliance towards food fortification regulations in Bangladesh, investigating the institutional and firm-level factors that correlate with compliance behaviour towards food fortification regulations among edible oil and salt producers.

J		Amritpal Kaur; Balwinder Singh; Madhav P. Yadav; Seerat Bhinder; Narpinder Singh							Isolation of arabinoxylan and cellulose-rich arabinoxylan from wheat bran of different varieties and their functionalities.		Food Hydrocolloids					The study evaluated the yield, emulsifying, antioxidant properties, protein content and amino acid composition of water-extractable (WE) and alkali-extractable (AE) Hemi-B and the water holding capacity and protein content of cellulose-rich arabinoxylan (CAX) fractions isolated from the bran of four wheat varieties. It was observed that CAX from the variety C-306 possessed the lowest protein content (3.83%) and the highest water holding capacity (16.13%). Total phenolic content of AE-Hemi-B and WE-Hemi-B fractions varied from 4.54 to 7.47 mg ferulic acid equivalents (FAE) /g and 3.51-4.91 mg FAE/g, respectively. Except for the AE-Hemi-B fraction of HS-490, bound phenolic content was higher than free phenolic content. AE-Hemi-B had exceptionally higher bound phenolic and antioxidant content. FTIR bands at 1364 cm-1, 1028 cm-1 and 849 cm-1 confirmed the presence of a highly branched arabinoxylan structure. The presence of phenolic ring structure, characteristic of ferulic acid, was confirmed by the band signal at 1520 cm-1. The emulsion stability of WE-Hemi-B decreased drastically, after storage at accelerated temperature (60 °C). However, all AE-Hemi-B yielded good emulsions, expect HD-2967 variety, which exhibited the poorest emulsion stability, while, C-306 yielded exceptionally stable emulsion, better than well-known corn fiber gum, up to 3 days under accelerated storage.

Food Control					The authenticity of the geographical origin of peach is crucial because of the increased awareness of consumers on the high quality and safety of foodstuff. This study was conducted to discriminate 150 peach samples from six regions in China by using stable isotope data coupled with multielement analysis. The ratios of three types of stable isotopes (delta13C, delta2H and delta18O) and the contents of 18 elements were employed to develop classification models that could trace the geographical origin of peach samples. Results of principal component analysis can distinguish the samples cultivated from coastal and inland regions, mainly attributed to H and O isotope ratios. Furthermore, stepwise linear discriminant analysis and orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis provided a clear discrimination of the peach samples from different regions. The major important variables responsible for the differentiation in these models were delta2H, delta13C, Na, Cd, V, Al, delta18O, Be, K, Co, Cu and Ag. The findings also helped elucidate the variations in the isotope ratios of peach in terms of geographical origins. On the basis of stable isotope combined with multielement analysis, this study offered an effective tool of geographical classification for the control of fraudulent geographical labeling of peaches traded in fruit markets.

Food & Function					Diets of overloaded purine-rich foods for a long time are one of the important reasons to cause renal lesions. Eucommia ulmoides is one of the traditional Chinese medicine herbs, which has been used to recover functions of the kidney. However, its mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the effects and protective mechanism of Eucommia ulmoides extract on renal injury caused by long-term high purine diets in rats. SD rats underwent an intragastric adenine (200 mg kg-1 d-1) administration for 9 weeks and were treated for 15 weeks. The results demonstrated that Eucommia ulmoides extract significantly reduced serum Cre and BUN levels in rats. H & E and Masson's trichrome stains showed notable lowering of the infiltration of inflammatory cells, the formation of fibrous tissues and collagen fibers, and improvement in the pathological morphology of kidneys. It also suppressed the protein and mRNA expressions of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA and enhanced E-cadherin expression. Meanwhile, Eucommia ulmoides extract prominently inhibited the mRNA expression of Col I, Col III, Col IV, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 and promoted expressions of MMP-1, MMP-2 and MMP-9. Through our study, it is the first time to prove that Eucommia ulmoides extract could ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis and may involve in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation enzyme (MMPs/TIMPs) system, promotion of the expression of E-cadherin, and suppression of expressions of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA. The results provide a significant implication for the utilization of Eunomia Ulmoides extract as functional foods to enhance renal functions and improve renal injury caused by high purine diets. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	12	5607	5620	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02802a					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14458
J		An Liu; Ling Lin; Wei Xu; Zhihua Gong; Zhonghua Liu; Wenjun Xiao							L-Theanine regulates glutamine metabolism and immune function by binding to cannabinoid receptor 1.		Food & Function					L-Theanine is a characteristic amino acid in tea with various effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Previously, most studies had reported that L-theanine regulates the immune function in vivo by inhibiting the expression of the inflammatory factors, but how L-theanine regulates the inflammatory factors' pathway is not known. In this study, we innovatively found the binding target of L-theanine in vivo-cannabinoid receptor 1, and demonstrated that L-theanine regulated the immune function and glutamine metabolism by competitively binding cannabinoid receptor 1. Mechanistically, L-theanine competitively binds cannabinoid receptor 1, leading to inhibition of cannabinoid receptor 1 activity, and regulates glutamine metabolism and immune function in normal and E44813-stressed rats. In normal rats, L-theanine inhibits ERK1/2 phosphorylation through Gbetay by antagonizing cannabinoid receptor 1, thus affecting GS expression. From the point of view of immune signaling, after LTA antagonizes the activity of cannabinoid receptor 1, it relieves the inhibition of cannabinoid receptor 1 on COX-2 expression, downregulates Pdcd4 expression and NFkappaB, and ultimately enhances the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10. In E44813-stressed rats, L-theanine promotes the nuclear translocation of p-ERK1/2 by inhibiting the activity of cannabinoid receptor 1, and finally acts on GS. At the same time, it decreases the expression of the pro-inflammatory factor TNF-alpha and increases the expression of the anti-inflammatory factor IL-10 in stressed rats through the COX2-Pdcd4-NFkappaB-IL10 and TNFalpha pathways. In summary, these results demonstrate that L-theanine regulates glutamine metabolism and immune function by competitively binding to cannabinoid receptor 1. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	13	5755	5769	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00505g					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14960

Food Hydrocolloids					It is of great significance that lactic acid bacteria reach the intestinal tract successfully with the assistance of protective carriers. In this paper, novel pH-sensitive hydrogels based on whey protein isolate (WPI) grafted sodium tripolyphosphate (STP) due to their non toxicity and biodegradability, were synthesized and utilized as new carrier for specific pH-sensitive controlled Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) release. Evidences of STP grafting were extracted from FTIR, while the morphological structure of modified protein hydrogel was investigated by scanning electron microscopy. Factors affecting on the pH responsiveness and gel hardness were studied. The protection of L. plantarum in simulated gastric juice was evaluated as a function of STP addition and protein concentration. The swelling behavior of the modified WPI gel showed sensitivity to environmental pH as the amount of STP added was 9%, which shrunk in acidic system and stretched in alkaline environment. The modified WPI (9% STP, 5% protein) gel had the strongest protective effect on L. plantarum, and the survival rate of the strain increased by 6.41 log after being soaked in acidic environment (pH 2.0) for 30 min compared with control. Accordingly, grafting of STP has controlled release profile behavior. The preliminary results clearly suggested that the WPI-STP hydrogel may be a potential candidate for intestinal specific release of active substances.

Utilization of wheat germ oil and wheat bran fiber as fat replacer for the development of low-fat beef patties.		Food Science & Nutrition					The present study was aimed to evaluate the effects of wheat germ oil and wheat bran fiber as fat replacers on quality and stability of low-fat beef patties. Total five treatments were prepared by employing wheat germ oil (WGO) and wheat bran fiber (WBF). WBF was used at fixed amount of 3% in all treatments except control in conjunction with varying WGO concentrations as follows: 1.5%, 3%, and 4.5%. Prepared raw and cooked beef patties were stored at 4 °C, and further analyses were carried out up to 21 days of storage period with intermittent evaluation interval of 7 days. Higher values of TBARS, peroxide, and cholesterol were observed in raw and cooked beef patties in control, whereas minimum values were found in treatment of beef patties prepared with WGO 4.5%+ WBF 3%. The physicochemical parameters were observed by pH and hunter color values. PH was higher in cooked patties as compared to beef patties and showed increases with increase in WGO concentration and storage intervals. The sensorial attributes were observed which included different parameters, such as appearance, texture, taste, odor, and overall acceptability. Higher score was given by the panelists to control for both raw and cooked beef patties; however, minimum score for all sensory properties was found in group treated with WGO 4.5%+ WBF 3% within acceptable limit. In nutshell, raw and cooked beef patties treated with WGO 4.5% plus WBF 3% showed better quality, stability, and reduced cholesterol content. © 2021 The Authors.

Evaluating the therapeutic potential of white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) against DMBA-induced breast cancer in Sprague Dawley rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The current research work was designed to investigate the protective effects of white button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus) against 7,12-dimethylbenz [a] anthracene (DMBA)-induced breast cancer. Breast cancer was induced in rats by the administration of a single dose of 50 mg/kg DMBA via gavage. The rats were divided into four groups: G1 (negative control group), G2 (positive control group), G3 (rats receiving mushroom extract), and G4 (rats administered with doxorubicin). The mushroom extract significantly (p<.001) improved the activity of antioxidant enzymes in carcinogenic rats. Moreover, the mushroom extract also prevented the increase in the concentration of tumor biomarkers that are CEA, CA 15.3, and CRP in experimental rats. Liver function enzymes were also raised in G2 and G4 compared with G3. Besides, the RBCs and Hb were also reduced significantly in G4 while in G3. The mushroom extract effectively controlled the level of RBCs and Hb. An improvement in lipid profile was also measured in mushroom extract receiving rats. Conclusively, the mushroom extract alleviated DMBA-induced breast cancer potentially via improving antioxidants, reducing lipid peroxidation, and decreasing tumor biomarkers. Practical applications. The present research study examined the antitumor potential of white button mushroom. The mushroom effectively prevented the increase in tumor biomarkers, reduction in antioxidant enzymes, and increase in lipid peroxidation in rats with DMBA-induced breast cancer. The mushroom can be used as a potential source to prevent breast cancer and further research can be conducted to explore its anticancer mechanisms. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13979					FSTA:2022-04-Jq4268

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Penicillium digitatum and Penicillium italicum are potentially important post-harvest pathogens of citrus fruit causing huge economic loss. In this study salicylic acid (SA) and Cinnamomum verum were tested to control the infection of P. digitatum (green mold) and P. italicum (blue mold) as an alternative to chemical control. In an in vitro assay methanolic extracts of five plants were tested for antifungal activity where C. verum exhibited the highest colony growth inhibition 74.6 and 76.4% of green and blue mold respectively. Moreover, during In Planta assay the combination of C. verum and SA produced the lowest disease incidence (20 and 33.3%) and severity (13.1 and 6.1%) of green and blue mold respectively compared to stand-alone treatments without affecting the fruit quality considerably. Furthermore, an upsurge in the the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), and phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) encoding genes of citrus fruit was recorded during transcriptional profiling. The highest gene expression was recorded in fruit treated with C. verum and SA in combination compared to healthy control. Similar results were observed during quantification of corresponding gene products. This unveils the fact that the enhanced expression of defense-linked genes might be associated with the disease suppression. Conclusively, our findings indicate that C. verum and SA in combination can suppress green and blue mold of Citrus by modulating the expression of defense-linked genes. The combined use of plant extracts and resistance inducers is a safer alternate to chemicals to suppress green and blue mold during storage.

J		Anamika Sharma; Vijay Tirpude, N.; Monika Kumari; Yogendra Padwad							Rutin prevents inflammation-associated colon damage via inhibiting the p38/MAPKAPK2 and PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/NF-kappaB signalling axes and enhancing splenic Tregs in DSS-induced murine chronic colitis.		Food & Function					A large body of emerging evidence has revealed the role of p38/MK2 and PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta cascades in the orchestrating process of colitis. Rutin, a bioflavonoid present in many fruits and vegetables, has been recognized to offer therapeutic attributes in acute colitis. However, its role in chronic colitic condition has not yet been delineated in reference to p38/MK2 and PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta signalling. The present investigation assessed the efficacy and underlying molecular mechanism of rutin in alleviating DSS-induced chronic colitis. The analysis of signalling pathways demonstrated the robust activation of PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/MAPKs/NF-kappaB and p38/MK2 in DSS-induced colitis in animals, which was efficiently alleviated following the rutin treatment. In silico studies indicated its target specificity with these pathways. Rutin administration markedly improved the disease activity score, colon length, goblet cell loss and compromised colon epithelial integrity in colitic mice. Decreased expression of oxi-inflammatory markers such as IgM, IgE, iNOS, ICAM-1, HO-1 and Th1/IL-10 cytokines ratios after treatment suggests its efficacy in regulating effector, regulatory and B cell homeostasis. Additionally, rutin demonstrated its role in restoring epithelial integrity by modulating the transcript levels of tight junction proteins, mucus-secreting proteins, epithelial cell proliferation and apoptosis. Treg expansion revealed that rutin supplementation also exhibits an immune regulatory potential and suppresses inflammatory aggravation mediated by adaptive immune responses. Overall, results indicate that the modulation of p38/MK2 and PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta/NF-kappaB pathways by rutin represents a novel therapeutic approach in chronic colitis that help to curb dysregulated intestinal integrity, cytokine ratio and splenic Tregs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	18	8492	8506	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01557e					FSTA:2022-01-Aj0355
J		Ananda Pawar, D.; Kumar Giri, S.; Kumar Sharma, A.; Nachiket Kotwaliwale							Effect of abrasive pre-treatment on drying rate of grape berries and raisin quality.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Drying of grapes for the production of raisins is a slow and complex process. The prevalent chemical pre-drying treatment involves the use of chemicals which trigger food safety issues and such a method also takes a longer drying time for grapes. A novel industrial-scale abrasive pre-treatment system was developed and its operating parameters were optimized. The physical pre-treatment system consists of the rotating drum with its inner surface of specific abrasive protrusions. Optimized parameters using Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology as operating speed (15.13 rpm), treatment time (3.27 min), and sample size (8.45 kg), resulted in maximum treatment efficiency (97.76%), and minimum drying time (65.5 hr) for grape. The waxy cuticle layer was removed physically from the surface of grapes and hence the drying rate was found enhanced compared to chemical pre-treatment. Abrasive pre-treatment produced better quality raisins except slightly higher browning index (29.641.53) compared to chemical pre-treatment (26.190.93). Novelty impact statement. The study is about a chemical chemical-free process and equipment for the production of grape raisins with abrasive pre-treatment. Enhanced drying of grapes by abrasive pre-treatment (27.77% less drying time) compared to chemical pre-treatment. Developed industrial scale raisin making process has the potential to produce good quality, safe raisins without the use of chemicals and the process is environmental friendly. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15746					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0161

Food Microbiology					This study details a screening process for yeast species that may be used as reference microorganisms for mild thermal processing of orange juice. In the initial step, 17 different strains of spoilage yeasts with similar initial populations (6.0-7.0 log CFU/mL) and growth stage (middle stationary phase) were subjected to equal heating process (55 °C, 5 min) in Yeast Peptone Glucose Broth (pH 6.06). The change in populations observed ranged from 3.33 log CFU/mL (Pichia fermentans BFE-38) to 6.53 log CFU/mL (Torulaspora delbrueckii BFE-37). In the second step of the screening, 6 of the most resistant strains were further challenged in an orange juice suspending medium (pH 3.88, 10.02 °Brix, 0.82% citric acid) at different heating temperatures (50, 53, 55, 57, and 60 °C). The decimal reduction times (DT values) and thermal resistant constants (z values) were determined. Results showed that all tested yeasts exhibited first-order, log-linear inactivation behavior (R2 0.90-0.99). As expected, significant (P < 0.05) reduction in the DT values were observed with increasing temperature. P. fermentans BFE-38 exhibited the greatest Dvalues at 50-55 °C. However, the test isolate with the greatest z-value was found to be P. anomala (BIOTECH 2205). All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anastasiadi, M.; Falagan, N.; Rossi, S.; Terry, L. A.							A comprehensive study of factors affecting postharvest disorder development in celery.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Fresh-cut celery is an economically important crop, susceptible to postharvest disorders such as browning at cut ends, which can compromise quality and affect freshness perception. The study herein represents the most comprehensive attempt to date to determine the factors that mediate celery postharvest disorders and uncover the physiological and biochemical mechanisms involved. Three main experiments were conducted over two years, covering the early and late Spanish season and the late UK season. The aim of the experiments was to study: a) the effect of seasonal variation and horticultural maturity on shelf-life (20 °C) of fresh-cut celery; b) the effect of postharvest application of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) and continuous ethylene supplementation on browning and pithiness development during cold storage (5 °C); and c) the effect of preharvest deficit irrigation on the quality of fresh-cut celery during shelf-life (20 °C). Lesser horticultural maturity increased browning and pithiness with browning severity being positively correlated with chlorogenic acid concentrations in celery cut-ends. Ethylene supplementation accelerated the metabolic activity of celery, leading to early senescence. We found that 1-MCP suppressed respiration rate and delayed browning. Deficit irrigation promoted browning, which coincided with a rapid increase in abscisic acid and its main catabolite phaseic acid during storage. Mild deficit irrigation promoted the increase of chlorogenic acid after 6 d of storage, while severe deficit irrigation did not show this increase. These findings will help growers and retailers standardise industry practices ensuring uniform quality and better shelf-life estimations. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anastasiadis, F.; Apostolidou, I.; Michailidis, A.							Food traceability: a consumer-centric supply chain approach on sustainable tomato.		Foods					Technological advances result in new traceability configurations that, however, cannot always secure transparency and food safety. Even in cases where a system guarantees transparency, the actual consumer involvement and a real consumer-based perspective cannot always be ensured. The importance of such consumer centricity is vital, since it is strongly associated with effective supply chains that properly fulfil their end-users" needs and requests. Thus, the objective of this paper was to explore the level of consumer centricity in food supply chains under a traceability system. The methodological approach employed a framework of two studies validating subsequently a similar set of variables, using initially consumers data and then supply chain actors data. The supply chain of sustainable tomato was selected to design the studies. The level of agreement between datasets suggested the level of the supply chain consumer centricity. Findings showed health, trust, quality, nutrition, and safety-related values to be significant for the consumers towards accepting a traceability system. The supply chain actors also accepted a traceability system based on the fact that their customers" needs rely on the exact same beliefs, indicating a high level of consumer centricity. The current work underlines the magnitude of consumer centricity in food supply chains and provides an easy and straightforward framework for its exploration. Key implications suggest the design of more effective supply chain and consumer-based strategies for the food industry. Policymakers could also adopt the concept of consumer centricity to further improve the food industry. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Anastasiadis, F.; Alebaki, M.							Mapping the Greek wine supply Chain: a proposed research framework.		Foods					The wine industry involves both the production (i.e., from vine to wine) and consumption of wine (i.e., dining and tourism experiences). This results in a complicated system of intertwined product and services supply chains. Recent studies in the field suggest several key perspectives for future research, such as sustainability, resilience and circular economy. However, the complex nature of the sector which comprises numerous stakeholders and flows (i.e., products-services-information), entailing knotty interactions and interdependencies, makes any research direction questionable in terms of its effectiveness. Therefore, the objective of this study is to provide a tool for designing targeted future research in such multiple environments. We employed an end-to-end mapping approach using data from the Greek wine supply chain, identifying essential insights for a compelling research agenda. The key output is a set of three supply chain maps revealing the structure, processes and actors from all the main angles: basic production, value chain and stakeholders. A synthesis of these maps supports an overall understanding of the sector, unmasking any interaction and hidden information holdups. The study thus aims to offer an integrated research framework that highlights the leading priorities of the Greek wine industry. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, FPS Public Health, Food Chain Safety and Environment on behalf of Belgium (evaluating Member State, EMS) submitted an application to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance flupyradifurone and its metabolite difluoroacetic acid (DFA) in okra/lady's finger. The data submitted in support of the request were found sufficient to derive MRL proposals for the crop under consideration. The potential contribution of DFA residues in okra/lady's finger from the soil uptake was also estimated. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the relevant residues in the crop under consideration. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the long-term intake of residues of flupyradifurone and of its soil metabolite DFA resulting from the use of flupyradifurone is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. Due to the lack of proper consumption data of okra/lady's finger, the acute exposure assessment could not be reliably undertaken but due to this crop being a minor commodity it is unlikely that acute consumer intake concerns will be associated with this crop. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Syngenta Crop Protection AG submitted a request to the competent national authority in the Netherlands to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance difenoconazole in commodities belonging to the group of leafy brassica. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for leafy brassica. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of difenoconazole in plant matrices under consideration at the validated LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg and for difenoconazole and metabolite CGA205375 in animal matrices at the validated LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg for meat muscle, fat, liver, kidney and eggs and at the validated LOQ of 0.005 mg/kg for milk. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that for the crops assessed in this application the short-term intake of residues resulting from the use of difenoconazole according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health. Long-term consumer intake concerns cannot be excluded for the intended and existing difenoconazole uses as they are affected by uncertainties associated with the toxicity of metabolite CGA205375 and the lack of information on all existing difenoconazole uses in the EU. Overall, this risk assessment is considered provisional, pending the submission of confirmatory data on possible preferential metabolism/degradation of the four stereo isomers of difenoconazole in plants and has to be re-considered when the missing data become available. Additionally, this assessment does not take into consideration triazole derivative metabolites (TDMs) which may be generated by several pesticides belonging to the group of triazole fungicides as this application was submitted before September 2019 which is the date of application of the new strategy endorsed by the risk managers for the assessment of TDMs. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)				Modification of the existing maximum residue levels for acibenzolar-S-methyl in beans with pods and peas with pods.		EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Syngenta France SAS submitted a request to the competent national authority in France to amend the residue definition for risk assessment and to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance acibenzolar-S-methyl in beans (with pods) and peas (with pods). The toxicological data submitted in support of this MRL application were found to be sufficient to conclude that the plant metabolite 4-OH acibenzolar acid is not genotoxic in vitro, however lacking investigation of the general toxicity, a definitive conclusion cannot be derived whether 4-OH acibenzolar acid (free and conjugated) should be included or excluded from the residue definition for risk assessment for all commodities belonging to the groups of leafy crops and pulses/oilseeds. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals on the basis of the current residue definition (sum of acibenzolar-S-methyl and acibenzolar acid (free and conjugated), expressed as acibenzolar-S-methyl) for the intended uses on lettuces and salad plants, beans (with pods) and peas (with pods). The available residue trials are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 1 mg/kg for beans with pods and peas with pods. The submitted information did not provide evidence that the existing MRL has to be changed for the intended uses on lettuces and other salad plants. For herbs and edible flowers, data gaps were identified which precluded the derivation of MRL proposals. The consumer risk assessment for the current residue definition did not identify an unacceptable risk for consumers. The indicative exposure calculations performed for the metabolite 4-OH acibenzolar indicate that exposure to this metabolite is lower than the exposure to acibenzolar-S-methyl and acibenzolar acid (free and conjugated). However, considering the data gaps identified, a definitive conclusion cannot be derived by EFSA on the risk for consumers related to the intake of residues of 4-OH acibenzolar acid. The reliable end points appropriate for use in regulatory risk assessment are presented. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Cumulative dietary risk assessment of chronic acetylcholinesterase inhibition by residues of pesticides.		EFSA Journal					A retrospective cumulative risk assessment of dietary exposure to pesticide residues was conducted for chronic inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. The pesticides considered in this assessment were identified and characterised in a previous scientific report on the establishment of cumulative assessment groups of pesticides for their effects on the nervous system. The exposure assessments used monitoring data collected by Member States under their official pesticide monitoring programmes in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and individual food consumption data from 10 populations of consumers from different countries and from different age groups. Exposure estimates were obtained by means of a two-dimensional probabilistic model, which was implemented in SAS software. The characterisation of cumulative risk was supported by an uncertainty analysis based on expert knowledge elicitation. For each of the 10 populations, it is concluded with varying degrees of certainty that cumulative exposure to pesticides contributing to the chronic inhibition of acetylcholinesterase does not exceed the threshold for regulatory consideration established by risk managers. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)				Modification of the existing maximum residue levels for bentazone in beans and peas with and without pods.		EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant BASF SE submitted a request to the competent national authority in the Netherlands to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for bentazone in beans and peas with and without pods. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for peas with pods. Results from the residue trials indicated that there is no need to modify the existing MRLs for beans with pods, beans without pods and peas without pods. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of bentazone and its metabolites in the commodity under consideration at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. EFSA concluded that the proposed use of bentazone on peas with pods will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a risk to consumers' health for parent bentazone. The risk assessment however is indicative and affected by additional, non-standard uncertainties resulting from the insufficient information related to the toxicological properties for 6-hydroxy-bentazone in the wheat metabolism study. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)				Modification of the existing maximum residue levels for clopyralid in various commodities.		EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant Corteva submitted a request to the competent national authority in Finland to modify the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the active substance clopyralid in various commodities. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for wheat, oat and for animal commodities. An adequate analytical method for enforcement is available to control the residues of clopyralid in the plant commodities under consideration at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg. The analytical methods for animal commodities are validated at LOQ of 0.01 mg/kg, but demonstration of extraction efficiency is lacking. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concluded that the short-term and long-term intake of residues resulting from the use of clopyralid according to the reported agricultural practices is unlikely to present a risk to consumer health provided that risk mitigation measures are in place to avoid clopyralid residues in rotational and/or succeeding crops. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Reasoned opinion on the toxicological properties and maximum residue levels for propoxur.		EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the European Commission requested EFSA to prepare a reasoned opinion on the toxicological properties and the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) set for propoxur. EFSA was requested to assess the toxicological properties of propoxur and derive toxicological reference values, based on the toxicological assessment performed by Health Canada. EFSA was also requested to review the information provided by Member States and the UK on the metabolism of propoxur in plants and animals and on the current MRLs, as well as the limit of quantification (LOQ) that can be achieved with analytical methods used in MRL enforcement. Based on the information available to EFSA, toxicological reference values could not be derived for propoxur. No evidence was provided by Member States and UK that the existing EU MRLs need to be maintained as import tolerances. Information to support the current MRLs or alternative MRLs have not been provided by Member States and the UK. Codex MRLs are not in place. EFSA therefore recommended lowering of all existing EU MRLs for propoxur to the LOQ. According to the EU Reference Laboratories, sufficiently validated analytical methods are available to analyse for propoxur residues in all plant and animal commodities. Lacking toxicological reference values derived at EU level, a conclusion cannot be derived whether the setting of MRLs at the LOQs is sufficiently protective for the European consumers. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

J		Anbuhkani Muniandy; Patnarin Benyathiar; Dharmendra K. Mishra; Ferhan Ozadali							Dynamic thermal properties estimation using sensitivity coefficients for rapid heating process.		Foods					Thermal conductivity determination of food at temperatures > 100 °C still remains a challenge. The objective of this study was to determine the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity of food using rapid heating (TPCell). The experiments were designed based on scaled sensitivity coefficient (SSC), and the estimated thermal conductivity of potato puree was compared between the constant temperature heating at 121.10 °C (R12B10T1) and the rapid heating (R22B10T1). Temperature-dependent thermal conductivity models along with a constant conductivity were used for estimation. R22B10T1 experiment using the k model provided reliable measurements as compared to R12B10T1 with thermal conductivity values from 0.4630.011 W m-1 K-1 to 0.4500.016 W m-1 K-1 for 25-140 °C and root mean squares error (RMSE) of 1.441. In the R12B10T1 experiment, the analysis showed the correlation of residuals, which made the estimation less reliable. The thermal conductivity values were in the range of 0.4440.012 W m-1 K-1 to 0.5100.034 W m-1 K-1 for 20-120 °C estimated using the k model. Temperature-dependent models (linear and k models) provided a better estimate than the single parameter thermal conductivity determination with low RMSE for both types of experiments. SSC can provide insight in designing dynamic experiments for the determination of thermal conductivity coefficient. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Anchalee Ruengdech; Ubonrat Siripatrawan							Application of catechin nanoencapsulation with enhanced antioxidant activity in high pressure processed catechin-fortified coconut milk.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The efficiency of ultrasonic nanoemulsion to improve physical stability and antioxidant activity of catechins when exposed to stress conditions imitating food process was investigated. The catechin nanoemulsions (CaNE) were fabricated using ultrasonication and subjected to different stress conditions including pH (2-8), ionic strengths (200-1000 mmol/L NaCl) and temperatures (pasteurization, sterilization, and high pressure processing; HPP). Physical stability (droplet size and polydispersity index; PDI) and antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP values) of the CaNE were investigated during storage at 4 °C for 28 days. The developed CaNE showed good physical stability at various pH (2-8) and ionic strengths (200-600 mmol/L NaCl), whereas DPPH and FRAP values of the CaNE significantly decreased at pH > 6 and NaCl > 600 mmol/L. Pasteurization and sterilization induced an increase in droplet size and a decrease in antioxidant activity, whereas HPP had no effect on the CaNE. The efficiency of nanoemulsion to stabilize catechins in a high pressure processed catechin-fortified coconut milk (HPP-CM-CaNE) was investigated in comparison to HPP-CM and HPP-CM containing catechin solution (HPP-CM-Ca) during storage at 4 °C. The decrease in pH and antioxidant activity of HPP-CM-CaNE was less than those of HPP-CM-Ca, indicating that the nanoemulsion could enhance catechin stability in HPP-CM.

Sensitivity of proton NMR relaxation and proton NMR diffusion measurements to olive oil adulterations with vegetable oils.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Olive oils and, in particular, extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) are one of the most frauded food. Among the different adulterations of EVOOs, the mixture of high-quality olive oils with vegetable oils is one of the most common in the market. The need for fast and cheap techniques able to detect extra-virgin olive oil adulterations was the main motivation for the present research work based on 1H NMR relaxation and diffusion measurements. In particular, the 1H NMR relaxation times, T1 and T2, measured at 2 and 100 MHz on about 60 EVOO samples produced in Italy are compared with those measured on four different vegetable oils, produced from macadamia nuts, linseeds, sunflower seeds, and soybeans. Self-diffusion coefficients on this set of olive oils and vegetable oil samples were measured by means of the 1H NMR diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) technique, showing that, except for the macadamia oil, other vegetable oils are characterized by an average diffusion coefficient sensibly different from extra-virgin olive oils. Preliminary tests based on both NMR relaxation and diffusometry methods indicate that eventual adulterations of EVOO with linseed oil and macadamia oil are the easiest and the most difficult frauds to be detected, respectively.

J		Andersen, B. V.; Chan, R. C. K.; Byrne, D. V.							A conceptual framework for multi-dimensional measurements of food related pleasure-the food pleasure scale.		Foods					In modern times, the majority of food intake is believed to be driven by hedonic processes, rather than homeostatic ones. Various factors have been found to influence the hedonic eating experience and thereby influence eating behaviour, and each factor can be regarded a piece that contributes to parts of the total picture of the hedonic response to food. As a result, the literature on the hedonic response to food-related experiences is comprehensive, but at the same time rather fragmented; and importantly, it is not clear how individuals/segments differ in key drivers of their hedonic experience and the extent to which food pleasure is perceived. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for the development of a scale (self-report questionnaire) to measure the qualitative and quantitative aspects of food-related pleasure, the Food Pleasure Scale. We introduce the concept of (an)hedonia and scales developed in the past for its measurement, identify the spectrum of characteristics influencing food-related pleasure and explain the relevance of developing such a scale. Based on this theoretical framework, a strategy for the development of the Food Pleasure Scale is proposed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Andersen, P. V.; Afseth, N. K.; Gjerlaug-Enger, E.; Wold, J. P.							Prediction of water holding capacity and pH in porcine longissimus lumborum using Raman spectroscopy.		Meat Science					The main purpose of this study was to investigate if Raman spectra recorded at the exact same position as drip loss measurements could improve prediction of drip loss in pork. One ventral and one dorsal cylindrical plug, cut from a standardized slice from Longissimus lumborum, were used to determine drip loss by EZ-DripLoss method and to collect Raman spectra, while ultimate pH was measured at another location. Partial least squares regression models were developed using spectra from each plug individually or averaged spectra from both plugs. The best models used spectra from the ventral plug, resulting in rcv2=0.75, root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV)=1.27% and ratio of prediction to deviation (RPD) =2.0 for EZ-DripLoss and rcv2=0.72, RMSECV=0.05 and RPD=2.0 for ultimate pH. Results indicate that Raman spectroscopy can be used for rough screening of drip loss and pH in pork, and that the location chosen for collection of spectra can be very important for successful predictions.
