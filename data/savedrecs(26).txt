J		Benoit, N.; Dubois, M. J.; Pilon, G.; Varin, T. V.; Marette, A.; Bazinet, L.							Effects of herring milt hydrolysates and fractions in a diet-induced obesity model.		Foods					Over the past years, promising results from studies have shown that herring milt hydrolysates (HMH) can counter immune-metabolic disorders associated with obesity. However, more studies must corroborate these results. Thus, three commercial hydrolysates (HMH1, HMH2, and HMH3) as well as the fractions of two of them (HMH4 and HMH5) obtained by electrodialysis with ultrafiltration membranes (EDUF) were evaluated in vivo at higher doses compared to a previous study. To achieve this, seven groups of mice were fed for 8 weeks with either a control Chow diet or an obesogenic diet rich in fat and sucrose (HFHS) and supplemented by daily gavage with water or 312.5 mg/kg of one of the five HMH products. In summary, HMH supplements had no impact on weight gain. In the insulin tolerance test (ITT), HMH2 and its HMH5 fraction significantly reduced the blood sugar variation (p< 0.05). However, during the glucose tolerance (OGTT), HMH2 supplement increased the hyperinsulinemia variation (p< 0.05) induced by the HFHS diet. HMH1, HMH2, and HMH5 supplements generated potentially beneficial changes for health in the gut microbiota. These results reveal that HMH do not counteract obesity effects but may decrease certain physiological effects induced by obesity. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

The brown seaweed Cystoseira schiffneri as a source of sodium alginate: chemical and structural characterization, and antioxidant activities.		Food Bioscience					Sodium alginates were extracted from brown seaweeds (Cystoseira schiffneri) collected from a Tunisian island (Kerkennah, Sfax) in different seasons (December, April, July and September). The structural features and antioxidant properties of C. schiffneri sodium alginates (CSSA) were characterized. Micro-elementary analysis showed the absence of nitrogen and sulfur in alginate fractions. All alginate isolates were high in uronic acids (47.4-66.4%) and ash (24.3-39.4%). ATR-FTIR, NMR and circular dichroism data showed that all CSSA were of the polyguluronate-type. Weight-average molecular weight determined using high performance size exclusion chromatography showed variations ranging from 4.49 to 1230 kDa. Thermogravimetric analysis suggested that CSSA were stable until 400 °C except for that collected in September, which was observed to only be stable until 200 °C. Antioxidant activity of CSSA from different seasons was measured using DPPH radical-scavenging, reducing power and Fe2+ chelating ability assays. Antioxidant potential of CSSA varied significantly with respect to the season and the main factor controlling antioxidant properties was the molecular mass.

Brown seaweed Cystoseiraschiffneri as a promising source of sulfated fucans: seasonal variability of structural, chemical, and antioxidant properties.		Food Science & Nutrition					A fucoidan, sulfated polysaccharide, was extracted from the brown seaweed Cystoseira schiffneri during 4 harvest periods (December, April, July, and September) and studied for its structural and chemical properties. The Cystoseira schiffneri fucoidan (CSF) showed important variation in sulfate content ranging from 7.8% in December to 34.8% in July. This was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies showing characteristic signals of sulfated polysaccharides. Molecular mass of the CSF varied as a function of season from 3,745 in December to 26,390 Da in July. Gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy showed that CSF fractions were "mannogalactofucans" composed mainly of mannose, fucose, and galactose with low levels of other monosaccharides. Moreover, interesting in vitro antioxidant activities that depend on the harvest season were noted for CSF. Thus, the present work might contribute to establish criteria for extracting bioactive fucoidans from an endemic Tunisian seaweed C. schiffneri. © 2021 The Authors.

Chemical profile of colorful bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) flours: changes influenced by the cooking method.		Food Chemistry					This study aimed to determine how the cooking methods change the phenolics and saponins profiles, oligosaccharides, antinutrients and antioxidant properties of flours from colorful beans. The autoclave cooking consisted of: 6 h soaking and 5 min cooking (C5); and 20 min cooking without soaking (C20). Both cooking methods significantly promote changes on the chemical compounds studied, and the intensity of these variations were affected by the cultivars. Most of flours of C5 beans presented a lower loss of anthocyanins (3.9-70.0%), DPPH (11.7-87.2%), ABTS (0.0-82.7%), and tannins (0.0-90.0%) compared with C20. The cooked flours of Artico and Realce showed some similarities among chemical compounds, as well as the lowest concentration of tannins (0.0 mg.g-1), antioxidant activity (0.40 mol Trolox.g-1), and higher amounts of oligosaccharides and acetylcholine. Most of cooked flours presented a reduction in phenolics and soyasaponins alphag and betag, and an increase in soyasaponins Ba and I and oligosaccharides (mainly C20 flours).

J		Bento, J. A. C.; Ferreira, K. C.; Bassinello, P. Z.; Oomah, B. D.							Factors affecting the cooking quality of stored carioca beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).		Italian Journal of Food Science					The culinary quality of carioca beans is related to their market value and consumer acceptability. The depreciation of the cooking/technological quality of the product occurs mainly because of the integument browning and the longer cooking time of the grains, which are influenced by the storage time and conditions. The loss of culinary quality reduces the market value of carioca beans because consumers reject darkened grains that are attributed to a longer cooking time. As a result, cooking time (resistance to cooking), the color of the integument, and the texture of the cooked beans are determinant factors in the acceptance of carioca bean cultivars. The browning of the grain integument and the cooking time mainly depends on the environmental conditions, storage time, the tegument of each genotype, and the chemical and physical properties of the cotyledons. Therefore, this review aims to survey the scientific literature on the extrinsic and intrinsic factors that affect the culinary quality of carioca beans.

Functional and pasting properties of colorful bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) flours: influence of the cooking method.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This research aimed to verify how the preparation method affects the functional and technological properties of colorful bean flours to expand their potential for application in various food products. The flour of the cultivar BRS Embaixador (dark red kidney bean) presented the highest total starch content (40.5 g.100 g-1), and the lowest content of resistant starch (3.2 g.100 g-1) and protein (20.9 g.100 g-1), while Jalo Precoce (yellow bean) showed the highest amount of resistant starch (24.3 g.100 g-1) and protein (25.8 g.100 g-1). The cooked flours compared with the raw ones presented a reduction in water solubility index, peak viscosity, final viscosity, breakdown, seatback, hardness, adhesiveness, resilience, and emulsification capacity. These results were more evident in flours from presoaked and cooked beans once they had presented a significantly higher intensity of the starch pre-gelatinization. Finally, both preparation processes (presoaked cooked beans or unsoaked cooked beans) improved the technological characteristics of colorful bean flours. Practical applications. We have obtained the cooked colorful bean flours by applying an unusual method previously tested. The bean grains (previously soaked or not) were cooked only by the effect of the pressured steam environment of the autoclave without immersion in water during cooking. Our interest is to expand the use of colorful bean flour by improving its acceptability in various food systems. We show that the flour of presoaked cooked grains presented a higher amount of resistant starch and lower viscosities values, which may be suitable for a food system that desires no viscosity changes (e.g., soups). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Phenolic and saponin profile in grains of carioca beans during storage.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The objective of this study was to evaluate the behavior of slow and fast-darkening carioca beans during storage, and the profile of phenolics and saponins, aiming to identify which compounds may be involved in the browning process of the integument of these grains. Cultivars Madreperola and Dama presented the lowest total color difference (DeltaE) and the highest luminosity (L*) values during storage time indicating to be slow-darkening cultivars. In contrast, the cultivars Notavel and Imperador rapidly darkened with storage time, evidenced by the highest DeltaE and lowest L*. Regarding the content of phenolic during storage, it was observed a reduction for free phenolics in fast-darkening beans and the maintenance/increase in slow-darkening beans. In the PCA of the phenolic profile, Notavel and Imperador were similar, differing from Dama and Madreperola, indicating that fast-darkening grains have similar phenolic profile. The OPLS/DA indicated that aged grains from bright beans had more kaempferol than darker beans. For saponins, the cultivars Imperador and Notavel presented higher content of Soyasaponin Bd, which might be related to the darkening process. Besides, kaempferol was found at higher concentrations in slow-darkening aged grains and can be a chemical marker of darkening in carioca beans. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Benucci, I.; Esti, M.							Arginase activity characterization during alcoholic fermentation by sequential inoculation with non-Saccharomyces and Saccharomyces yeast.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Arginine uptake and yeast arginase activity were studied throughout the alcoholic fermentation of a white grape must (Vitis vinifera L. Cv Fiano), carried out by sequential inoculation (Torulaspora delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae, TD-SC) and compared with a S. cerevisiae single fermentation (SC). In both samples, yeast assimilable nitrogen (YAN) consumption was mainly during the early phase of alcoholic fermentation (before S. cerevisiae addition in the sequential fermentation). T. delbrueckii alone and S. cerevisiae similarly metabolized YAN, which was further consumed in TD-SC sample following the S. cerevisiae inoculation. The only relevant arginine uptake was found about 3 days after the first inoculum (simultaneously with the greatest YAN consumption) and it appeared to be higher in SC (0.24 g/L) than in TD-SC (0.12 g/L). The kinetic parameters, estimated by means of the Hill equation, and in particular Vmax values (56.01.6 U/mgBSAeq at 48 h for SC and 73.32.7 U/mgBSAeq at 66 h for TD-SC) indicated the maximum arginase activity at the same point of time corresponding to the lowest YAN amount (48 h for S. cerevisiae and 66 h for T. delbrueckii). ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Benucci, I.; Cecchi, T.; Lombardelli, C.; Maresca, D.; Mauriello, G.; Esti, M.							Novel microencapsulated yeast for the primary fermentation of green beer: kinetic behavior, volatiles and sensory profile.		Food Chemistry					The development of innovative and more cost-effective approaches of making beer throughout continuous fermentation process remains a challenging problem, which is worthy of serious exploration. The current work focuses on the application of a commercial brewing yeast (S. cerevisiae Nottingham Ale), entrapped into chitosan-calcium alginate double layer microcapsules, for the production of a Pale Ale beer. During the primary alcoholic fermentation, the consumption rate of fermentable brewing sugars and dissolved O2, estimated by the Gompertz equation, was halved in the beer obtained by encapsulated yeast in comparison with the free cell. The physical-chemical parameters of beer (i.e.pH, alcohol content, color and bitterness) were not remarkably affected by the different yeast-inoculating form. However, the volatile profiles identified by means of HS-SPME-GC-MS analysis, significantly differed in terms of terpenes, esters and alcohols content, thus proving that the yeast-inoculating form may typify the odor and flavor descriptors of the green beer.

J		Benvenutti, L.; Zielinski, A. A. F.; Ferreira, S. R. S.							Jaboticaba (Myrtaceae cauliflora) fruit and its by-products: alternative sources for new foods and functional components.		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. There is a high demand for food and pharmaceutical products enriched with natural compounds to replace synthetic additives, contributing to human health and the immune system. The jaboticaba (family Myrtaceae) is a Brazilian berry, little known and scarcely used, but with high biological potential, such as antioxidant, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anti-obesity, cardioprotective, and antiproliferative. Its industrial by-product is composted by peel, seeds, and adhered pulp, with the same phytochemicals from fruit. Therefore, jaboticaba and its by-products are sources of compounds with health benefits and technological functions, being an emerging fruit with high potential applications in food, supplements, and pharmacological formulations. Scope and approach. This overview summarizes the characteristics of jaboticaba, phytochemicals, health benefits, technological functions, methods to obtain and protect the biological compounds, and application trends of jaboticaba fruit and by-product. Key findings and conclusions. The jaboticaba fruit and its by-products can be used to supplement or create novel products with health and technological benefits, by applying concepts such as circular economy and biorefinery. The jaboticaba processing takes the advantage of this raw material for the development of innovative and healthier products. Furthermore, the use of jaboticaba by-products can promote more efficient utilization of natural resources. However, the combination of specifics in vitro, in vivo, and clinical trial assays must be performed to confirm the benefits to human health or attest these food ingredients as functional or nutraceutical.

J		Benxi Wei; Hongna Qi; Jin Zou; Hongyan Li; Jing Wang; Baoguo Xu; Haile Ma							Degradation mechanism of amylopectin under ultrasonic irradiation.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, amylopectin was ultrasonicated and a significant decrease in Mw was detected with extension of the processing time using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography equipped with refractive index detector and multi-angle laser-light scattering. The degradation mechanism was interpreted by means of chain length distribution characterization and1H NMR spectrum. The disruption of amylopectin was indicated by a preferential degradation of larger molar mass of amylopectin which generating molecular fragments at about the same size, and degree of the maximum degradation was based on a critical molecular size which equalled to the diffusion layer of the collapsed cavitation bubbles in ultrasonic irradiation. The break points firstly occurred at B3 chains (midpoint scission) and then at B2 chains (midpoint scission) with an increase of A chains contents, which resulted in a much narrower molecular size distribution. Both of the alpha-1,4-and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds in B3 and B2 chains were disrupted in ultrasonic irradiation. However, alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds was more likely to break as the degree of branching of the samples decreased with the extension of processing time.

Amore, T. d'						Different use of nitrite and nitrate in meats: a survey on typical and commercial Italian products as a contribution to risk assessment.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Nitrite and nitrate are food additives largely investigated in meats. Their levels depend on the specific product characteristics, and no study concerning these differences is available. This study presents the first monitoring on the specific levels of nitrite and nitrate in different types of meat products. Thirteen types of meat products were collected and analyzed using validated and accredited analytical techniques based on ion chromatography with conductivity detection. The highest levels of nitrite were detected in wurstel and Bresaola, while the lowest were detected in seasoned sausage. Ten samples contained nitrate concentrations higher than the EU legal limits, confirming the need of official control. The highest levels of nitrate were detected in Bresaola, followed by Speck; the lowest were detected in canned meat, cooked ham and cooked meat. Relating to the overall nitrite and nitrate levels, Bresaola showed the highest levels, followed by Speck. Lower levels were detected in Mortadella, cooked meat and cooked ham. The lowest concentrations of nitrite/nitrate were registered in canned meat. A contribution to risk assessment was also presented. The highest percentage of ADI, under high exposure scenario, was obtained for cooked ham samples (8.31%) and for ham consumption (0.40%) relating to nitrite and nitrate, respectively.

J		Bercik, J.; Paluchova, J.; Neomaniova, K.							Neurogastronomy as a tool for evaluating emotions and visual preferences of selected food served in different ways.		Foods					The appearance of food provides certain expectations regarding the harmonization of taste, delicacy, and overall quality, which subsequently affects not only the intake itself but also many other features of the behavior of customers of catering facilities. The main goal of this article is to find out what effect the visual design of food (waffles) prepared from the same ingredients and served in three different ways-a stone plate, street food style, and a white classic plate-has on the consumer's preferences. In addition to the classic tablet assistance personal interview (TAPI) tools, biometric methods such as eye tracking and face reading were used in order to obtain unconscious feedback. During testing, air quality in the room by means of the Extech device and the influence of the visual design of food on the perception of its smell were checked. At the end of the paper, we point out the importance of using classical feedback collection techniques (TAPI) and their extension in measuring subconscious reactions based on monitoring the eye movements and facial expressions of the respondents, which provides a whole new perspective on the perception of visual design and serving food as well as more effective targeting and use of corporate resources. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Berdejo, D.; Pagan, E.; Merino, N.; Garcia-Gonzalo, D.; Pagan, R.							Emerging mutant populations of Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e under selective pressure of Thymbra capitata essential oil question its use in food preservation.		Food Research International					Due to their excellent antimicrobial properties, essential oils (EO) have been proposed as potential preservatives for certain kinds of foods, such as dairy products. However, the occurrence of pathogenic populations that are resistant to EOs could pose a health risk. This report seeks to assess the emergence of resistant populations in Listeria monocytogenes EGD-e growth at 37 °C under selective pressure of Thymbra capitata EO (TCO), to characterise their resistance in laboratory media, and to identify their genotypic changes, as well as to evaluate the resistance in skimmed milk. TCO cyclic treatment allowed the isolation of two L. monocytogenes EGD-e resistant strains against the EO: LmSTCO by sublethal doses (75 L/L TCO) and LmLTCO by lethal doses (300 L/L TCO) after 20 and 30 cycles, respectively. Both strains displayed an increase of the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentration against TCO and a higher survival rate after lethal treatments than the wild-type strain (LmWT). Growth kinetics revealed a better adaptation of LmSTCO in presence of TCO, while LmLTCO grew more slowly compared to LmWT, even in the absence of the antimicrobial. Moreover, a slight increase in cross-resistance to antibiotics was observed: LmSTCO to beta-lactams and LmLTCO to a series of broad-spectrum antibiotics. The genomic study revealed one sole nucleotide change in LmSTCO located in plsC gene codifying an enzyme involved in the production of phosphatidic acid, a precursor in cell membrane synthesis. Five genetic variations were found in LmLTCO: among them, the deletion of an ATP-synthesis system involved in slowing bacterial growth. Inhibition and inactivation assays in skimmed milk confirmed the increased resistance of both strains, thereby indicating a safety risk in case these strains emerge in the food chain. These results strongly suggest that the occurrence of such resistances should be taken into account in order to ensure the efficacy of natural antimicrobials in the design of food preservation strategies.

J		Berdejo, D.; Pagan, E.; Merino, N.; Botello-Morte, L.; Pagan, R.; Garcia-Gonzalo, D.							Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium genetic variants isolated after lethal treatment with Thymbra capitata essential oil (TCO) showed increased resistance to TCO in milk.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					The high prevalence of Salmonella enterica in milk poses a risk of considerable concern in the preservation of certain dairy products, mainly those elaborated from raw milk. Essential oils (EOs) have been proposed as a promising food preservative for such products due to their strong antimicrobial properties. Additionally, these natural antimicrobials have been shown to be effective against multi-drug resistant strains. They can thus also be utilized to prevent the dissemination of antimicrobial resistances (AMR). However, recent evidence of the development of bacterial resistance under EO treatments may call their use into question. This study sought to assess the emergence of antimicrobial resistant genetic variants of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium from survivors after cyclic exposure to lethal doses (>5 log10 cycles of inactivation) of Thymbra capitata EO (TCO), in order to evaluate the impact that it could have on milk preservation, to ascertain whether cross-resistance to antibiotics occurs, and to identify the genomic changes responsible for their phenotype. Isolated strains by TCO (SeTCO) showed a two-fold increase in minimum inhibitory and bactericide concentrations (MIC and MBC) of TCO compared to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium wild-type strain (SeWT) in laboratory growth medium, as well as a greater adaptation and growth rate in the presence of the EOs and a higher survival to TCO treatments in buffers of pH 4.0 and 7.0. The increased resistance of SeTCO was confirmed in skimmed milk: 300 muL/L TCO reduced only 1 log10 cycle of SeTCO population, whereas it inactivated more than 5 log10 cycles in SeWT. Moreover, SeTCO showed an increased cross-resistance against aminoglycosides, quinolones and tetracyclines. Whole genome sequencing revealed 5 mutations in SeTCO: 2 in genes involved in O-antigens synthesis (rfbV and rfbX), 2 in genes related to adaptation to the growing medium (trkA and glpK), and 1 in a redox-sensitive transcriptional regulator (soxR) . The phenotypic characterization of a constructed SeWT strain with mutant soxRSeTCO demonstrated that the mutation of soxR was the main cause of the increased resistance and tolerance observed in SeTCO against TCO and antibiotics. The emergence of resistant strains against EOs might jeopardize their use as food preservatives. Further studies will thus be required to determine under which conditions such resistant strains might occur, and to assess the food risk they may pose, as well as to ascertain their impact on the spread of AMR.

Restriction of dietary advanced glycation end products induces a differential plasma metabolome and lipidome profile.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Diets with low content in advanced glycation end products (AGEs) lead to beneficial properties in highly prevalent age-related diseases. To shed light on the mechanisms behind, the changes induced by a low AGE dietary intervention in the circulating metabolome are analyzed. Methods and Results. To this end, 20 non-diabetic patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis are randomized to continue their usual diet or to one with a low content of AGEs for 1 month. Then, plasmatic metabolome and lipidomes are analyzed by liquid-chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The levels of defined AGE structures are also quantified by ELISA and by mass-spectrometry. The results show that the low AGE diet impinged significant changes in circulating metabolomes (166 molecules) and lipidomes (91 lipids). Metabolic targets of low-AGE intake include sphingolipid, ether-lipids, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Further, it reproduces some of the plasma characteristics of healthy aging. Conclusion. The finding of common pathways induced by low-AGE diets with previous metabolic traits implicated in aging, insulin resistance, and obesity suggest the usefulness of the chosen approach and supports the potential extension of this study to other populations. © 2021 The Authors.

Temporal dynamics of probiotic Lacticaseibacillus casei and rhamnosus abundance in a fermented dairy product evaluated using a combination of cultivation-dependent and -independent methods.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Benchmark of cost-efficient and accurate methods for quantifying probiotics in dairy products represents great interest to the food industry. The advantages of cultivation-independent techniques over the traditionally used cultivation-based ones are to be investigated in this context. We evaluated the levels of Lacticaseibacillus casei and rhamnosus in multiple formulations of a fermented dairy product fortified with these probiotics during the shelf-life using cultivation, taxon-specific qPCR augmented with propidium monoazide (PMA) viability test and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The analyzed products were the yogurts produced with traditional yogurts starter cultures including Bifidobacteria or without them. The effect of the starter culture on probiotics viability and abundance was assessed. The methods for probiotic profiling were compared. All methods confirmed high levels for the probiotics throughout the shelf-life. The PMA-qPCR showed that their non-viable proportion was low. The formulations with the starter cultures including Streptococcus and Lactobacillus were associated with a lower abundance of each probiotic compared to those that additionally had Bifidobacterium in the starter culture. The total microbial composition according to the sequencing was generally as expected, but the method was of limited use for profiling the probiotic levels due to the data compositionality and dominance of the starter culture taxa.

Metabolites of 2- and 3-monochloropropanediol (2- and 3-MCPD) in humans: urinary excretion of 2-chlorohydracrylic acid and 3-chlorolactic acid after controlled exposure to a single high dose of fatty acid esters of 2- and 3-MCPD.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Fatty acid esters of 2-monochloropropane-1,3-diol (2-MCPD) and 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) are formed during the deodorization of vegetable oils. After lipase-catalyzed hydrolysis in the intestine, 2-and 3-MCPD are absorbed, but their ensuing human metabolism is unknown. Methods and results. The compounds 2-chlorohydracrylic acid (2-ClHA) and 3-chlorolactic acid (3-ClLA) resulting from oxidative metabolism of 2-MCPD and 3-MCPD, respectively, are identified and quantified in human urine samples. An exposure study with 12 adults is conducted to determine the urinary excretion of 2-ClHA and 3-ClLA. The participants eat 12 g of hazelnut oil containing 24.2 mg kg-1 2-MCPD and 54.5 mg kg-1 3-MCPD in the form of fatty acid esters. Average daily amounts of "background" excretion before the exposure are 69 nmol 2-ClHA and 3.0 nmol 3-ClLA. The additional mean excretion due to the uptake of the hazelnut oil amounts to 893 nmol 2-ClHA (34.0% of the 2-MCPD dose) and 16.4 nmol 3-ClLA (0.28% of the 3-MPCD dose). Conclusions. The products of oxidative metabolism of 2-and 3-MCPD, 2-ClHA, and 3-ClLA, are described for the first time in humans. Due to the lack of specificity, the metabolites may not be used as exposure biomarkers to low doses of bound 2-and 3-MCPD, respectively. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Bergen, G. van; Zandstra, E. H.; Kaneko, D.; Dijksterhuis, G. B.; Wijk, R. A. de							Sushi at the beach: effects of congruent and incongruent immersive contexts on food evaluations.		Food Quality and Preference					Prior research using immersive technology has shown that consumption contexts can be successfully recreated to elicit effects on hedonic food evaluations, but the food-specificity of these effects is as of yet unclear. The current study investigates how repeated exposure to foods in congruent and incongruent immersive contexts affects hedonic perception over time. Two groups of participants (N=23, N=18) were exposed to three food products (sushi, popsicle and iced tea) in either an immersive beach context or an immersive sushi restaurant context for seven days. On the eighth day, participants were exposed to the same foods once more, but switched to the other context. Hedonic evaluations were collected prior to and during tasting at initial exposure (day 1), after repeated exposure to the same context (day 7) and in the switched context (day 8); consumption behavior was monitored on exposure days (days 2-6). Results showed that prior to tasting, expected liking and desire to eat were higher for congruent food-context combinations (popsicle at the beach, sushi in the sushi restaurant) than for incongruent combinations (popsicle in the sushi restaurant, sushi at the beach). Upon tasting, no differences were found in average food liking, but individual liking ratings for congruent (vs. incongruent) food-context combinations were more consistent over time. Immersive contexts also elicited general effects, such that a typical consumption environment (sushi restaurant) increased food consumption and yielded more consistent product liking ratings over time. Findings underline the importance of taking a holistic view on consumer testing, and showcase the potential of immersive technology.

J		Berger, J.; Dalheimer, B.; Brummer, B.							Effects of variable EU import levies on corn price volatility.		Food Policy					The variable import levy for corn imports in the European Union aims to support European producers by insulating domestic prices from low international prices. Such price-insulating policies have been associated with an increase in global market volatility. Eliminating these distortions has been one of the key issues in international negotiations on agricultural trade liberalization, e.g., the commitment of WTO member states to follow the principle of tariffication as part of the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture. Nevertheless, the Blair House Agreement effectively allowed the EU to maintain a variable import levy regime for grain imports, although the magnitude of this levy is substantially smaller than in the past. Notwithstanding that this policy has been a cornerstone of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, empirical evidence on the magnitude of its effects on price volatility is largely missing. This paper employs a multivariate asymmetric volatility model to assess these effects on domestic and foreign corn markets, using Argentina-a large exporter of corn-as an example. In line with the relevant theoretical literature, we find empirical evidence for the 2002-2017 period that the variable import levy reduced corn price volatility in the EU market, while significantly increasing volatility to the same extent in Argentina. In a distorted sense, the import levy of the EU has thus been a success, as its variable application rate has stabilized prices in the EU domestic market. However, our results show that this policy has merely shifted price volatility abroad since it has led to increases in price volatility in Argentina. A less distortionary policy to target the problems of agricultural price volatility should shift its focus away from direct price interventions. For instance, domestic policies that improve farmers' ability to cope with price-related risks would avoid the negative effects of domestic price stabilization in foreign countries.

Xylooligosaccharides increase Bifidobacteria and Lachnospiraceae in mice on a high-fat diet, with a concomitant increase in short-chain fatty acids, especially butyric acid.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Effects of xylooligosaccharides (XOSs) as well as a mixture of XOS, inulin, oligofructose, and partially hydrolyzed guar gum (MIX) in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) were studied. Control groups were fed an HFD or a low-fat diet. Special attention was paid to the cecal composition of the gut microbiota and formation of short-chain fatty acids, but metabolic parameters were also documented. The XOS group had significantly higher cecum levels of acetic, propionic, and butyric acids than the HFD group, and the butyric acid content was higher in the XOS than in the MIX group. The cecum microbiota of the XOS group contained more Bifidobacteria, Lachnospiraceae, and S24-7 bacteria than the HFD group. A tendency of lower body weight gain was observed on comparing the XOS and HFD groups. In conclusion, the XOS was shown to be a promising prebiotic candidate. The fiber diversity in the MIX diet did not provide any advantages compared to the XOS diet.		; Nordberg Karlsson, Eva/D-1426-2015	Stalbrand, Henrik/0000-0001-9517-6428; Bhattacharya, Abhishek/0000-0002-4861-1674; Adlercreutz, Patrick/0000-0001-9923-3397; Nordberg Karlsson, Eva/0000-0002-8597-7050							2021	69	12	3617	3625	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06279					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10985

Microbial quality of raw cow milk and its predictors along the dairy value chain in Southwest Ethiopia.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Raw milk may contain pathogenic microorganism that can seriously affect the health of consumers. In Southwest Ethiopia, raw cow milk is consumed more than the processed products, but its microbiological quality and its predictors are not studied well. The aim of this study was to determine the microbial quality of raw cow milk and its predictors along the dairy value chain in Southwest Ethiopia. A total of 150 milk and 300 environmental samples were collected randomly from dairy farms, milk distribution centers, and retailer outlets for microbiological analysis using standard protocols. One milk handler from each milk production or distribution stage was also interviewed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding milk handling. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression models were used to summarize the data and to identify predictors of milk microbial quality, respectively. As the milk transported from dairy farm to milk retailer outlet, the mean total bacterial count has increased from 5.00.3 to 7.20.1 log CFU/ml respectively. The mean coliform count of the milk sample was 4.40.4 log CFU/ml at the dairy farm and 7.00.2 log CFU/ml at milk selling points, indicating the deterioration of milk quality along the dairy value chain. All of the analyzed water samples were positive for fecal coliform bacteria. The highest coliform bacteria were reported from milk storage equipment found at milk retailer outlet with the count of 4.80.5 log CFU/ml. Educational status and attitude of milk handlers and the quality of water used to wash milk equipment and hands of milk handlers were the major factors affecting the microbial quality of raw cow milk. The findings of this study revealed that the microbial quality of raw milk in the study area was poor. Hence, improving the attitude and educational status of milk handlers, and the quality of water is an important step to enhance milk quality and consequently to prevent milk borne diseases.

J		Beriain, M. J.; Ibanez, F. C.; Beruete, E.; Gomez, I.; Beruete, M.							Estimation of fatty acids in intramuscular fat of beef by FT-MIR spectroscopy.		Foods					The aim of this research was to estimate the fatty acid (FA) content of intramuscular fat from beef by Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy. Four diets were supplemented in 10% linseed (LS) and/or 2% conjugated linoleic acid (CLA): CON (without L or CLA), LS, CLA, and LS+CLA. For each diet, 12 young Holstein bulls were allocated. The spectral response of the beef samples was analyzed applying FT-MIR spectroscopy (from 400 to 4000 cm-1) and predictive models were developed using partial least square regression with cross-validation. The obtained coefficients (R2) for some FA, such as alpha-linolenic acid with a R2=0.96 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) with R2=0.93, demonstrate that FT-MIR spectroscopy is a valid technique to estimate the content of FA. In addition, samples were correctly classified according to the animal diet using discriminant analysis in the region 3000-1000 cm-1. The obtained results suggest that the FT-MIR spectroscopy could be a viable technique for routine use in quality control because it provides fast and sustainable analysis of FA content. Furthermore, this technique allows the rapid estimation of the FA composition, specifically n-3 PUFA and CLA, of nutritional interest in meat. It also allows the classification of meat samples by the animal diet. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Physicochemical and sensory assessments in Spain and United States of PGI-Certified Ternera de Navarra vs. Certified Angus beef.		Foods					The physicochemical and sensory differences between the PGI-Certified Ternera de Navarra (CTNA) (Spanish origin) and Certified Angus Beef (CAB) (US origin) were assessed in Spain and the USA. To characterize the carcasses, the ribeye areas (REAs), and marbling levels were assessed in both testing places. Twenty striploins per certified beef program were used as study samples. For sensory analysis, the striploins were vacuum packaged and aged for 7 days at 4 °C and 85% RH in each corresponding laboratory. Thereafter, the samples were half cut and frozen. One of the halves was shipped to the other counterpart-testing place. The fat and moisture percentage content, Warner Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF), and total and soluble collagen were tested for all the samples. The CAB carcasses had smaller REAs (p< 0.0001) and exhibited higher marbling levels (p< 0.0001). The CAB striploins had a higher fat content (p< 0.0001) and required lower WBSF (p< 0.05) than the CTNA samples. Trained panelists rated the CAB samples as juicer (p< 0.001), more tender/less tough (p< 0.0001), and more flavorful (p< 0.0001) than the CTNA counterparts. This study shows that beef from both countries had medium-high tenderness, juiciness, and beef flavor scores and very low off-flavor scores. Relevant differences found between the ratings assigned by the Spanish and the US panelists suggest training differences, or difficulties encountered in using the appropriate terminology for defining each sensory attribute. Furthermore, the lack of product knowledge (i.e., consumption habits) may have been another reason for such differences, despite the blind sensory evaluation. © 2021 by the authors.

Formation of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and glycation products in sesame (Sesamum indicum L.) seeds during roasting: a multiresponse kinetic modelling approach.		European Food Research and Technology					This study aims to investigate the formation mechanism of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and glycation products in sesame seeds during roasting. The changes in the concentrations of sucrose, bound lysine, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, N-epsilon-fructoselysine, N-epsilon-carboxymethyllysine and N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine were observed in sesame samples roasted at 180, 200 and 220 °C for different time intervals to form a comprehensive kinetic model consisting of elementary steps for these products. Model results indicated that N-epsilon-carboxyethyllysine was originated from the reaction between methylglyoxal and bound lysine while N-epsilon-carboxymethyllysine formation was formed predominantly by the oxidation of N-epsilon-fructoselysine compared to the reaction of glyoxal with bound lysine. In addition, N-epsilon-fructoselysine was found to be mostly contributed to the formation of 1-deoxyglucosone, which was the most important precursor of methylglyoxal and diacetyl formation in roasted sesame seeds. 3-Deoxyglucosone and glyoxal were mainly formed from the glucose degradation. Among the reaction steps, the degradation of 1-deoxyglucosone was found to be the fastest one. In this study, the multiresponse kinetic modelling approach, which provided a better understanding the important pathways on the formation of advanced glycation end-products, was reported first in a real food system. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

New bioactive constituents characterized by LC-MS/MS in optimized microwave extract of jujube seeds (Zizyphus lotus L.).		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The present study was aimed to optimize the extraction conditions of total phenolic contents (TPC) from Zizyphus lotus seeds (Zls) samples by microwave procedure using response surface methodology in order to obtain maximum extraction yields. Central Composite Design was employed with three factors defined as solvent concentration (X1), irradiation power (X2) and microwave power (X3) at three coded levels on the TPC recovery. The optimal conditions for X1, X2 and X3 were: ethanol 60%, 210 s and 600 W, respectively. The experimental value of TPC yields was for 6709.01 2.20 mg GAE/100 g which is in close agreement with the predicted value indicating the model success. Results showed that optimized Zls extract exhibited a high inhibitory effect on some biological activities including antioxidants and enzyme inhibition. The liquid chromatography-high resolution tandem mass spectrometry profile revealed 47 active compounds where 21 were never been detected in Zizyphus genus. The Zls extract was found to contain significant major compounds comprised 6-methyl-2-O-glucoside xanthone, jasminoside isomer, citric acid, gallocatechin, imidazole carboxylate derivative, kaempferol-3-O-robinobioside, 6-gingerol, 2-hydroxy-2-methyl-1-[4-[3-(2,4, 5-trihydroxyhexan-3-yloxy) propyl] phenyl] propan-1-one, 3-(decyloxy)-2-hydroxy-propyl prop-2-enoate, tenasogenin and some small peptides. The findings demonstrated the beneficial application of microwave method for an increase extraction of TPC amounts from Zls extracts that could be valorized in food and pharmaceutical industries. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Effect of drying method and process conditions on physicochemical and rheological properties of arabinoxylans extracted from corn-lime-cooking-liquor on a pilot plant scale.		Food Hydrocolloids					Corn-lime-cooking-liquor (nejayote), which is a pollutant wastewater from the corn-tortilla-industry, contains valuable products, such as arabinoxylans (AXs) and phenolics. Recently, an innovative process that employs enzymatic and ultrafiltration processes for recovering and purifying AXs from nejayote was described, although neither the drying methods nor the physicochemical and rheological properties of the recovered AXs by this method at the pilot plant scale have been studied. Nejayote from a batch artisanal process (NBAP) and from a continuous industrial process (NCIP) were compared with a corn-bran-hydrolysate (CBH) as sources for AXs obtention. Freeze drying (FD), spray drying (SD) and solvent drying (SoD) were assessed as processes for drying purified and concentrated AXs solutions. Regardless of the process, AXs obtained from nejayote contain 3 times less (0.30 mg/g) esterified ferulic acid (EFA) than did AXs from corn bran (1.01 mg/g) and thus fail to yield elastic gels upon oxidative cross-linking. Molecular weight distribution (MwD) and dynamic viscosity data show that AXs from nejayote are shorter than AXs from corn bran. In general, the drying method had no effect on the physicochemical and rheological properties of AXs, although additional purification using ethanol precipitation and SoD, eliminated low molecular weight oligosaccharides and residual salts resulting from the neutralization of the corn-lime-cooking-liquor. Spray drying seems to be the most cost-effective unit operation for the industrial production of AXs from nejayote without affecting their physicochemical characteristics.

Synbiotic microcapsules using agavins and inulin as wall materials for Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve: viability, physicochemical properties, and resistance to in vitro oro-gastrointestinal transit.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study was conducted to evaluate the potential of the prebiotics agavins and inulin as wall materials to confer protection to the probiotics Lactobacillus casei and Bifidobacterium breve to produce synbiotic microcapsules by spray drying, besides to evaluate their resistance to the in vitro oro-gastrointestinal transit. Viability and survival were determined for different spray drying conditions. Hygroscopicity, solubility, moisture content, water activity, wettability, morphology, and particle size were analyzed. Synbiotic microcapsules showed a microorganisms concentration 9-10 log CFU/g for L. casei and 10-11 log CFU/g for B. breve, in addition to appropriate physicochemical properties. After the oro-gastrointestinal transit assay, synbiotic microcapsules presented viabilities above 8 log CFU/g. Besides the prebiotics benefits, all the synbiotic microcapsules produced in this study presented a microorganisms concentration higher than required to exert beneficial effects on consumers' health, thus being a good option for further potential applications as functional food ingredients or as dietary adjuncts. Novelty impact statement. Its novelty relies on prebiotic agavins as the only wall material to protect probiotics by spray drying, besides the recent use of agavins in the food industry. Agavins provided higher protection in the in vitro oro-gastrointestinal transit assay than inulin. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of concentrate enriched with palmitic acid versus rapeseed oil on dairy performance, milk fatty acid composition, and mammary lipogenic gene expression in mid-lactation Holstein cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study was performed to characterize the effect of a concentrate supplemented with free palmitic acid (4% on a DM basis; PA) or rapeseed oil (4% on a DM basis; RO) compared with a no-added-lipid control concentrate (CT) on the performance of dairy cows fed a corn silage-based diet over a 9-wk period. After a 3-wk pre-experimental period, 54 Holstein cows were randomly allocated to 3 experimental treatments to receive forage ad libitum with a fixed amount of CT, RO, or PA (8 kg/d for 2-yr-old primiparous; 10 kg/d for older cows). During the experiment, dry matter intake, milk yield and composition, fatty acid (FA) yields and FA profile, and feed efficiency were determined. At wk 9 of the experimental period, the mRNA levels of 10 genes involved in lipid metabolism in mammary tissue biopsy samples were measured. Compared with CT, RO and PA increased forage intake. Compared with CT, RO increased concentrate intake, the value being intermediate for PA. Compared with CT, RO increased milk yield (+2.0 kg/d) and decreased milk fat and protein content (-3.8 and -1.2 g/kg, respectively), whereas PA increased milk fat content (+4.1 g/kg). Compared with CT and RO treatments, PA increased milk fat yield (+179 g/d) and 3.5% fat-corrected milk and energy-corrected milk output (+2.8 and+2.3 kg/d, respectively), and thus improved feed efficiency (+7.3%). Compared with CT treatment, RO increased milk contents of the sum of >C16 FA, monounsaturated FA, polyunsaturated FA, trans FA, and n-3 FA, whereas PA decreased these FA contents (except n-3 FA) and also decreased n-6 FA. The variations in milk fat yield and content and FA secretion at wk 9 were not associated with modifications in mammary expression of 10 genes involved in major lipid pathways, except for the transcription factor PPARG1, which tended to be higher in PA versus RO treatment. This study demonstrated that PA improved milk fat yield and feed efficiency compared with RO and suggests that factors other than gene expression, such as substrate availability for mammary metabolism or other levels of regulation (transcriptional, posttranscriptional, translational or posttranslational), could play a key role in milk fat and FA responses to changes in diet composition in cows.

Effect of Kelulut honey nanoparticles coating on the changes of respiration rate, ascorbic acid, and total phenolic content of papaya (Carica papaya L.) during cold storage.		Foods					This study evaluated the respiration rate of coated and uncoated (control) papayas (Carica papaya L.) with 15% of Kelulut honey (KH) nanoparticles (Nps) coating solution during cold storage at 121 °C for 21 days. The respiration rate of the papayas significantly changed during storage, with an increase in CO2 and a decrease in O2 and C2H4, while the ascorbic acid and total phenolic content was maintained. The changes in respiration rate were rather slower for coated papayas when compared to control ones. A kinetic model was established from the experimental data to describe the changes of O2, CO2, and C2H4 production in papayas throughout the storage period. All O2, CO2, and C2H4 were experimentally retrieved from a closed system method and then represented by the Peleg model. The outcomes indicated the Peleg constant K1 and K2, which were gained from linear regression analysis and coefficients of determination (R2), seemed to fit well with the experimental data, whereby the R2 values exceeded 0.85 for both coated and control papayas. The model confirmed both the capability and predictability aspects of the respiration rate displayed by papayas coated with KH Nps throughout the cold storage period. This is supported by the differences in the stomatal aperture of coated and control papaya shown by microstructural images. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work analyzed the antifungal capacity of different sanitizers allowed in the food industry against species involved in the spoilage of dairy and meat products and compared the results with sanitizing products used in the food industry. Tests were carried out according to the protocol for testing the antifungal effects of chemical sanitizers of the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the French Standard NF-T-72281. Industry data were obtained by electronic form. Aspergillus (A. westerdijkiae, A. pseudoglaucus) and Penicillium (P. commune, P. roqueforti, P. polonicum) were tested against benzalkonium chloride, biguanide, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, and an ortho-phenylphenol-based fumigant. The spoilage fungi isolated from meat products were resistant to most of the sanitizers and concentrations tested. The lowest concentration specified in the product label is the closest to the usually applied in the food industry and was never effective against the spoilage species tested. Peracetic acid was the most common agent employed by the food facilities surveyed and the most effective sanitizer at the highest concentration evaluated, especially against cheese spoilage species. Nevertheless, none of the tested sanitizers are ideal for fungal inactivation at the concentration usually recommended and employed in the food industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of ultrasound on cell viability and storage of dehydrated jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) impregnated with Lactobacillus casei.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work evaluated use of ultrasound on probiotic concentration and storage stability of dehydrated jackfruit impregnated with Lactobacillus casei. Impregnation was performed at atmospheric pressure (AI) or vacuum (VI), and with ultrasound (US+ AI; US+ VI) pretreatment. The impregnated jackfruit was dried at 50 °C and stored in vacuum packaging for 28 days at 4 °C. Ultrasound pretreatment and impregnation resulted in higher moisture content, showing greater capacity for infiltration of the impregnation liquid. Regarding to drying, the control sample (without ultrasound and impregnation) reached the dynamic equilibrium in 220 min, while AI impregnated sample showed a shorter time (64 min). Higher probiotic concentration was found after the US+ AI treatment when compared with the US+ IV (p < 0.05). Regarding the storage study, the US+ AI treatment allowed the product to have a concentration of 7.990.07 log10 CFU/g, and after 28 days, it reduced to 0.75 log10 CFU/g. The impregnation resulted in a microbial content, after drying, in its less effective process, of 6.790.20 log10 CFU/g, a minimum concentration enough to be considered a probiotic product. The impregnation method influenced both drying and probiotic concentration during the process and storage of the product.

Listeria monocytogenes assessment in a ready-to-eat salad shelf-life study using conventional culture-based methods, genetic profiling, and propidium monoazide quantitative PCR.		Foods					Listeriosis is almost entirely transmitted through foods contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Ready-to-eat foods present a particular challenge due to their long refrigerated shelf-life, not requiring any heat treatment before consumption. In this work, a shelf-life assessment of an industrially produced ready-to-eat salad was performed using conventional culture-based and molecular methods. L. monocytogenes isolates were confirmed and serogrouped using multiplex PCR, and genetic subtyping was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PMAxx-qPCR was used as an alternative method for L. monocytogenes quantification in foods. Salad samples were kept at 4 °C, 12 °C, and 16 °C for eight days and analysed. At 4 °C, acceptable results were obtained considering hygiene indicators, i.e., Enterobacteriaceae (ranging from 3.550.15 log cfu/g to 5.390.21 log cfu/g) and aerobic mesophilic colony counts (5.910.90 log cfu/g to 9.410.58 log cfu/g) throughout the study, but the same did not happen at 12 °C and 16 °C. L. monocytogenes culture-based quantification exhibited low numbers (<1 log cfu/g) for all temperatures. From 30 presumptive isolates, 10 (33.3%) were confirmed as L. monocytogenes with the majority belonging to serogroup IVb. PFGE subtyping showed that 7 of the 10 L. monocytogenes isolates had 100% of pulsotype similarity, suggesting a possible common contamination source. PMAxx-qPCR revealed a statistically higher L. monocytogenes quantification (>3 log cfu/g) when compared to the conventional culture-based method, suggesting viable but non-culturable forms. Taken together, results underline the need to combine conventional methods with more sensitive, specific, and rapid ones for L. monocytogenes assessment in ready-to-eat foods shelf-life studies to reduce the potential risk for consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bernas, E.; Jaworska, G.							Onion juice and extracts for the inhibition of enzymatic browning mechanisms in frozen Agaricus bisporus mushrooms.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The potential of onion juice, as well as extracts of waste (tunic) (5%) and fleshy scale leaves (25%), to inhibit enzymatic browning of frozen Agaricus bisporus was investigated. The onion materials were used for blanching and their effectiveness in conserving integrity and appearance of mushroom fruiting bodies was compared with the currently accepted method of blanching in a sodium metabisulfite (SM) solution. Results. It was observed that L-phenylalanine content may be a useful indicator of the changes in enzymatic activity during frozen storage, and L-tyrosine may be an indicator of a loss of lightness in color (parameter L*). The enzymes responsible for color changes were mainly monophenolase (MON) and, to a lesser degree, diphenolase (DIP). After being stored frozen for 8 months, these enzymes were detected at a 29:1 (DIP: MON) ratio in untreated mushrooms and a 2:1 (DIP: MON) ratio in mushrooms treated with onion juice. Conclusion. Onion products may be a good alternative to an SM solution. The most effective method to conserve the light color of fruiting bodies was blanching in juice or in an extract of the fleshy scale leaves. The least effective inhibitor of MON was tunic extract, which did, however, cause a favourable increase in the reducing capacity (total polyphenols) and flavonoids. Although the onion waste (tunic) extract changed the color of mushrooms from white to creamy orange, the color of these products was attractive and positively evaluated by panellists. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Bernhardsons, D.; Hilscher, E.; Narten, H.							KWS BEETROMETER in a commercial application.		International Sugar Journal					Considerable time and research are invested in developing new products, after much trial and error this investment finally paid off with a useable product. We have reported on the work that has been done in developing the BEETROMETER which is an innovative approach to providing quality analysis of whole Sugar beet samples. Current methodology used in analyzing sugar beet quality is over 40 years old. This is a manual process which requires the production of brei and trained technical staff. We have been able to support a sugar company in updating their process with the BEETROMETER with the 2019 harvest. The system has been used in research activities for over 10 years collecting several thousand measurements annually and was introduced in 2019 as a commercial offering. This implementation involved converting an existing sugar company's Quality Lab that utilized analysis of fresh brei using a polarimeter, flame photometer and colorimeter for the analysis of polarized sugar, sodium, potassium and amino nitrogen. Using the results from this analysis, the calculate recoverable sugar using the Carruthers Formula. After two successful seasons it has proven to be a reliable replacement to wet chemistry in the sugar beet Quality Lab with accurate results and the ability to increase throughput and reduce labor requirements. The patented system works well as a retrofit for current labs or as a greenfield project.										2021	123	1469			0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1812

Application of high hydrostatic pressure for the reduction of STEC on raw ground beef patties and its impact on physicochemical properties: pH and color.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study on raw ground beef patties evaluated: resistance of STEC strains inoculated at 6 log CFU/g (O157:H7, O26, O45, O103, O111, O121, and O145) subjected to 350,450 and 600 MPa, for 5 min at 10 °C; effectiveness of pressure for initial loads (2, 3 and 4 log CFU/g) of O157:H7; and general impact of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) on raw patties. For 600 MPa treatments and 6 log CFU/g load of STEC, ~5 log CFU/g reductions were obtained with all strains. For 450 MPa, differences in baroresistance among strains became evident. When inoculating O157:H7 at different loads, counts after 600 MPa fell below quantification limits, though virulence genes were detected for the two highest loads. Additionally, HHP reduced native aerobic microbiota to <1 log CFU/g and slightly affected a* and b* color values. Montecarlo simulation was used to estimate potential initial counts of STEC that allow compliance with existing regulatory limits after applying HHP, showing that absence of STEC studied can be achieved in 65 g of patties provided initial loads are ~2 log CFU/g. Finally, HHP treatments at 600 MPa and mild temperatures can be considered a valid non-thermal processing technology to achieve 5 log CFU/g reductions. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Processing mixed mesopelagic biomass from the North-East Atlantic into aquafeed resources; implication for food safety.		Foods					Aquaculture produces most of the world's seafood and is a valuable food source for an increasing global population. Low trophic mesopelagic biomasses have the potential to sustainably supplement aquafeed demands for increased seafood production. The present study is a theoretical whole-chain feed and food safety assessment on ingredients from mesopelagic biomass and the resulting farmed fish fed these ingredients, based on analysis of processed mesopelagic biomass. Earlier theoretical estimations have indicated that several undesirable compounds (e.g., dioxins and metals and fluoride) would exceed the legal maximum levels for feed and food safety. Our measurements on processed mesopelagic biomasses show that only fluoride exceeds legal feed safety limits. Due to high levels of fluoride in crustaceans, their catch proportion will dictate the fluoride level in the whole biomass and can be highly variable. Processing factors are established that can be used to estimate the levels of undesirables in mesopelagic aquafeed ingredients from highly variable species biomass catches. Levels of most the studied undesirables (dioxins, PCBs, organochlorine pesticides, brominated flame retardant, metals, metalloids) were generally low compared to aquafeed ingredients based on pelagic fish. Using a feed-to-fillet aquaculture transfer model, the use of mesopelagic processed aquafeed ingredients was estimated to reduce the level of dioxins and PCBs by ~30% in farmed seafood such as Atlantic salmon. © 2021 by the authors.

The effect of added oat hulls or sugar beet pulp to diets containing rapidly or slowly digestible protein sources on broiler growth performance from 0 to 36 days of age.		International Sugar Journal					The effects of formulating broiler diets that contain sources of either rapidly or slowly digestible protein and 2 different dietary fiber sources on growth performance were studied in broilers chickens from 0 to 36 d of age. A total of 1,920 one-day-old, male Ross 708 broiler chickens were randomly allocated and housed in 48 floor pens (40 birds/pen) to one of 4 dietary treatments. Birds were allotted according to a completely randomized block design using a factorial arrangement of treatments with 2 protein digestion rates (rapidly or slowly) and 2 dietary fiber sources [3% oat hulls (OH) or 3% sugar beet pulp (SBP)] from 0 to 36 d of age. All diets were formulated to be isocaloric and isonitrogenous. The pen was the experimental unit for all variables studied (12 replicates/ treatment). Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS, and the model included the main effects of the protein digestion rate, dietary fiber source, and their interaction. There were 3 experimental feeding phases; starter (from day 0-14), grower (from day 14-28), and finisher (from day 28-36). Results indicated that broilers fed diets containing sources that supplied more rapidly digestible protein had 4% greater (P< 0.01) ADG and improved (P<0.01) the feed conversion ratio (FCR) by 5% throughout the experiment, most notably after the starter phase. Diets containing 3% OH increased (P< 0.05) the ADFI and ADG (P< 0.05) in the starter phase compared with broilers fed diets containing 3% SBP, without affecting the FCR. The ADG and FCR of broilers fed diets containing sources of slowly digestible protein were improved (P< 0.05) to the level of broilers fed rapidly digestible protein containing diets with the addition of 3% OH. It is concluded that broiler diets should be formulated to contain a high concentration of ingredients that supply rapidly digestible protein, but if this is cost-prohibitive, then 3% OH could be used to increase the ADFI and ADG and potentially protein digestion rates to reduce the FCR.										2021	123	1466			0020-8841				10.1016/j.psj.2020.09.004					FSTA:2021-07-Lc1199

Chemical composition, tocopherol and carotenoid content of seeds from different andean lupin (Lupinus mutabilis) ecotypes.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Andean lupin (Lupinus mutabilis) seeds are appreciated for their high protein and lipid contents and have potential applications as ingredients in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Nevertheless, the information about the seed composition (especially in lipophilic antioxidants) of ecotypes from distinct cropping areas is currently limited. Thus, the aim of the present research was to assess the morphological characteristics, chemical composition, tocopherol and carotenoid contents of the seeds of 33 Andean lupin ecotypes from different Peruvian regions, along with three L. albus, one L. angustifolius and one L. luteus controls. Significant differences were noted among the Andean ecotypes for all analyzed features. The protein, lipid and ash contents were 32.0-46.9,13.6-18.6 and 2.7-4.4 g/100 g dry matter (DM), respectively. The seeds were rich in tocopherols (172.1-249.8 mg/kg DM; gamma-tocopherol was 98% of total tocols) and low in carotenoids (0.69-2.89 mg/kg DM). Debittering increased the tocopherol content (227.0-378.2 mg/kg DM), probably because of the soluble components loss, although the carotenoid concentration remained unchanged. The Andean lupins had higher protein, lipid and tocopherol contents than L. albus and L. angustifolius; the L. luteus values were within the L. mutabilis range. These results suggest that L. mutabilis harbors nutritional characteristics that are well suited to modern food trends. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Berry, C.; Romero, M.							The fair trade food labeling health halo: effects of fair trade labeling on consumption and perceived healthfulness.		Food Quality and Preference					The purpose of fair trade certification is to assure consumers that products support responsible companies, empower farmers, workers, and fisherman, and protect the environment. Yet, could it be possible that consumers infer greater healthfulness of foods containing such labels, and subsequently increase their consumption of fair trade certified foods? Across three studies, we demonstrate that fair trade labels can increase consumption by 26% to 31%. In study 1, we demonstrate that individuals consume more if the food product contains a fair trade label. In the subsequent studies we home in on the underlying process, demonstrating that the effect is mediated by the product's perceived healthfulness (study 2 and 3) To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study that (1) tests the effects of fair trade labels from third-party certifiers in package-based experiments, (2) examines the effects of fair trade labels on consumption, and (3) directly tests an overall health halo-perceived healthfulness-as the underlying process. In doing so, this research contributes to the values-based labeling and health halo literatures, while offering implications for public policy makers, consumers, and food marketers.

J		Berry, D. P.; Evans, R. D.; Kelleher, M. M.							Prediction of genetic merit for live weight and body condition score in dairy cows using routinely available linear type and carcass data.		Journal of Dairy Science					Accurate estimates of genetic merit for both live weight and body condition score (BCS) could be useful additions to both national-and herd-breeding programs. Although recording live weight and BCS is not technologically arduous, data available for use in routine genetic evaluations are generally lacking. The objective of the present study was to explore the usefulness of routinely recorded data, namely linear type traits (which also included BCS but only assessed visually) and carcass traits in the pursuit of genetic evaluations for both live weight and BCS in dairy cows. The data consisted of on-farm records of live weight and BCS (assessed using both visual and tactile cues) from 33, 242 dairy cows in 201 commercial Irish herds. These data were complemented with information on 6 body-related linear type traits (i.e., stature, angularity, chest width, body depth, BCS, and rump width) and 3 cull cow carcass measures (i.e., carcass weight, conformation, and fat cover) on a selection of these animals plus close relatives. (Co) variance components were estimated using animal linear mixed models. The genetic correlation between the type traits stature, angularity, body depth, chest width, rump width, and visually-assessed BCS with live weight was 0.68, -0.28, 0.43, 0.64, 0.61, and 0.44, respectively. The genetic correlation between angularity and BCS measured on farm (based on both visual and tactile appraisal) was -0.79; the genetic and phenotypic correlation between BCS assessed visually as part of the linear assessment with BCS assessed by producers using both tactile and visual cues was 0.90 and 0.27, respectively. The genetic (phenotypic) correlation between cull cow carcass weight and live weight was 0.81 (0.21), and the genetic (phenotypic) correlation between cull cow carcass fat cover and BCS assessed on live cows was 0.44 (0.12). Estimated breeding values (EBV) for live weight and BCS in a validation population of cows were generated using a multitrait evaluation with observations for just the type traits, just the carcass traits, and both the type traits and carcass traits; the EBV were compared with the respective live weight and BCS phenotypic observations. The regression of phenotypic live weight on its EBV from the multitrait evaluations was 1.00 (i.e., the expectation) when the EBV was generated using just linear type trait data, but less than 1 (0.83) when using just carcass data. However, the regression changed across parities and stages of lactation. The partial correlation (after adjusting for contemporary group, parity by stage of lactation, heterosis, and recombination loss) between phenotypic live weight and EBV for live weight estimated using the 3 different scenarios (i.e., type only, carcass only, type plus carcass) ranged from 0.38 to 0.43. Although the prediction of phenotypic BCS from its respective EBV was relatively good when using just the linear type trait data (regression coefficient of 0.83 with a partial correlation of 0.22), the predictive ability of BCS EBV based on just carcass data was poor and should not be used. Overall, linear type trait data are a useful source of information to predict live weight and BCS with minimal additional predictive value from also including carcass data. Nonetheless, in the absence of linear type trait data, information on carcass traits can be useful in predicting genetic merit for mature cow live weight. Prediction of cow BCS from cow carcass data is not recommended. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Berry, D. P.; McCarthy, J.							Contribution of genetic variability to phenotypic differences in on-farm efficiency metrics of dairy cows based on body weight and milk solids yield.		Journal of Dairy Science					Milk solids per kilogram of body weight (BW) is growing in popularity as a measure of dairy cow lactation efficiency. Little is known on the extent of genetic variability that exist in this trait but also the direction and strength of genetic correlations with other performance traits. Such genetic correlations are important to know if producers are to consider actively selecting cows excelling in milk solids per kilogram of BW. The objective of the present study was to use a large data set of commercial Irish dairy cows to quantify the extent of genetic variability in milk solids per kilogram of BW and related traits but also their genetic and phenotypic inter-relationships. Mid-lactation BW and body condition score (BCS), along with 305-d milk solids yield (i.e., fat plus protein yield) were available on 12,413 lactations from 11,062 cows in 85 different commercial dairy herds. (Co)variance components were estimated using repeatability animal linear mixed models. The genetic correlation between milk solids and body weight was only 0.05, which when coupled with the observed large genetic variability in both traits, indicate massive potential to select for both traits in opposite directions. The genetic correlations between both milk solids and BW with BCS; however, need to be considered in any breeding strategy. The genetic standard deviation, heritability, and repeatability of milk solids per kilogram of BW was 0.08, 0.37, and 0.57, respectively. The genetic correlation between milk solids per kilogram of BW with milk solids, BW, and BCS was 0.62, -0.75, and -0.41, respectively. Therefore, based on genetic regression, each increase of 0.10 units in genetic merit for milk solids per kilogram of BW is expected to result in, on average, an increase in 16.1 kg 305-d milk solids yield, a reduction of 25.6 kg of BW and a reduction of 0.05 BCS units (scale of 1-5 where 1 is emaciated). The genetic standard deviation (heritability) for 305-d milk solids yield adjusted phenotypically to a common BW was 27.3 kg (0.22). The genetic correlation between this adjusted milk solids trait with milk solids, BW, and BCS was 0.91, -0.12, and -0.26, respectively. Once also adjusted phenotypically to a common BCS, the genetic standard deviation (heritability) for milk solids adjusted phenotypically to a common BW was 26.8 kg (0.22) where the genetic correlation with milk solids, BW and BCS was 0.91, -0.21, and -0.07, respectively. The genetic standard deviation (heritability) of BW adjusted phenotypically for differences in milk solids was 35.3 kg (0.61), which reduced to 33.2 kg when also phenotypically adjusted for differences in BCS. Results suggest considerable opportunity exists to change milk solids yield independent of BW, and vice versa. The opportunity is reduced slightly once also corrected for differences in BCS. Inter-animal BCS differences should be considered if selection on such metrics is contemplated. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Meat Science					The objective of the present study was to estimate genetic parameters for four organoleptic traits in beef meat, namely tenderness, juiciness, flavour and chewiness using data from 5380 young crossbred progeny of 748 different sires. As well as using the mean animal sensory score across all panellists for a given trait, other aggregate functions such As the median and modal values were also investigated. The heritability (SE) of mean tenderness, juiciness, flavour and chewiness was 0.16 (0.04), 0.14 (0.04), 0.11 (0.03) and 0.21 (0.06), respectively; heritability estimates for the other aggregate values of these traits were generally lower. All genetic correlations between tenderness, juiciness and flavour were positive (0.52 to 0.68) while the genetic correlations between these three traits with chewiness were all negative varying from -0.95 to -0.48. Weak genetic correlations (≤|0.16|) were evident between the sensory traits and all of carcass weight, conformation and subcutaneous fat cover. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Assessment of a new edible film biodegradable based on starch-nystose to increase quality and the shelf life of blackberries.		Food Bioscience					Biodegradable edible films have been studied, because increase the shelf life of different foods that are highly perishable and, in addition, they carry on other compounds that improve their mechanical properties coating and add value to the final product. Therefore, in this study, was evaluated the effect of an edible prebiotic coating of starch with the addition of nystose, with the objective to preserve the quality and increase the useful life of blackberries stored at 4 °C for 20 days. Control fruits and those coated only with starch showed higher counts for psychrotrophic microorganisms and molds and yeasts after 7 days and fruits with starch-nystose coating contamination was reduced with counts recommended for consumption. The starch and starch-nystose coatings were effective in delaying the increase in pH, maintaining the firmness and anthocyanin content of the fruits. The sensory evaluation showed that the fruits coated with the starch-nystose film obtained good acceptance and purchase intention, without significant differences with the control fruit. These results are promising, the biodegradable starch coating with the addition of nystose proved to efficient, preserving the quality of blackberry, and can be an innovative alternative to prolong the useful life of the fruits.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Biopolymer based active films can present several types of activity, such as the antioxidant activity. It can be produced by adding plant extract, usually rich in phenolic compounds, in its formulation. Boldo is a plant not studied as raw material in active film technology. The aims of this study were to evaluate the antioxidant activity (AA) of the boldo leaf's hydroethanolic extracts (BLHE) produced with solvents at different water: ethanol ratios and to study the effect of their addition on properties of gelatin-based films. Solvents prepared with 0:100-100:0 water: ethanol ratios were used to produce BLHE, which were analyzed for AA, color, pH and total phenolic content. Gelatin-based films were produced with 0-50-150g BLHE/100g gelatin. The BLHE produced using pure water presented a yellowish-red aspect; while using pure ethanol, it presented a greenish-yellow aspect. The pH varied between 5.1-5.7. The BLHE produced using pure ethanol had 3.6 mg Gallic acid/mL extract, but this value increased to 7.3 mg Gallic acid/mL extract for BLHE produced with 100:0. The AA of BLHE was not affected by the water: ethanol ratio. The addition of BLHE into film did not affect its main properties. The BLHE did however affect the film color and UV/visible light barrier properties. DeltaE* was higher when 150% of BLHE produced with more ethanol into solvent was applied into films. All films presented high barrier to UV and moderate barrier to visible light. All films with 150% of BLHE presented good AA. This material looks interesting to be applied as package of fat rich foods. Novelty impact statement. Active films were produced by addition of Boldo leaf's hydroethanolic extracts (BLHE) in its formulations. Several BHLE were produced using solvents prepared with 0:100-100:0 water: ethanol ratios. All films presented antioxidant activity and complete UV light barrier without effect of solvents used to produce BLHE. Nevertheless, the visible light barrier was higher when high proportion of ethanol into solvent was used to produce BLHE. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

European Food Research and Technology					Lentinus crinitus is a wild fungus, which produces mushrooms consumed by some Amazonian Indians. Besides, it is recognized for its diverse biological activities and biotechnological applications. However, there are few reports with limited information on basidiocarp chemical composition and cytotoxicity. Our study determined and evaluated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity, and antioxidant activity of L. crinitus pileus and stipe separately. Chromatographic methods were used to evaluate basidiocarp chemical composition. Cytotoxicity was verified using a cell culture from porcine liver and against a panel of human tumor cells from different models. Antioxidant activity was assessed by different in vitro methods. The pileus had higher levels of protein, ash, tocopherols, and organic acids, mainly malic acid, than the stipe. The stipe revealed higher contents of carbohydrates, energy, soluble sugars, and phenolic acids, mostly p-hydroxybenzoic acid. L. crinitus basidiocarp has mainly trehalose as soluble sugar, and less than 1% fat being ~60% polyunsaturated fatty acids (mostly linoleic and oleic acids), and ~13% saturated fatty acids (mostly palmitic acid). L. crinitus revealed high antioxidant activity for most methods and no cytotoxic activity against tumor and non-tumor cells. L. crinitus basidiocarp can be considered a functional food with applicability in food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Antimicrobial activity, chemical composition and cytotoxicity of Lentinus crinitus basidiocarp.		Food & Function					Lentinus crinitus (L.) Fr. (Basidiomycota: Polyporales) is a wild mushroom with several biotechnological applications; however, there are few studies on its chemical composition and antimicrobial activity. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the chemical composition, cytotoxicity, and antimicrobial activity of L. crinitus basidiocarp. For that, its nutritional value (AOAC procedures) and its composition in some hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds (chromatographic techniques) were assessed. Moreover, the potential hepatotoxic effects were evaluated using a primary cell culture obtained from porcine liver, and its growth inhibitory capacity was also evaluated against four human tumour cell lines (spectrophotometric assays). The antimicrobial activity was evaluated by microdilution against eight bacteria and fungi. The basidiocarp has a high content of carbohydrates and, therefore, a relatively high energetic value. It is also rich in soluble sugars, beta-tocopherol, phenolic acids, mainly p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and organic acids, mainly malic acid. L. crinitus did not show cytotoxicity in non-tumour cells, but it did not inhibit the growth of human tumour cell lines either. The basidiocarp has a wide antimicrobial activity, inhibiting the growth of different species of bacteria and fungi. It showed minimum bactericidal and fungicidal concentration values similar to or lower than those verified by commercial antibiotics or food additives used as preservatives. The antimicrobial activity was more evident against Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, and Penicillium ochrochloron, followed by Aspergillus ochraceus and Trichoderma viride, when compared to the controls. The results obtained in this study showed that L. crinitus basidiocarp has great potential to be used by the industry without toxicity risks. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Bertelsen, A. S.; Yan Zeng; Mielby, L. A.; Sun, Y. X.; Byrne, D. V.; Kidmose, U.							Cross-modal effect of vanilla aroma on sweetness of different sweeteners among Chinese and Danish consumers.		Food Quality and Preference					Non-nutritive sweeteners often contain off-flavors, and the use of aroma to increase sweetness intensity only allows for a small reduction of the sugar content in products. Therefore, it has been suggested to combine different strategies in order to successfully reduce sugar content in foods and beverages. Additionally, the use of aroma to increase sweetness might dependent on culture. The effect of sweetener and nationality on the cross-modal effect of vanilla aroma on sweet taste intensity was therefore investigated. Three sets of sweeteners: sucrose, sucrose + tagatose, and tagatose + rebaudioside A (all iso-sweet with 2.5% sucrose) were investigated with and without vanilla aroma. Cross-modal effects were investigated with both a descriptive sensory analysis as well as consumer studies in China (n=159) and Denmark (n=161). Results indicated the greatest cross-modal effect of vanilla aroma on sweetness intensity of the sweeteners most perceptually similar to sucrose. In both countries, consumers rated samples with added vanilla aroma higher in sweet taste intensity than samples without added aroma. Danish consumers noted a greater increase than Chinese consumers did. Furthermore, individual differences in consumers' sweetness ratings were observed, which could not be completely explained by the consumer characteristics recorded. Results from the present study suggest that the use of vanilla aroma in combination with non-or low-calorie sweeteners for sugar reduction can be used for at least some consumers and some sweeteners.

J		Berti, S.; Jagus, R. J.; Flores, S. K.							Effect of rice bran addition on physical properties of antimicrobial biocomposite films based on starch.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The increase in consumer requirements for safe and high-quality food has promoted the development of active and edible packaging materials based on biopolymers. In this study, composite tapioca starch films by addition of processed rice bran (PRB) microparticles, containing or not the natural antimicrobials natamycin and nisin, were studied in relation to their physicochemical properties and antimicrobial activity. It was observed that the presence of PRB addition (0.1-0.3% w/w) increased yellowness proportionally to fiber content in films with or without antimicrobials but did not influence on thickness and water vapor permeability. Films with 0.2% PRB allowed the highest increase of tensile strength and strain at break and reduced the solubility in water, showing the optimal compatibility between PRB and starch matrix containing or not antimicrobials. Analysis by FTIR also suggested a good compatibility between filler and matrix through hydrophilic groups. Additionally, the analyzed composite films allowed the diffusion of the natural preservatives verified through zones of inhibition formed in the halo test against Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Listeria innocua. Consequently, the developed biocomposites can be used as an active packaging for food preservation. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Berton, J. K. E. T.; Verbeke, Y.; Durme, B. van; Huvaere, K.							Radical intermediates in the degradation of hop acids.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Radical formation in isohumulones was investigated under different types of stress, including temperature, transition metal ions, and hydrogen peroxide. Including dihydroisohumulones and tetrahydroisohumulones, as relevant analogues, allowed us to evaluate critical functionalities in radical formation. Using spin-trapping methodology with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide and N-tert-butyl-alpha-phenylnitrone as relevant traps, followed by simulation of corresponding spin adducts, identification of incipient radicals was attempted. The isohexenoyl side chain in isohumulones, but not present in dihydro-and tetrahydroisohumulones, was most sensitive to radical formation. Kinetic profiles further demonstrated that radical formation in this moiety was accelerated in the presence of ferrous ions. Reactivity of parent six-membered-ring humulones in radical formation was different, as scavenging of free radical species was more important. Lupulones, despite similarity with humulones, showed a different behavior with an obvious radical decay pathway during ageing, mainly ascribed to radical formation on the ring structure. Quantification of final spin adducts allowed us to determine absolute importance of the different degradation pathways. Eventually, mechanisms are presented explaining why isohumulones are more prone to radical processes in (aut) oxidation and thermal decay than close relatives such as dihydroisohumulones.										2021	69	33	9642	9653	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02977					FSTA:2022-01-Hc0302
J		Bertsch, P.; Etter, D.; Fischer, P.							Transient in situ measurement of kombucha biofilm growth and mechanical properties.		Food & Function					Kombucha is a traditional beverage obtained by the fermentation of sugared tea by a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast which has recently re-emerged as a popular lifestyle product with potential health benefits. The characteristic feature of kombucha is the formation of a cellulosic biofilm due to the excretion of bacterial cellulose with high purity and crystallinity. Despite the growing industrial and technological interest in kombucha, current characterization techniques rely on the periodic sampling of tea broth or biofilm and ex situ analysis of its biochemical or microbial composition. Here, we use interfacial shear rheology (ISR) for the transient in situ determination of kombucha biofilm growth directly at the interface. ISR revealed that kombucha biofilm formation is a two step process with clearly distinguishable growth phases. The first phase can be attributed to the initial adsorption of bacteria at the air-water interface and shows great variability, probably due to varying bacteria content and composition. The second phase is initiated by bacterial cellulose excretion and shows astonishing reproducibility regarding onset and final mechanical properties. Hence, ISR qualifies as a new in situ characterization technique for kombucha biofilm growth and bacterial cellulose production. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Bertuso, P. de C.; Mayer, D. M. D.; Nitschke, M.							Combining celery oleoresin, limonene and rhamnolipid as new strategy to control endospore-forming Bacillus cereus.		Foods					Foodborne diseases (FBD) are a great problem worldwide, leading millions of people to seek medical help and to significant economic losses for industry. Among the agents implicated in FDB is Bacillus cereus, a Gram-positive, toxigenic and endospore-forming bacterium. In this study, rhamnolipid (RL) biosurfactant, celery oleoresin (OR) and limonene (LN) were evaluated as bio-based alternatives for controlling the growth of vegetative cells and endospores of B. cereus. To address their antimicrobial activity, the compounds were tested separately and in combination. Results demonstrate that, when combined with RL, both OR and LN have lower minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values and increased endospore inhibition potential. A percentage of endospore inhibition from 73% to 98%, corresponding to a 2.8-3.6 log reduction in spore outgrowth, was observed. RL inhibited B. cereus growth and endospore germination and potentially enhanced the antimicrobial efficacy of the natural hydrophobic compounds tested. © 2021 by the authors.

Field monitoring of aflatoxins in feed and milk of high-yielding dairy cows under two feeding systems.		Toxins					Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is a hydroxylated metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) that can be excreted in milk of cows after consuming contaminated feed. The aim of this study consisted of a field monitoring to assess the contamination levels of AFB1 in 60 feed samples from two feeding systems for high-yielding dairy cows and of AFM1 in the corresponding raw milk samples. The aflatoxins were analyzed by in-house validated methods based on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection. AFB1 was detected in 55% of feed samples (mean 0.61 mug/kg, with 2 samples exceeding the European Union (EU) maximum level set at 5 mug/kg), with greater incidence and concentration in compound feed than in unifeed rations (p< 0.05). AFM1 was detected in 38.3% milk samples (mean 12.6 ng/kg, with 5 samples exceeding the EU maximum level set at 50 ng/kg), with a higher occurrence in milk of cows fed compound feed, as well as in spring milk compared to that produced in winter. The overall transfer ratio of aflatoxins from feed to milk was 3.22%, being higher in cows fed with compound feed and in spring milkings. In a selection of positive matched samples (n=22), the ratio AFM1/AFB1 exceeded the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) estimated 6% threshold for high-yielding dairy cows. © 2021 by the authors.

A novel spectrophotometric method based on Seliwanoff test to determine 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (HMF) in honey: development, in house validation and application.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A new spectrophotometric method for the determination of 5-(Hydroxymethyl) furfural (5-HMF) in honey was proposed. In the proposed method based on the qualitative Seliwanoff test, quantitative determination was carried out by measuring the red color formed by reacting the HMF and Seliwanoff reagent (resorcinol-HCl). Central Composite Design (CCD) was used to obtain optimum reaction parameters. The limit of detection, LOD (2.69 mg kg-1) and limit of quantification, LOQ (8.97 mg kg-1) were established in the model honey matrix. Precision (as RSD for inter and intraday precision) was in the range of 2.52-5.14%. Accuracy results obtained exhibit a good recovery (from 95.83% to 96.65%). Good selectivity and linearity (R2> 0.99) were also observed. HMF amounts in honey samples determined by the proposed method were found to be in a relatively good agreement with those obtained by the spectrophotometric Winkler method (r=0.9880) and HPLC-UV method (r=0.9888).

Aerococcus sp., a promising genus as a source of anti-Salmonella bioprotective agents for the dairy industry revealed by a miniaturised screening method.		International Dairy Journal					Biopreservation is a promising technology for insuring safety of food. This study evaluated the anti-Salmonella potential of 1450 dairy isolates from 54 genera, in conditions mimicking dairy matrices, to find new bioprotective strains. Among the screened isolates, 6.4% exhibited an antagonistic activity towards at least one of the two Salmonella Mbandaka and Montevideo reference strains. Lactococcus sp. generated the highest number of bioprotective candidates, followed by Aerococcus sp. from which seven isolates were able to inhibit at least 80% of 20 Salmonella strains in milk medium and/or cheese medium. Inhibition by Aerococcus sp. was characterised by the production of hydrogen peroxide (30-100 mg L-1) and acetic acid (0.23-0.34 g L-1). Aerococcus sp . appears to be a new promising source of bioprotective agents against Salmonella in dairy matrices, along with the well-described Lactococcus genus. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food safety of consuming black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae: microbial, heavy metal and cross-reactive allergen risks.		Foods					Black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) larvae (BSFL) are a promising, sustainable source of nutrients, however, there is limited knowledge regarding the food safety of consuming BSFL. This study determined the safety of consuming BSFL for direct human consumption in terms of microbial, heavy metal and allergen content. Microbial counts were determined using ISO (International Organization for Standardization) methods, heavy metals were determined using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and allergens were determined via Orbitrap mass spectrometry and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) kits. Feed and killing method influenced the presence of Bacillus cereus (p = 0.011), and only the killing method influenced Escherichia coli (p< 0.00) and total viable count (TVC) (p< 0.00). Blanching resulted in a 3-log reduction in E. coli and a 3.4 log reduction in the TVC counts. Salmonella spp. and Listeria spp. were not detected in the BSFL samples. Heavy metals were detected although they were below maximum legal limits. Cross-reactive allergens, tropomyosin and arginine kinase, were detected in the BSFL samples, although the clinical significance requires research. The feed fed to the BSFL and blanching were found to influence the safety of consuming BSFL, highlighting the importance of incorporating sufficient decontamination steps, such as blanching, to ensure food safety. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bessaire, T.; Ernest, M.; Christinat, N.; Carreres, B.; Panchaud, A.; Badoud, F.							High resolution mass spectrometry workflow for the analysis of food contaminants: application to plant toxins, mycotoxins and phytoestrogens in plant-based ingredients.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					An analytical workflow including mass spectral library, generic sample preparation, chromatographic separation, and analysis by high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was developed to gain insight into the occurrence of plant toxins, mycotoxins and phytoestrogens in plant-based food. This workflow was applied to 156 compounds including 90 plant toxins (pyrrolizidine alkaloids, tropane alkaloids, glycoalkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids and aristolochic acids), 54 mycotoxins (including ergot alkaloids and Alternaria toxins) and 12 phytoestrogens (including isoflavones, lignans and coumestan) in plant-based protein ingredients, cereal and pseudo-cereal products. A mass spectral library was built based on fragmentation spectra collected at 10 different collision energies in both positive and negative ionisation modes for each toxin. Emphasis was put on a generic QuEChERS-like sample preparation followed by ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography using alkaline mobile phase allowing the separation of more than 50 toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids. HRMS acquisition comprised a full-scan event for toxins detection followed by data-dependent MS2 for toxin identification against mass spectrum. Method performance was evaluated using fortified samples in terms of sensitivity, repeatability, reproducibility and recovery. All toxins were positively identified at levels ranging from 1 g kg-1 to 100 g kg-1. Quantitative results obtained by a standard addition approach met SANTE/12682/2019 criteria for 132 out of 156 toxins. Such a workflow using generic, sensitive and selective multi-residue method allows a better insight into the occurrence of regulated and non-regulated toxins in plant-based foods and to conduct safety evaluation and risk assessments when needed. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Analysis of ethylene oxide in ice creams manufactured with contaminated carob bean gum (E410).		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Residues of ethylene oxide (EO), a banned fumigant in the EU, were found at amounts above the maximum residue limit (MRL) in carob (locust) bean gum (additive E410). The pesticide entered the food chain via stabiliser blends that are used as minor ingredients in the manufacture of ice cream. Consequently, all products that contained the non-compliant ingredient were withdrawn or recalled in several countries across the EU, in most cases irrespective of whether the pesticide residue was detectable or not in the final product. This is the first report of a reliable method to determine EO and its metabolite/marker compound 2-chloroethanol (2-CE), either together or independently in ice cream, with a limit of quantification at 0.01 mg EO/kg and recovery in the range of 87-104% across the levels investigated (0.01, 0.02 and 0.06 mg EO/kg). The method applies QuEChERS extraction and isotope dilution gas chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS). High resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) confirmed the specificity of low mass ions. Data on the stability of EO and 2-CE under thermal conditions revealed that 2-CE is relatively stable in an ice cream matrix (ca. 80% recovery of spiked material). Importantly, this study also demonstrates that not EO, but 2-CE is the predominant analyte detected in the contaminated samples, which is new information of significance in terms of the overall risk assessment of EO in foodstuffs. © 2021 The Author(s).

J		Betnga, P. F. T.; Longo, E.; Merkyte, V.; Matos, A. D. de; Rossetti, F.; Boselli, E.							Effects of long-term bottle storage on red and rose wines sealed with different types of closures.		Foods					Volatile and non-volatile chemical profiles, free and total SO2 and dissolved oxygen content were studied in three red (Merlot, Lagrein red, St. Magdalener) and one rose (Lagrein rose) wine after 30 months of storage in bottles. Each wine was sealed with closures made of a "blend" (B) of natural cork microgranules and polymers without glue and was compared with wines closed with other types of corks (C; a technical cork 1 + 1, or an agglomerated natural cork or a natural one-piece cork). Glutathionyl caftaric acid (GRP) was inversely correlated with total SO2 content and was higher in all three red wines closed with B compared to C, whereas epicatechin was higher in three wines closed with C compared to B. Three volatile compounds formed by fermentation (ethyl butanoate, isoamyl lactate, and octanol) were inversely correlated with both free and total SO2. In terms of their volatile profiles, ethyl octanoate and 2,3-butanediol were significantly higher in the Lagrein red wines closed with C closures, whereas no significant difference was observed in Merlot, Lagrein rose and St. Magdalener wines. Small differences in some phenolic compounds due to the type of closure were found: GRP, syringic acid, (+)-catechin, and (-)-epicatechin differentiated the Merlot wines closed with B from the C closures. Protocatechuic acid and GRP levels differentiated the Lagrein red wines according to their closure type, whereas only (-)-epicatechin differentiated the Lagrein rose wines. GRP, caffeic acid, (-)-epicatechin, and anthocyanin content differentiated the St. Magdalener wines according to their closure type. Even though St. Magdalener and Lagrein rose closed with C could be distinguished from those closed with B by using the (sensory) triangle test (alpha = 0.05), these differences appeared to be relative as it did not include all the wines in a systematic manner. © 2021 by the authors.

Gold nanoparticles modified graphene platforms for highly sensitive electrochemical detection of vitamin C in infant food and formulae.		Food Chemistry					An easy and reliable method based on a novel electroanalytical nanostructured sensor has been developed to perform quantification of vitamin C in commercial and fortified cow-milk-based formulae and foods for infants and young children. The work is motivated by the need of a reliable analytical tool to be applied in quality control laboratories for the quantitative assessment of vitamin C where its rapid and cost-effective monitoring is essential. The ad hoc designed sensor, based on disposable screen-printed carbon electrodes modified with Au nanoparticles decorated reduced graphene oxide flakes, exhibits a LOD of 0.088 mg L-1. The low cost, easy sample preparation, fast response and high reproducibility (RSD8%) of the proposed method highlight its suitability for usage in quality control laboratories for determining vitamin C in real complex food matrices, envisaging the application of the sensing platform in the determination of other compounds relevant in food chemistry and food manufacturing.

J		Bettenhausen, H. M.; Barr, L.; Omerigic, H.; Linxing Yao; Heuberger, A. L.							Mass spectrometry metabolomics of hot steep malt extracts and association to sensory traits.		Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists					In the brewing industry, there is value in defining sensory attributes of malt, and recent protocols have been developed that enable analysis of aroma and taste. One method, the "hot steep," is a hot water extract that is highly reproducible and able to distinguish malt flavor. However, the chemistry of the hot steep extracts has not been fully defined, and the links between specific metabolites of the hot steep and their resulting sensory attributes remains largely unknown. Here, a study was designed to describe the metabolite chemistry of hot steep extracts, and to characterize variation in this chemistry and corresponding sensory by comparative analysis of 12 commercial pale malts. Metabolomics was performed on the 12 malt hot steep extracts using three mass spectrometry platforms to detect volatiles (HS/SPME-GC-MS) and non-volatiles (UHPLC-TOF-MS and GC-MS). The analysis detected a total of 1,026 compounds including lipids, organic acids, esters, and Maillard Reaction Products (MRPs), of which 162 compounds (15.7%) varied among the 12 hot steep extracts. Sensory of the 12 hot steep extracts was performed using an integrated Check All That Apply and quantitative analysis method for 14 traits, and the data revealed cereal, grassy, and dough aromas were the attributes that varied. The metabolomics and sensory data were integrated using OPLS analysis. The analysis revealed 64 compounds strongly associated with cereal aroma and included MRPs. A total of 23 compounds were strongly associated with grassy aroma including alkane/alkenes, benzenoids, organic acids, lipids, and fatty acid esters. Taken together, these data highlight the utility of the hot steep extract to differentiate malt for flavor and chemistry and indicate specific compounds that drive the most dominant flavors observed in this population of pale malts. © 2021 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.										2021	79	4	394	406	0361-0470				10.1080/03610470.2020.1869499					FSTA:2022-01-Hc0722

Food & Function					Scope. C. rodentium is the murine equivalent of Enteropathogenic Escherichia. coli (EPEC) and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) which induce damage to the intestinal epithelial barrier that results in diarrhea and intestinal inflammation. Dietary fibre intake can be an effective approach to limit epithelial damage by these enteric pathogens. Therefore, the protective effect of dietary fibre pectin against dysfunction of epithelial barrier integrity upon C. rodentium infection was investigated. Methods and results. Pectins that structurally differed in the degree and distribution of methylesters were tested on barrier protective effects on epithelial cells against C. rodentium by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance and lucifer yellow fluxes. All three pectins protected the epithelial barrier from C. rodentium induced damage in a structure-independent manner. These barrier protective effects were also independent of pectin-induced TLR2 activation. Furthermore, the pectins induced anti-adhesive effects on C. rodentium by interacting with C. rodentium and not with epithelial cells. This may be explained by antimicrobial effects of pectins on C. rodentium and not on other enteric bacteria including Lactobacillus plantarum and E. coli. A competition ELISA for binding of C. rodentium to pectin supported this finding as it showed that pectin interacts strongly with C. rodentium, whereas it interacts weakly or not with L. plantarum or E. coli. Conclusion. These findings demonstrate that pectin protects the epithelial barrier from C. rodentium induced damage by inducing anti-microbial effects. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Attenuation of doxorubicin-induced small intestinal mucositis by pectins is dependent on pectin's methyl-ester number and distribution.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Intestinal mucositis is a common side effect of the chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin, which is characterized by severe Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2-mediated inflammation. The dietary fiber pectin is shown to prevent this intestinal inflammation through direct inhibition of TLR2 in a microbiota-independent manner. Recent in vitro studies show that inhibition of TLR2 is determined by the number and distribution of methyl-esters of pectins. Therefore, it is hypothesized that the degree of methyl-esterification (DM) and the degree of blockiness (DB) of pectins determine attenuating efficacy on doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis. Methods and Results. Four structurally different pectins that differed in DM and DB are tested on inhibitory effects on murine TLR2 in vitro, and on doxorubicin-induced intestinal mucositis in mice. These data demonstrate that low DM pectins or intermediate DM pectins with high DB have the strongest inhibitory impact on murine TLR2-1 and the strongest attenuating effect on TLR2-induced apoptosis and peritonitis. Intermediate DM pectin with a low DB is, however, also effective in preventing the induction of doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage. Conclusion. These pectin structures with stronger TLR2-inhibiting properties may prevent the development of doxorubicin-induced intestinal damage in patients undergoing chemotherapeutic treatment with doxorubicin. © 2021 The Authors.

Pectins that structurally differ in the distribution of methyl-esters attenuate Citrobacter rodentium-induced colitis.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Introduction. Pectins have anti-inflammatory properties on intestinal immunity through direct interactions on Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the small intestine or via stimulating microbiota-dependent effects in the large intestine. Both the degree of methyl-esterification (DM) and the distribution of methyl-esters (degree of blockiness; DB) of pectins contribute to this influence on immunity, but whether and how the DB impacts immunity through microbiota-dependent effects in the large intestine is unknown. Therefore, this study tests pectins that structurally differ in DB in a mouse model with Citrobacter rodentium induced colitis and studies the impact on the intestinal microbiota composition and associated attenuation of inflammation. Methods and Results. Both low and high DB pectins induce a more rich and diverse microbiota composition. These pectins also lower the bacterial load of C. rodentium in cecal digesta. Through these effects, both low and high DB pectins attenuate C. rodentium induced colitis resulting in reduced intestinal damage, reduced numbers of Th1-cells, which are increased in case of C. rodentium induced colitis, and reduced levels of GATA3+ Tregs, which are related to tissue inflammation. Conclusion. Pectins prevent C. rodentium induced colonic inflammation by lowering the C. rodentium load in the caecum independently of the DB. © 2021 The Authors.

Optimizing the immobilization conditions of beta-galactosidase on UV-cured epoxy-based polymeric film using response surface methodology.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					UV-cured epoxy-based polymeric film was prepared from glycidyl methacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, and poly (ethylene glycol) methylether acrylate. 2-hydroxy-2-methylpropiophenone was used as photo initiator. Covalent binding through epoxy groups was employed to immobilize beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli onto this film, and immobilization conditions were optimized by the response surface methodology. ATR-Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was carried out to characterize the epoxy-based polymeric film. Immobilization yield of beta-galactosidase on the material was calculated as 3.57 mg/g and the highest enzyme activity for the immobilized enzyme recorded at pH 6.5 °C and 60 °C. The immobilized enzyme preserved 51% of its activity at the end of 12 runs. Free and immobilized enzyme hydrolyzed 163.8 and 172.3 M lactose from 1% lactose, respectively. Kinetic parameters of both free and immobilized beta-galactosidase were also investigated, and Km values were determined to be 0.647 and 0.7263 mM, respectively. Practical applications. In our study we prepared a UV-cured epoxy-based polymeric film and optimized the immobilization conditions of beta-galactosidase from Escherichia coli onto this polymeric film by using response surface methodology (RSM). For this purpose, three-level and three-factor Box-Behnken design, which is an independent, rotatable or nearly rotatable, quadratic design, was applied. Optimal levels of three variables, namely, the amount of enzyme, immobilization time, and pH were determined using Box-Behnken experimental design. Lactose hydrolysis studies were performed from milk and lactose samples using free and immobilized enzyme. In addition, kinetic parameters, storage stability, and re-usability of immobilized beta-galactosidase were examined. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Pathogen-specific changes in composition and quality traits of milk from goats affected by subclinical intramammary infections.		Journal of Dairy Research					We investigated the effects of pathogens associated with subclinical intramammary infections on yield, composition and quality indicators of goat milk. By means of a longitudinal study, individual half udder milk samples (n=132) were collected at different lactation periods and assessed for milk yield and physicochemical composition, somatic cell count (SCC), total bacteria count (TBC) and microbiological culture. Staphylococci species accounted for the great majority of the isolates (96.1%). Intramammary infections significantly reduced fat and total solids in goat milk and increased both SCC and TBC. However, these indicators were significantly higher in udder halves affected by S. aureus compared with other staphylococci species. © The Author(s), 2021.

Carboxymethyl-glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduces blood pressure and improves baroreflex sensitivity in spontaneously hypertensive rats.		Food & Function					Carboxymethyl-glucan (CMG) is a derivative of beta-d-glucan extracted from Sacharomyces cerevisae. This polymer presents improved physicochemical properties and shows health benefits, such as immunomodulation, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and antiplatelet activities, and improved vascular function. However, studies concerning the effect of administration of CMG on the cardiovascular parameters, mainly in the field of hypertension, are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the effect of administration of CMG in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive rats (WKY) models. Normotensive and hypertensive animals received CMG at doses of 20 mg kg-1 and 60 mg kg-1 for four weeks. Then, weight gain, lipid profile, renal function, blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, baroreflex sensitivity, and sympathetic tone were evaluated. Oral administration of CMG influenced weight gain and cholesterol levels, and significantly reduced urea in the hypertensive animals. It decreased blood pressure levels and cardiac hypertrophy, improved baroreflex response, and reduced the influence of sympathetic tone. The results demonstrate the antihypertensive effect of CMG through improvement in baroreflex sensitivity via sympathetic tone modulation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.		de Medeiros, Isac Almeida/C-5784-2013; Veras, Robson/ABG-9139-2020; De Brito Alves, Jose Luiz/R-7175-2017; Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo/G-5025-2012; Magnani, Marciane/P-4265-2016	de Medeiros, Isac Almeida/0000-0001-8783-4806; Veras, Robson/0000-0002-2083-6898; Pimentel, Tatiana Colombo/0000-0003-4600-8932; Magnani, Marciane/0000-0002-7771-0479							2021	12	18	8552	8560	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01079d					FSTA:2022-01-Ad0352

Physicochemical characteristics and bioactive compounds of the Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) cactus from Caatinga Brazilian: are they nutritive and functional?		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) is a cactus found in the Caatinga biome which is used in folk medicine for treating inflammation, and also used in animal food. This study evaluated its proximate composition and bioactive compounds, as well as its bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity. Experiments were performed on different parts of the plant. The central stem of the xique-xique can be considered a source of insoluble dietary fiber (5.18 g/100 g) and soluble fiber (1.37 g/100 g). The vascular cylinder contained the highest mineral content: K (308.4 mg/100 g), Ca (145.57 mg/100 g), Mg (182.40 mg/100 g), and Mn (7.71 mg/100 g). The vascular cylinder group presented the highest activity for capturing DPPH radicals (572.96 M of TEAC/100 g) and ferric reducing ability (1912.95 M of TEAC/100 g). Catechin and epigallocatechin-gallate were the major phenolic compounds, while catechin, epigallocatechin gallate and procyanidin B and gallic acid were the most bioaccessible compounds after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Xique-xique can be considered as a potential food alternative with nutritional value and bioactive compounds, indicating its potential use and enrichment in various food products. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.		dos Santos Lima, Marcos/L-1662-2016; Milani, Raquel Fernanda/F-1866-2017; Pacheco, Maria Teresa Bertoldo/E-5339-2012	dos Santos Lima, Marcos/0000-0001-7057-4868; Milani, Raquel Fernanda/0000-0002-2403-960X; Pacheco, Maria Teresa Bertoldo/0000-0003-4776-1571							2021	15	4	3284	3297	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00906-w					FSTA:2021-12-Jg17158

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to evaluate the impact of xique-xique jam addition on the nutritional value and physicochemical and sensory characteristics of goat milk yogurt. The jam was characterized for its physicochemical characteristics, mineral profile, antinutritional factors, and phenolic compounds (profile and bioaccessibility). The jam presented a dark yellow color, was slightly acid (pH 4.61), and was characterized by its carbohydrate (67.17 g/100 g) and fiber (2.60 g/100 g) contents, mainly in an insoluble form (1.71 g/100 g). Potassium, magnesium, calcium, and manganese were found as main minerals, and there was no significant concentration of the antinutritional compounds (tannins, trypsin inhibitor and phytic acid). Finally, 13 phenolic compounds were identified from the flavanols, flavonols, phenolic acids and flavanones groups, presenting 2.79-172.52% bioaccessibility. The jam addition resulted in yogurts with higher nutritional value (lipid, protein and mineral content), and technological properties (higher moisture content during storage, lower acidity, and reduced viscosity) than conventional yogurt, with no impact on sensory acceptance (appearance, color, consistency, aroma, flavor, and overall acceptance) or sensory characteristics (Just about Right, aroma, consistency, texture, sweetness, flavor and acidity). It can be concluded that xique-xique jam can improve the nutritional value and technological properties of goat milk yogurt. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Detection of volatiles from raw beef meat from different packaging systems using solid-phase microextraction GC-accurate mass spectrometry.		Foods					The volatile profile of raw beef contains vital information related to meat quality and freshness. This qualitative study examines the effect of packaging system on the formation and release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from raw beef over time, relative to the packaging best before date (BBD). The three packaging systems investigated were modified atmospheric packaging, vacuum packaging, and cling-wrapped packaging. Porterhouse steak samples with the same BBD were analysed from 3 days before to 3 days after the BBD. VOCs were detected via preconcentration using solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. In total, 35 different VOCs were tentatively identified. Interestingly, there was no clear relationship of the VOCs detected between the three packaging systems, with only carbon disulphide and acetoin, both known volatiles of beef, detected in all three. This is the first study to investigate the effects of commercial packaging systems on VOC formation; it provides an understanding of the relationship of VOCs to the BBD that is essential for the development of on-pack freshness and quality sensors. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bhagya Raj, G. V. S.; Kshirod K. Dash							Heat transfer analysis of convective and microwave drying of dragon fruit.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The purpose of this study was to develop a predictive three-dimensional analytical model for predicting the temperature profile during microwave and convective drying of dragon fruit. A combined electromagnetic (Maxwell's equation) and heat transfer model was used for modeling of microwave drying. This heat transfer modeling is applicable to describe the thermal dissipation during the microwave and convective drying of agricultural produces. In this process, the dragon fruit cube of 15mm was dried at a microwave power of 200, 400, and 600W during the microwave drying process and hot air temperature of 60 °C during the convective drying process. During microwave drying, the core or center temperature was maximum compared with the temperature at the surface of the dragon fruit cube. The predicted temperature at the center of the dragon fruit cube exposed to the microwave power of 200, 400, and 600W for 60s of drying time was 34.67, 44.34, and 54.02°C, respectively. In convective drying, the temperature at the edges was higher than the temperature at the center point of the dragon fruit cube. During convective drying, the fruit sample attained the maximum temperature of 60°C after being exposed to hot air for 8 min. The RMSE and chi2 values between experimental and model projected values were less than 0.988 and 0.029 in microwave drying and less than 0.891 and 0.018 in convective drying, indicating that the model projected values were in good agreement with the experimental values. Practical Applications. The importance of thermal processes in deciding the safety and quality of food products is emergent. This model can predict food product temperature distribution during the hot air drying and microwave drying of Dragon fruit cubes. The economy of the drying process is often influenced by the nature and operation of these processes and hence modeling of the drying process is a crucial factor for the industry. These results can be used to quantify heat and moisture distribution, as well as to monitor the drying process of fruits and vegetables, saving energy and time. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	9			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13775					FSTA:2021-12-Jg17182
J		Bhagyashree Katare; Binkley, J. K.; Chen, K.							Nutrition and diet quality of food at home by Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) status.		Food Policy					We use the data from the four NHANES surveys conducted from 2007 to 2014 to compare the nutrition and diet quality of food at home (FAH) of current SNAP participants with that of two types of past participants-more recent and less recent-and with that of eligible non-participants. We investigate the three outcome measures of FAH diet quality: the USDA Healthy Eating Index (HEI), an index based on nutrient profiling, and a measure of calorie density. We also examine HEI components and consider selected healthy/unhealthy foods. Our estimates suggest that SNAP participation does not drive FAH diet quality. In particular, we find no evidence that current SNAP participants have a lower FAH nutrition or diet quality when compared to other groups that have participated in SNAP at more or less recent times in the past.

"Golden Delicious" during low-temperature postharvest storage.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, we investigated the time-course variations in the nutritionally important quality attributes of "Golden Delicious" apples kept under postharvest storage at 4°C. At harvest (0 day) and at day 15, 30, 45, 60, and 90 of postharvest storage, physicochemical properties, primary and secondary metabolites profile, and volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles were measured. Low-temperature storage significantly altered physicochemical characteristics, concentrations of 22 primary metabolites, 12 secondary metabolites, and 41 VOCs in the stored apples. Apples stored for different storage durations could be separated using partial least squares-discriminant analysis with VOCs as variables. In total, 13 VOCs showed variable importance in projection score more than one, and those VOCs are considered as potential shelf-life biomarkers for apples under storage with especial emphasis on alpha-farnesene. This study added new insights on the systematic metabolic changes occurring in "Golden Delicious" apples under prolonged low-temperature storage. The biomarker VOCs detected in this study showed excellent correlation with storage duration and estimation of those VOCs will help us in the non-destructive prediction of fruit shelf-life. Additionally, metabolite profile data can be used to correlate storage duration with the fruit nutritional level, which is of especial interest to the consumers and the apple industry.

J		Bhakti Shinde; Hosahalli S. Ramaswamy							Optimization of maltodextrin (10DE)-sucrose moderated microwave osmotic dehydration of mango cubes under continuous flow spray mode (MWODS) conditions.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The process of microwave osmotic dehydration of mango was optimized under continuous flow medium spray conditions (MWODS) with maltodextrin (10DE) moderated sucrose solutions. Optimization was carried out using a response surface methodology with a central composite rotatable (CCRD) design with three input variables at five levels (temperature, 33°C to 66.7°C; sucrose: maltodextrin ratio from 100:0 to 80:20; and solute concentration, 33 to 66.7%). The response parameters used for optimization were moisture loss (ML), solids gain (SG), weight reduction (WR), ML/SG ratio, color and texture values. For each response, RSM models (p<.05) were developed. As expected, all output variables were responsive to process variables and addition of maltodextrin to sucrose was found to have a significant effect on reducing the SG and increasing ML/SG, and total solute concentration had significant effects on ML, SG and quality parameters. The process was optimized by desirability approach and MWODS at 56°C with total osmotic solute 46% concentration and 84:16 sucrose: maltodextrin proportion had the highest desirability value. Selection of constraints was an influential factor as well. Practical Applications. Osmotic dehydration (OD) has many advantages, but is a slow process. Carrying out OD in MW environment accelerates the process, enhances moisture loss (ML) and limits the solids gain (SG). The quality of OD foods is related to ML/SG ratio and the MWOD process enhances ML/SG. This can be further enhanced by incorporating high molecular solutes like maltodextrins. This research optimizes the maltodextrin moderated MWOD process under continuous medium flow conditions. The process offers significant potential for reducing the treatment time (to 30min) and improve the ML/SG ratio. The resulting product can be finish dried, used as intermediate moisture food or frozen (dehydrofreezing). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13835					FSTA:2022-03-Jd2961

Mahmoud							Antioxidant, scavenging, reducing, and anti-proliferative activities of selected tropical brown seaweeds confirm the nutraceutical potential of Spatoglossum asperum.		Foods					Brown seaweeds have shown high potential of bioactivity and provide health benefits as an important functional food ingredient. Therefore, four abundantly growing tropical brown seaweeds Iyengaria stellata, Spatoglossum asperum, Sargassum linearifolium, and Stoechospermum polypodioideswere collected from the Saurashtra Coast of the Arabian Sea. They were analyzed for metabolite profiling, biochemical activities (including total antioxidant, reducing, scavenging, and anti-proliferative characteristics), and total phenolic and flavonoid contents. A concentration-dependent antioxidant, reducing, and scavenging activities were observed for all four brown seaweeds. The S. asperum and I. stellata extracts showed maximum total antioxidant activity. S. asperum also showed high scavenging and reducing activities compared to other studied brown seaweeds. Further, S. asperum contained high total phenolic and flavonoid content compared to other brown seaweeds collected from the same coast. A multivariate correlation study confirmed a positive correlation between total phenolic and flavonoid contents, and biochemical activities (total antioxidant, scavenging and reducing) for all brown seaweeds. About 35% anti-proliferative activity was observed with S. asperum extract on Huh7 cells; in contrast S. Polypodioide showed about 44% proliferation inhibition of Huh7 cells. Similarly, 26% proliferation inhibition of HeLa cells was observed with S. asperum extract. Overall, S. asperum possesses high total flavonoid and phenolic amounts, and showed potential antioxidant, scavenging and reducing characteristics. The study confirmed the nutraceutical potential of S. asperum and that it could be a promising functional food ingredient. © 2021 by the authors.

Process scale-up and technoeconomic analysis of phospholipid extraction from a dairy byproduct (whey protein phospholipid concentrate).		Journal of Dairy Science					Dairy byproducts such as whey protein phospholipid concentrate (WPPC) and buttermilk contain phospholipids (PL). A solvent extraction process (simultaneous texturization and extraction of phospholipids, STEP method) to extract PL present in WPPC, using ethanol, recovers about 70% of PL in the raw material. To understand the commercial feasibility of this technology, we simulated a scaled-up version of the process to industrial production of 3.26 kt/yr in the SuperPro Designer (version 10, http: //www.intelligen.com) process simulation platform. Economic analysis revealed that PL can be produced at a minimum selling price (MSP) of $92.98/kg, using the scaled-up STEP method. The total investment on capital and annual operating costs were $15.51 million and $14.49 million, respectively. The uncertainty in product cost due to variations in process variables, including PL composition in raw material, product recovery, labor, and raw material costs was analyzed through sensitivity analysis. Phospholipids MSP was most sensitive to product recovery and its composition in WPPC. A reduction of almost 5% in MSP was achieved by improving either of the process parameters by 10%. By increasing the plant size 1.5 times, the product MSP could be decreased by 30% to $65.14/kg. Finally, based on our analysis, recommendations were made for scale-up and commercialization of PL extraction using the STEP method.

Khan							Chemical profiling and characterization of anthraquinones from two Bulbine species and dietary supplements using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Bulbine natalensis Baker and Bulbine frutescens (L.) Willd., belonging to the family Asphodelaceae, are widely distributed in South Africa and traditionally used as an aphrodisiac and skin remedies. Objective. The aim of this study is to develop an analytical method for chemical profiling and identification of components in Bulbine species, which would be useful for herbal identification and understanding of the biological activity of B. natalensis in terms of safety and benefits to human health. Method. The anthraquinone-type compounds were structurally characterized from the extracts of dried stem and roots of Bulbine species and dietary supplements using liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QToF) with negative and positive ion electrospray. The calculated accurate masses of the protonated and deprotonated molecules and fragment ions were used for identification of the components from two Bulbine species. Results. A total of 55 anthraquinone-type compounds, including 11 standard compounds, were identified in the crude extracts of two Bulbine species. Two Bulbine species and dietary supplements were clustered into different groups and possible chemical markers were identified. Conclusions. The developed analytical method provided a fast and economic method for quality assessment of Bulbine species in dietary supplements based on anthraquinone-type compounds. Highlights. This study reports holistic chemical profiling of Bulbine species using LC-QToF. The developed analytical method enabled non-targeted analysis of components in B. natalensis and B. frutescens, and is recommended for commercial and regulatory purposes. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2021.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					A lab-scale ohmic heater was designed and fabricated using stainless steel cylindroconical process chamber with one litre holding capacity fixed with a pair of titanium electrodes in the process chamber. The ohmic heater was validated by processing green mussel meat (Perna viridis) by varying voltage and duration of the heating process. Different voltages viz. 100 V and 120 V were attempted for process duration of 5 and 10 min. The processed mussel meat was tested for physical (cook loss), proximate (moisture, protein, fat, and ash), microbial (total plate count), and organoleptic (overall acceptability) quality to understand the effectiveness of ohmic heating to make the product safe for consumption. Based on the trial undertaken with mussel meat, ohmic heating at 120 voltage for 5 min was found suitable to process green mussel meat in terms of above mentioned quality attributes. Ohmic heater designed in this study could be an effective alternative to the conventional heating process in seafood processing. Practical applications. The conventional cooking methods such as steaming and boiling would lead to heterogeneous heating due to low rate of heat penetration which results in a reduction of yield whereas ohmic heating is reported to retain the nutrients without much loss. In this study, the ohmic heater was fabricated and validated for its potential for cooking green mussel meat. This study will support seafood industries to adopt ohmic heating for the thermal processing of seafood for better retention of valuable nutrients. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15511					FSTA:2021-10-Re3548
J		Bhargavi, N.; Dhathathreyan, A.; Eeram, K. J.							Regulating structural and mechanical properties of pectin reinforced liposomes at fluid/solid interface.		Food Hydrocolloids					This work presents the design and study of pectin (PEC) reinforced Egg Lecithin (EPC) liposomes and their structural, mechanical and thermal properties at fluid/solid interface. The liposomes have been analyzed using ATR-FTIR, DSC, SAXS and Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with dissipation. An asymmetric melting temperature profile in DSC thermograms with increasing concentration of PEC suggested reduced co-operativity of lipids in the vesicles resulting from different populations of PEC associated lipids. QCM showed PEC stabilized EPC liposome has nearly an order higher mechanical strength compared with EPC as also seen from enhanced heat capacity in DSC. SAXS shows that the PEC locating in the lipid bilayer results in swelling in the non-polar region (~30%) and a reduction in overall bilayer thickness (~6%) compared with that of pure EPC. The nearly equal rotation correlation time taur for EPC (3.250.18 ns) and PEC stabilized liposomes (3.200.2 ns) from fluorescence spectroscopy suggests that PEC in lipid bilayers does not induce any structural deformations. These liposomes visualized by transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy show well-defined morphology. The findings offer a new perspective on understanding the interactions between lipid molecules and biopolymers and may aid in designing stable composite delivery vehicles.

Development of ready-to-cook shrimp analogue from surimi: effect of natural plant extracts on the chemical quality during refrigerated storage.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, the effects of spray-dried cluster bean extract (T-1), freeze-dried ethanol extract of coconut husk (T-2) and control (C) on the shelf life of ready-to-cook shrimp analogue prepared from tilapia surimi at refrigerated temperature (51 °C) were evaluated. The proximate composition of the shrimp analogues was significantly affected by the incorporation of the additives during the storage. The lower levels of total volatile basic nitrogen values were detected for T-1 and T-2 shrimp analogues. T-2 samples exhibited a lower pH (7.16-6.28) values as days progressed respectively. Elevated levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values were observed in all the treatments including the control. The water holding capacity of T-1 revealed lower values than the control. In texture profile analysis, the highest cohesiveness value was found in T-2 shrimp analogues. The interpretation of sensory attributes i.e.general appearance, colour, odour, texture and overall acceptability of shrimp analogue containing two different additives combined with the storage days was subjected to principal component analysis and most of the data has fallen in component 1. Overall, the work suggests that ethanol extract of coconut husk can be a promising candidate for extending the shelf-life of ready-to-cook surimi-based products.

Wu							Effects of moisture content and mild heat on the ability of gaseous chlorine dioxide against Salmonella and Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 on almonds.		Food Control					Contamination of almonds with pathogenic Salmonella can be detrimental to consumers' health and causes deterioration of the product. This study evaluated the effect of gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) with mild heat and moisture against pathogenic Salmonella enterica and its surrogate inoculated on almonds. Almonds were inoculated with pathogenic Salmonella enterica and nonpathogenic surrogate Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354. A dry precursor method was used to produce gaseous ClO2 to treat almonds in an airtight desiccator chamber. A 20-g precursor dose was used to generate ClO2 to treat almonds with, (i) original moisture content (MC, 4%), (ii) increased MC (7%), and (iii) increased MC (7%) and mild heat (40 °C1.5). Almonds were exposed to these treatment conditions for 1,2, 3, and 4 h. Chlorine dioxide treatment demonstrated bacterial reductions of 1.2 log CFU/g on Salmonella at 3 h and 0.9 log CFU/g on E. faecium NRRL B-2354 at 4 h. Gas treatment with the addition of moisture on almonds resulted in bacterial log reductions of 1.8 CFU/g on Salmonella, and 1.0 CFU/g on E. faecium NRRL B-2354 at 3 h. Gaseous ClO2 with additional moisture and heat contributed the highest bacterial reduction on almonds at 3 h (2.0 CFU/g on Salmonella and 1.6 CFU/g on E. faecium NRRL B-2354). Bacterial reductions observed on Salmonella were statistically (P> 0.05) similar to E. faecium NRRL B-2354. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis displayed the complex 3-dimensional surface of almonds in comparison to coupons. Bacterial cells were observed to be covered in lipids and settled in crevices on almond surfaces, potentially harboring the bacteria from gaseous ClO2 treatments. The present study demonstrated the importance of combination treatments, including gaseous ClO2, mild heat, and moisture, to reduce pathogens Salmonella enterica on almonds. These results help to understand the effect of combined mild heat and moisture, which can be optimized for potential processing of almonds.

Effects of cod liver oil fortification on the quality aspects of mince sausages from Indian Major Carp (Labeorohita).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Fortification of mince with PUFA-containing oil is an innovative area in product development. In this study, functional sausages were developed from Rohu mince with different concentrations of cod liver oil (CLO) and evaluated for their physiochemical and fatty acid compositions. Fortification of mince sausage with 4% CLO showed highest gel strength (323.58 g.cm) to the product. The CLO product had a higher n-3/n-6 ratio (1.79-3.65 versus 1.19 in control). The electrophoretic pattern of proteins showed the polymerization of proteins in the presence of CLO. The scanning electron microscopy revealed fine texture, absence of more voids, and homogenous structure in 4% CLO-fortified sausages. Hardness values are improved by the addition of CLO with a positive whiteness index and showed better sensory scores during the study period. Therefore, fortification of mince sausages with CLO could improve the health benefits by providing the optimal concentration of essential fatty acids along with good consumer acceptance. Practical applications. The mince from Indian Major Carp, Rohu, can be successfully utilized for the development of sausages like ready-to-eat products. The fortification of mince sausages with cod liver oil (CLO) would provide an optimum concentration of essential fatty acid to offer multiple health benefits. The present study was able to achieve a ratio (n-6/n-3) of 0.55 to 0.27 in CLO-fortified sausages, which was considered optimal for human health. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15596					FSTA:2021-11-Sr6492

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Edible mushrooms are natural sources for numerous bioactive properties which can protect human body from oxidative damages, hypertension, abnormal cell growth etc., The present study disclosed that, bioactive properties of mushroom proteins are significantly enhanced by adopting enzymatic hydrolysis. This study established the mushroom protein hydrolysates (MPHs), produced from freshly cultivated edible mushroom, Pleurotus ostreatus, could be the supreme source of both bioactive and nutraceutical compounds. Here, both unhydrolysed mushroom extract (UME) and proteinase K treated MPHs of different degrees of hydrolysis DH% (55%, 60%, 65%, 70% and 80%) under optimized condition were evaluated for antioxidative, angiotensin rennin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory and antiproliferative activities at different concentrations (2.5, 5 and 10 mg/ml). Among these, 65% DH at 10 mg/ml exhibited profound antioxidative (DPPH, ABTS, hydroxyl radical scavenging, metal chelating, linoleic acid auto-oxidation, FRAP, and reducing power) and ACE inhibitory activities. Maximum amount of total phenolic and flavonoid content was also obtained in this case. MTT assay confirmed the remarkable antiproliferative properties of MPHs against human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa). Presence of a wide range of phenolic (i.e., gallic, trans-cinnamic, caffeic, ferulic, aspartic and vanillic acid) and flavonoid (quercetin) compounds in both UME and MPHs were identified through HPLC.

Cooking does not impair the impact of pulsed electric field on the protein digestion of venison (Cervus elaphus) during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The present study was conducted to elucidate whether cooking impairs the positive effect of pulsed electric field (PEF) on the digestibility of venison during in vitro gastrointestinal protein digestion. Previous studies have used fresh uncooked meat to demonstrate the effect of PEF on protein digestibility during gastrointestinal digestion neglecting the effect that cooking could induce during meat preparation process. PEF-treated samples (T1, 10 kV, 90 Hz, 20 s) were cooked (core temperature of 75 °C) and subjected to in vitro simulated gastrointestinal protein digestion along with non-treated controls. A 3% increase of in vitro protein digestibility was found in cooked PEF-treated venison (P< 0.05). A positive (P< 0.05) impact of PEF processing was observed on overall protein digestion as measured by soluble protein (%) and SDS-PAGE.

J		Bhavadharini Boopathy; Stephen, J.; Anbarasan Rajan; Mahendran Radhakrishnan							Evaluation of temperature and concentration on the development of rice hydrogel and 2D xerogel.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The gelification behavior of starch in rice flour was investigated for its application on food structuring to produce rice xerogel. The effect of hydrogel nature in drying was studied for the xerogel surface design. The impact of changes in rice flour was found by the least gelation concentration and pasting properties. It exhibited 4% (w/v) gelatinized rice flour dispersion and can form a 3D polymer network during cooling. Assessment of hydrogel preparation temperature was examined by swelling power, solubility, surface tension, contact angle, and transmittance. An increase in swelling power, solubility, and density is due to the effective binding of starch with water molecules. The decline in absorbance specifies loss of crystallinity and birefringence because of starch granules disruption. Surface tension increased, and contact angle decreased at a higher temperature because of gelling nature. Various concentrations (2%, 4%, and 6%) of rice flour dispersion were exposed to heat at temperatures (60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 °C) for developing rice xerogel. It was observed that 4% (w/v) of rice flour suspension gellified at 90 °C possesses better structural integrity without deformation and cracks. Novelty Impact Statement. The obtained 2D rice xerogel with the addition of flavor could be utilized in complex-shaped foods like chips, pasta, and noodles. As 2D flour-based materials are capable of undergoing shape change into a 3D form during frying/cooking, this is an arising innovation that could encourage diminishing packaging and shipping costs as well as to design user-customized attractive materials. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15853					FSTA:2022-01-Ae0973
J		Bhavesh Panchal; Tuyen Truong; Sangeeta Prakash; Nidhi Bansal; Bhesh Bhandari							Influence of emulsifiers and dairy ingredients on manufacturing, microstructure, and physical properties of butter.		Foods					The influence of emulsifiers and dairy solids on churning and physical attributes of butter was investigated. Commercial dairy cream was blended with each of the ingredients (0.5%, w/ w) separately, aged overnight (10 °C), and churned (10 °C) into butter. The employed additives showed a distinctive impact on the macroscopic properties of butter without largely affecting the melting behavior. In fresh butter, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR) emulsifier having dominated hydrophobic moieties significantly (p< 0.05) enhanced the softness. Among dairy solids, sodium caseinate (SC) was the most effective in reducing the solid fat fraction, hardness, and elastic modulus (G'), while whey protein isolate (WPI) and whole milk powder (WMP) produced significantly harder, stiffer, and more adhesive butter texture. As per tribological analysis, PGPR, Tween 80, and SC lowered the friction-coefficient of butter, indicating an improved lubrication property of the microstructure. The extent of butter-setting during 28 days of storage (5 °C) varied among the samples, and in specific, appeared to be delayed in presence of WPI, WMP, and buttermilk solids. The findings of the study highlighted the potential of using applied emulsifiers and dairy-derived ingredients in modifying the physical functionality of butter and butter-like churned emulsions in addition to a conventional cream-ageing process. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bhavesh Panchal; Tuyen Truong; Sangeeta Prakash; Nidhi Bansal; Bhesh Bhandari							Influence of fat globule size, emulsifiers, and cream-aging on microstructure and physical properties of butter.		International Dairy Journal					The impact of fat globule (FG) size (d3,2 0.24-3.60 mum) of cream and added emulsifiers on physical attributes of butter was investigated under two cream-tempering regimes: aged (10 °C, 15-17 h) and non-aged. Reduction in FG size increased the globular fat populous of butter microstructure, which appeared to promote crystal aggregation. The emulsifier-type, however, strongly influenced the globule-matrix interactions. Comprehensively, the sodium caseinate stabilised FGs (d3,2 0.48 mum) acted as solid filler particles promoting the structure and firmness of butter. In contrast, coexistence of Tween 80 on FG interface (d3,2 0.24 mum) promoted the globule-matrix de-bonding and fracture propagation causing a reduction in hardness, elastic modulus, and friction-coefficient. Butter made from non-aged smaller FGs (d3,2 0.24 mum) remained considerably softer than the native aged cream butter (d3,2 3.49 mum) after four weeks of storage (5 °C), implying the possibility of improving butter spreadability without a conventional cream-aging approach.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The demand of health boosting conventional snacks is increasing among the consumers. Rice is gluten free, has superior amino acid profile and known to be non-allergic. Brown rice is the whole grain which offers nutritional benefits in addition to polished (white) rice like being rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals and good fats, due to its intact germ and bran layer. This study aimed at finding the use and acceptability of brown rice flour (BRF) as a replacement to refined wheat flour (RWF) in cookies. The BRF and RWF were analyzed for their proximate composition. Cookies were formulated with 0 (control), 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% replacement of RWF with BRF. The functional properties of these blends were evaluated. Formulated cookies were analyzed for their proximate composition, sensory parameters (on hedonic scale) and for sensory textural parameters. The addition of BRF resulted in an increase in water absorption capacity and decrease in oil absorption capacity of flour blends. The BRF incorporation significantly (p<0.05) increased the fat, fiber and ash contents of the formulated cookies. The addition of up to 40% BRF was found acceptable by sensory panel with average liking score of 7 and above. Also electromyography (EMG) study of the chewing process of cookies was conducted and the acquired EMG parameters were correlated with sensory textural parameters for comprehensive understanding of the texture. The results indicated that sensorial texture perceptions can be correlated with the EMG parameters to comprehensively explain the food texture. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	219	227	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00625-8					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3168
J		Bhavnita Dhillon; Kamalpreet Kaur; Singh Sodhi, N.; Riya Garg							Physicochemical, antioxidant and microbial properties of whole wheat breads formulated with the incorporation of vegetable paste.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Whole wheat is an important source of dietary fiber and its consumption is known to lower the risk of colon cancer, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Also, World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended increased consumption of vegetables to overcome micronutrient deficiencies and prevent chronic diseases. Thus this study aimed at formulation of whole wheat breads fortified with vegetable paste (made with equal quantities of peas, cauliflower and mushrooms). Four types of breads were formulated; one with 100% whole wheat flour (WWF) (B1) and others by substituting WWF with vegetable paste at the level of 15% (B2), 30% (B3), and 45% (B4). The breads were analysed for their proximate composition, antioxidant properties, physical properties, microbial count and sensory attributes. The incorporation of vegetable paste increased the moisture, ash and protein contents of breads which were 83.5%, 45.9% and 30.2%, respectively, higher in B4 breads than in B1 breads. The 45% substitution of vegetable paste in whole wheat flour increased the total phenolic content of breads by 45% and antioxidant activity by 61.5%. Whereas, the loaf volume decreased and hardness of breads increased with the increase in the percentage of vegetable paste substitution. The aerobic plate count and yeast and mold count of the formulated breads were in acceptable range even after 5 days of storage. Sensory scores revealed that B2 bread was having the highest overall acceptability score of 7.5 which was even higher than the score of commercially available wheat bread (7.3). ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1068	1074	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00708-6					FSTA:2021-10-Mn6157
J		Bhavnita Dhillon; Tamanna Awasthi; Singh Sodhi, N.; Singh Sogi, D.; Sunanda Jaiswal							A comparative study to investigate the effects of addition of milk and sugar on total polyphenol, flavonoid, catechin and tannin contents of green and black teas consumed in India.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Tea is a rich source of functional components called polyphenols which impart it antioxidant properties. Tea is categorized as green or black tea according to the processing method used. Tea is widely consumed beverage, and it is often prepared with the addition of milk and sugar in many parts of the world including India. The present study was conducted to compare the effect of addition of milk and/or sugar, in both black and green teas of two brands (1 and 2), on the antioxidant properties of teas. The total polyphenol, flavonoid and catechin contents along with antioxidant activity were significantly (p< 0.05) higher in green teas then in black teas but the tannin content of black teas was higher than that of green teas. The addition of milk in both black and green teas significantly (p< 0.05) reduced total polyphenol, flavonoid, catechin and tannin contents as well as antioxidant activity. The addition of sugar had significant (p< 0.05) adverse effect on flavonoid and catechin contents, and antioxidant activity. Further, the combined addition of milk and sugar caused significant (p< 0.05) additive/synergistic reductions in flavonoid content of teas of both brands, and in catechin content, tannin content and antioxidant activity of black and green teas of brand 2 only. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4652	4658	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01036-z					FSTA:2022-01-Hn0522

Journal of Dairy Science					Camel milk (CM) is gaining scientific attention due to its potential health and therapeutic benefits. Fermented drinkable yogurts (labans) were prepared from CM and bovine milk (BM) using mixed Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus bacteria supplemented with 1 of 2 hydrocolloids: pectin (0.1-0.3%) or sodium alginate (0.1-0.5%). The different labans were compared by studying their acidity and rheology as well as their structural and sensory properties. The CM and BM labans had titratable acidity values that ranged from 0.85 to 1.27 and 0.61 to 0.93%, respectively. Pectin at 0.2% enhanced the rheological properties of BM labans, but had no effect in CM labans. Sodium alginate at 0.3% and 0.5% increased viscosity, elastic or storage modulus (G′), and viscous or loss modulus (G) values for both types of laban. Scanning electron microscopy indicated that the CM laban contained lower levels of "spike-like structures" than BM laban, and that the addition of hydrocolloids improved this effect. Quantitative descriptive sensory analysis showed that CM labans fortified with either 0.2% pectin or 0.3% sodium alginate were comparable to commercial BM laban in viscous mouthfeel. Fortified CM labans were more acidic and had stronger flavors than unfortified samples. Overall, this study demonstrated that the addition of sodium alginate or pectin at intermediate levels permits production of palatable CM labans of a satisfactory viscous consistency.

J		Bhomik Gupta; Pooja Dalal; Rekha Rao							Cyclodextrin decorated nanosponges of sesamol: antioxidant, anti-tyrosinase and photostability assessment.		Food Bioscience					Sesamol (SES), a natural phenolic bioactive, is endowed with benefits in food and pharmaceuticals. However, its utility is compromised by certain unfavorable physicochemical characteristics, particularly poor stability. Therefore, present work is aimed at formulating novel SES loaded cyclodextrin nanosponges (CDNS) to protect the drug from degradation. For this purpose, blank CDNS were fabricated employing solvent evaporation technique and subsequently SES loading via lyophilization. Characterization of SES-CDNS was carried out by Fourier transform infrared analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, and nuclear magnetic resonance. These nanostructures were also evaluated for entrapment efficiency, particle size, polydispersity index, and zeta potential. Further, photostability assessment was conducted for SES-CDNS, along with stability evaluation. Antioxidant potential of SES was determined using DPPH assay, after its encapsulation and storage. Lastly, in vitro anti-tyrosinase assay was also performed for SES-CDNS. Results demonstrated that SES was successfully entrapped in CDNS having size in nano-range (189.46 6.57) and assuring high encapsulation efficiency (90.66%). The findings of the photostability evaluation showed that CDNS was able to protect SES from photodegradation. Furthermore, oxygen radical absorbance capacity was found preserved for SES, especially when encapsulated in CDNS. No significant differences were observed after three months storage (at room temperature), with regard to loss of structural and functional features of SES. Hence, the results confirmed that nanoformulation is ideal for encapsulation of SES to enhance its physicochemical stability and to preserve antioxidant and anti-tyrosinase activity of this bioactive.

Potential utilization of guar straw and wood wool in controlling relative humidity and temperature of storage environment.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					In this study, guar straw and wood wool were used for the development of a relative humidity (RH) and temperature control system based on the storage requirement of onions in a semi-arid region. The RH and temperature control system includes two major units: (a) dehumidification-three compartments of guar straw balls/guar balls and (b) humidification-water-saturated wood wool pad (evaporative cooling). Guar balls of ~25mm diameter were made by mixing 40% straw powder, 59.5% water, and 0.5% guar gum (wt/wt). The balls were dried until 5.6% moisture level before using in dehumidification unit and analyzed for thermal properties. The RH and temperature control system was evaluated for its ability to maintain the requisite RH inside the onion storage structure. The dehumidification unit can reduce the RH by 4.9% and the humidification unit can increase the RH by 4.2% in the storage chamber. Further, the humidification unit has a cooling efficiency of 83.3%. The control system was efficient in maintaining the necessary storage RH in a range of 60-70% with a variation of 1.5%, and 22-37 °C storage temperature. Therefore, the storability of the onions in the conditioned environment was close to five months compared to three and a half months in control/ambient condition. Overall, the novel guar straw balls showed the desiccant properties that can be used with water-saturated wood wool for controlling RH and temperature of a storage environment. Practical Applications. Agricultural waste generally remains unutilized that create disposal and environmental challenges. Hence, the task of agricultural waste management is paramount. For farm and industrial applications, the development of low-cost desiccants and systems for controlling conditioned atmosphere using agricultural waste is interesting. In the present study, a relative humidity (RH) and temperature control system was developed using guar straw and wood wool. The control system is proved to be efficient in maintaining the storage requirement of onions; thus, extended the storage life significantly. This environmental-friendly system can be used, in storage, preservation and drying of food products. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	2			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13618					FSTA:2021-06-Jk7265

A statistical approach to describe the ripening evolution of Sangiovese grapes coming from different Chianti Classico sub-areas.		Foods					In Italy, Chianti Classico identifies a territory located in the heart of Tuscany that was once known as Chianti. From the pedological point of view, the entire DOCG (Denomination of controlled and guaranteed origin) has some common features but also shows many specific features related to certain small areas that give rise to the presence of many "terroirs". Due to the intertwining created by the alternation of valleys and hills and the different characteristics of the territory, factors such as altitude and exposure play a very important role in the vegetative and productive expression of grapes. Some production areas were identified within the appellation where it is argued that the terroir and the grapes are quite distinct from those of other surrounding areas, albeit within the Chianti Classico appellation. On the basis of this information and considering that no data are available in the literature, the present study proposed an innovative multidisciplinary approach (analytical and statistical) that was capable of carrying out an objective evaluation of the various sub-areas investigated, using Sangiovese grapes as the variety in question. This research took into account the climatic results and the different pedological characteristics, evaluating the evolutionary phenomena that were linked to the ripening of the grapes in each phase of its formation. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate frozen acid casein and its application in the production of processed cheese on an industrial scale considering the real logistics of a dairy product. Changes in protein were evidenced by relative casein, electropherograms and microstructure. Also, the melting time was longer for frozen acid casein to obtain the standard moisture content. The texture profile introduced increase in hardness with the increase in freezing time. Positive results were found for the b* colour parameter, tending the characteristic yellow colour of processed cheese. However, these changes were not observed in the chemical parameters of the processed cheese, indicating that frozen acid casein can be used to produce processed cheese with characteristics that meet industry standards.

An innovative active food packaging material based on cocrystallization of microbiologically active compounds present in essential oils i.e. carvacrol, thymol and cinnamaldehyde was developed following the Quality by Design principles. The selected active components were used to produce antimicrobial plastic films with solidified active ingredients on their surface characterized by antimicrobial properties against four bacterial strains involved in fruit and vegetable spoilage. The developed packaging prototypes exhibited good antimicrobial activity in vitro providing inhibition percentage of 69 (15)% by contact and inhibition diameters of 32 (6) mm in the gas phase, along with a prolonged release of the active components.

J		Bianchi, F.; Punsch, M.; Venir, E.							Effect of processing and storage on the quality of beetroot and apple mixed juice.		Foods					In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the development of health-promoting and disease-preventing functional foods. Beetroot is a promising vegetable because of its outstanding antioxidant activity, vivid colour, and content of bioactive compounds. In the present study, the quality of pure beetroot and apple juices as well as that of their mixture was evaluated by measuring changes of colour, betalain content, and antioxidant activity during processing and storage. No perceivable colour changes of the beetroot juice were observed after adding apple juice up to 85% of the total amount. However, the antioxidant activity was proportionally reduced with the addition of apple juice. Pasteurization negatively affected the content of betalains but did not influence the antioxidant activity. Storage led to colour modifications and reduction of betalains and antioxidant activity. Through preliminary shelf-life studies, a durability of 65 days at room temperature for apple and beetroot juice blends was calculated. The novelty of this study lies in an extended description of physico-chemical characteristics of a fresh apple and beetroot blended juice obtained from local products, in the study of the effects of processing and storage on its quality, and in the estimation of its shelf-life after storage at different temperatures. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bianchi, F.; Lomuscio, E.; Rizzi, C.; Simonato, B.							Predicted shelf-life, thermodynamic study and antioxidant capacity of breadsticks fortified with grape pomace powders.		Foods					Grape pomace (GP), is the main winemaking by-product and could represent a valuable functional food ingredient being a source of bioactive compounds, like polyphenols. Polyphenols prevent many non-communicable diseases and could contrast the oxidation reaction in foods. However, the high content in polyunsaturated fatty acid, the described pro-oxidant potential action of some polyphenols and the complex interactions with other components of matrices during food processing must be considered. Indeed, all these factors could promote oxidative reactions and require focused and specific assay. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of GP powder (GPP) addition (at 0%, 5% and 10% concentrations) in breadsticks formulations both on the antioxidant activity at room temperature during storage and on the shelf-life by the OXITEST predictive approach. GPP fortification increased the total polyphenols content and the antioxidant activities of breadsticks. FRAP reduced during the first two days of storage at room temperature, TPC increased during the 75 days, while ABTS showed a slight progressive decrease. However, GP negatively influenced OXITEST estimated shelf-life of breadsticks, incrementing the oxidation rate. In conclusion, even if GP fortification of breadsticks could improve the nutritional value of the products, the increased commercial perishability represents a drawback that must be considered. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bianchi, G.; Scalzo, R. L.; Fibiani, M.; Paolo, D.; Vignati, M.; Campanelli, G.; Kidmose, U.							Quality assessment of dried organic bell peppers through composition and sensory analysis.		European Food Research and Technology					A comprehensive quality evaluation was performed on dried sweet bell pepper samples obtained from two years of production, two genotypes and two drying technologies, using one conventional and two organic cropping systems. A total number of 35 quality indexes, comprising non-volatile and volatile flavor compounds and health related compounds were evaluated for their possible role in the flavor of dried bell pepper: the most significant variations in the data analysis due to the year, drying technique, genotype and cropping system resulted in 25, 25, 16 and 10 significant interactions, respectively. The PCA analysis confirmed the main role of drying technique and sampling year. The malic acid for non-volatile compounds, linalool and 2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine for volatiles represent the most relevant chemical indexes significantly correlating with many sensory descriptors scored by panellists, and are, therefore, proposed as quality markers to be carefully monitored for a correct quality evaluation of dried bell pepper. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Quality and Preference					Expert wine tasters have a greater ability than non-experts to discriminate between and evaluate the sensory properties of wine. In this paper we explore non-experts' understanding of a set of 64 terms which are frequently used as descriptors of the sensory properties of wine. These terms can be found in guidebooks on Italian wine, in production specifications and in the official tasting scales of the Italian Sommelier Association. The 64 target terms were selected in a preliminary phase of Study 1. These terms were then presented to 558 Italian non-expert consumers who were asked to identify the opposite of each target term, in relation to red and white wines respectively. The findings a) suggest that non-experts are able to think of the sensorial properties of wine in terms of dimensions modeled by two opposite poles (and it is interesting to note that this is in line with the bipolar structure of many dimensions used by experts); b) made it possible to identify the properties that are consistently associated by non-experts with the same dimension and those which, in contrast, evoke different opposites (i.e.the underlying dimension is less univocal) and c) reveal that the target properties generally evoke similar dimensions when applied to both red and white wines. In Study 2, the gap between the experts' interpretation of the terms and that of the non-experts was explored. Taken as a whole, the results of the study indicate an empirical methodology that may be used to investigate how standard consumers understand descriptions of wine. They may also provide food for thought regarding the ambiguity embedded in these descriptions due to potential discrepancies between the lexicons that experts and non-experts refer to in the world of wine tasting.

In vitro effects of paralytic shellfish toxins and lytic extracellular compounds produced by Alexandrium strains on hemocyte integrity and function in Mytilus edulis.		Toxins					Harmful effects caused by the exposure to paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) and bioactive extracellular compounds (BECs) on bivalves are frequently difficult to attribute to one or the other compound group. We evaluate and compare the distinct effects of PSTs extracted from Alexandrium catenella (Alex5) cells and extracellular lytic compounds (LCs) produced by A. tamarense (NX-57-08) on Mytilus edulis hemocytes. We used a 4 h dose-response in vitro approach and analyzed how these effects correlate with those observed in a previous in vivo feeding assay. Both bioactive compounds caused moderated cell death (10-15%), being dose-dependent for PST-exposed hemocytes. PSTs stimulated phagocytic activity at low doses, with a moderate incidence in lysosomal damage (30-50%) at all tested doses. LCs caused a dose-dependent impairment of phagocytic activity (up to 80%) and damage to lysosomal membranes (up to 90%). PSTs and LCs suppressed cellular ROS production and scavenged H2O2 in in vitro assays. Neither PSTs nor LCs affected the mitochondrial membrane potential in hemocytes. In vitro effects of PST extracts on M. edulis hemocytes were consistent with our previous study on in vivo exposure to PST-producing algae, while for LCs, in vivo and in vitro results were not as consistent. © 2021 by the authors.

Influence of dietary inclusion of tannin extracts from mimosa, chestnut and tara on volatile compounds and flavour in lamb meat.		Meat Science					Tannins are compounds able to form complexes with proteins limiting their ruminal degradation and thus the synthesis of some odour-active compounds may be inhibited . Tannins are broadly divided in condensed tannins (CT) and hydrolysable tannins (HT). The study aimed to assess the influence of dietary inclusion of three commercial tannin extracts, namely mimosa (Acacia mearnsii; CT), chestnut (Castanea sativa; HT) or tara (Caesalpinia spinosa; HT) on volatile profile and flavour of meat and kidney fat from lambs. Comisana male lambs were divided into four groups (n=9 each) and fed for 75 days with a concentrate-based diet (CON) or CON supplemented with 4% of one of the tannin extracts. Tannins reduced "pastoral" odour in perirenal fat of lambs the meat of which was characterized by a very low perception of this attribute. It may be assumed that p-cresol and 8-methylnonanoic acid mostly contributed to "pastoral" odour expression in the diet without condensed or hydrolysable tannins.

Food Chemistry					The present study aims at developing an analytical methodology which allows correlating sensory poles of chocolate to their chemical characteristics and, eventually, to those of the cocoa beans used for its preparation. Trained panelists investigated several samples of chocolate, and they divided them into four sensorial poles (characterized by 36 different descriptors) attributable to chocolate flavor. The same samples were analyzed by six different techniques: Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), Solid Phase Micro Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectroscopy (SPME-GC-MS), High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) (for the quantification of eight organic acids), Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography coupled to triple-quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (UHPLC-QqQ-MS) for polyphenol quantification, 3D front face fluorescence Spectroscopy and Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). A multi-block classification approach (Sequential and Orthogonalized-Partial Least Squares-SO-PLS) has been used, in order to exploit the chemical information to predict the sensorial poles of samples. Among thirty-one test samples, only two were misclassified. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Biandolino, F.; Parlapiano, I.; Denti, G.; Nardo, V. di; Prato, E.							Effect of different cooking methods on lipid content and fatty acid profiles of Mytilus galloprovincialis.		Foods					The effect of cooking (barbecue-grilling, boiling, microwaving, oven cooking and frying) on lipids, fatty acids (FAs) and lipid quality indices of the mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis was investigated. In general, all processing methods significantly (p< 0.05) modified the fatty acid profiles of mussels, although with major changes in fried samples, which exhibited the lowest saturated fatty acids and n-3 and highest polyunsaturated (PUFA) and n-6 FAs content. A significant decrease in the n-3 PUFA from the raw sample to five cooking methods was observed. The n-3/n-6 ratio decreased from raw (6.01) to cooked mussels, exhibiting the lowest value in fried ones (0.15). C20:5 n-3 and C22:6 n-3 significantly decreased during all cooking processes, and overall in fried mussels. It can be concluded that cooking does not compromise the nutritional quality of mussels except with frying, although it resulted in a decrease of the atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Biango-Daniels, M. N.; Wolfe, B. E.							American artisan cheese quality and spoilage: a survey of cheesemakers' concerns and needs.		Journal of Dairy Science					Production of artisan cheeses, including surface-ripened cheeses, has increased in the United States over the past 2 decades. Although many of these cheesemakers report unique quality and spoilage problems during production, a systematic assessment of the quality concerns facing this sector of specialty cheese production has not been conducted. Here we report the effects of microbial spoilage and quality issues on US artisan cheese production. In a survey of 61 cheesemakers, the most common issues reported were undesirable surface molds (71%) and incorrect or unexpected colors or pigments on rinds (54%). When asked, 18% of participants indicated that they were extremely concerned about quality and spoilage problems, and they indicated that their quality standards are frequently not met, either annually (39%) or monthly (33%). Although most of the respondents (62%) said that just 0 to 5% of their cheese was lost or rendered less valuable due to quality issues annually, a small number (7% combined) reported large losses of 20 to 30% or >30% of their product lost or rendered less valuable. Almost all respondents (95%) agreed that improved quality would reduce waste, increase profits, and improve production. The survey respondents indicated in open response questions that they want access to more online resources related to quality issues and digital forums to discuss issues with experts and peers when problems arise. These findings represent the first attempt to document and estimate the effect of quality and spoilage on the American artisan cheese industry. Future work should investigate what technologies, interventions, or information could reduce losses from these problems.

J		Biao Lu; Fangkai Han; Aheto, J. H.; Marwan M. A. Rashed; Zhenggao Pan							Artificial bionic taste sensors coupled with chemometrics for rapid detection of beef adulteration.		Food Science & Nutrition					The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential of taste sensors coupled with chemometrics for rapid determination of beef adulteration. A total of 228 minced meat samples were prepared and analyzed via raw ground beef mixed separately with chicken, duck, and pork in the range of 0 ~ 50% by weight at 10% intervals. Total sugars, protein, fat, and ash contents were also measured to validate the differences between raw meats. For sensing the water-soluble chemicals in the meats, an electronic tongue based on multifrequency large-amplitude pulses and six metal electrodes (platinum, gold, palladium, tungsten, titanium, and silver) was employed. Fisher linear discriminant analysis (Fisher LDA) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to model the identification of raw and the adulterated meats. While an adulterant was detected, the level of adulteration was predicted using partial least squares (PLS) and ELM and the results compared. The results showed that superior recognition models derived from ELM were obtained, as the recognition rates for the independent samples in different meat groups were all over 90%; ELM models were more precisely than PLS models for prediction of the adulteration levels of beef mixed with chicken, duck, and pork, with root mean squares error for the independent samples of 0.33, 0.18, and 0.38% and coefficients of variance of 0.914, 0.956, and 0.928, respectively. The results suggested that taste sensors combined with ELM could be useful in the rapid detection of beef adulterated with other meats. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Biao Tang; Yan Ma; Xiangxiang He; Qinyi Zhou; Jiang Chang; Mingrong Qian; Xiaodong Xia; Hua Yang							Similar antimicrobial resistance of Escherichia coli strains isolated from retail chickens and poultry farms.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major public health challenge and spreads through humans, animals, and the environment. Many reports show that AMR genes (ARGs) or phenotypes can be transferred from food animals to humans. However, the level and correlation of AMR in different nodes of the poultry meat supply chain are still poorly understood. Herein, 225 Escherichia coli isolates were recovered from chilled chicken samples from markets (123) and chicken fecal samples from farms (102) in Zhejiang Province, China. The dominant sequence types (STs) were ST155 (8.89%), ST48 (7.56%), and ST10 (7.11%), which are common in chicken and fecal samples. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) analysis showed that the E. coli isolates from fecal samples and retail chickens were resistant to ampicillin (61.77% and 63.42%, respectively) and trimethoprim (56.87% and 52.85%). Moreover, 36.59% of the E. coli isolates from chilled chickens and 39.22% of the isolates from fecal samples were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents. A total of 59 ARGs were identified in sequenced E. coli genomes, including the mcr-1 gene involved in colistin resistance. The E. coli from farms and markets could be clustered in the same branch according to core single nucleotide polymorphisms. In addition, toxin genes astA and hlyE were also predicted in 86.5% (32/37) and 13.5% (5/37) of the above genomes, respectively. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that E. coli isolates from markets and farms showed similar AMR patterns, suggesting that E. coli strains in markets may originate from farms.										2021	18	7	489	496	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2021.0019					FSTA:2021-11-Sn6565
J		Bicer, Y.; Telli, A. E.; Sonmez, G.; Telli, N.; Ucar, G.							Comparison of microbiota and volatile organic compounds in milk from different sheep breeds.		Journal of Dairy Science					In this study, we compared the microbiota and volatile organic compounds (VOC) present in the milk obtained from 3 different sheep breeds, namely Merino, Lacaune, and Assaf. Udder milk was collected from 21 animals, 7 from each breed. Bacterial microflora was determined metagenomically by extracting the DNA from the milk and analyzing the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method was used to analyze VOC. The metagenomic analysis revealed (for Merino, Lacaune, and Assaf milk, respectively) Firmicutes (66.32, 69.36, and 57.08%), Actinobacteria (19.09, 7.67, and 19.40%), Proteobacteria (13.76, 21.06, and 22.19%), and Bacteroidetes (0.84, 1.91, and 1.33%) phyla in the milk samples. Lactobacillus was highly abundant in the milk of 3 breeds (29.64, 43.50, and 18.70%). The genera constituting more than 2% of all bacteria in all groups were Jeotgalicoccus (7.19, 5.34, and 10.77%), Enterococcus (5.18, 9.78, and 3.64%), and Corynebacterium (4.08, 3.00, and 13.44%). A total of 32 different VOC were identified by headspace solid-phase microextration analysis with 9, 30, and 24 different compounds from Merino, Lacaune, and Assaf breeds, respectively. Although ketone was the most abundant compound in Merino milk (71.84%), hydrocarbons were the most detected in Lacaune and Assaf milk (37.18% and 55.42%, respectively). A positive correlation was found between acetone, which was detected at the highest level in all groups, with Salinicoccus, Alloiococcus, Psychrobacter, and Dietzia. In addition, a negative correlation was found between the Lactobacillus genus, detected at the highest level in all groups, with methyl cyclopentane, 3-methylheptane, octane, decane, 3,3-dimethyloctane, and dodecane. Thus, differences were observed in the bacterial microflora and VOC in the sheep milk from different breeds under different feeding and breeding conditions.

J		Biel, W.; Jaroszewska, A.; Stankowski, S.; Sobolewska, M.; Kepinska-Pacelik, J.							Comparison of yield, chemical composition and farinograph properties of common and ancient wheat grains.		European Food Research and Technology					The chemical composition of 4 spring wheat species was analyzed: einkorn (Triticum monococcum) (local cv.), emmer (Triticum dicoccon) (Lamella cv.), spelt (Triticum spelta) (Wirtas cv.), and common wheat (Triticum aestivum) (Rospuda cv.). Mean emmer and einkorn yield was significantly lower than that of common wheat. The analyses of the wheat grain included the content of total protein, crude ash, crude fat, crude fibre, carbohydrates, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, copper, iron, manganese, and zinc. The grains of the tested ancient wheats were richer in protein, lipids, crude fibre, and crude ash than the common wheat grains. The significantly highest levels of crude protein, ether extract, and crude ash were found in einkorn. As the protein concentration in the grain increased, the calcium, magnesium, and potassium levels increased, and the zinc and manganese levels decreased. Genotypic differences between the studied wheats were reflected in the concentrations of the minerals and nutrients, an observation which can be useful in further cross-linkage studies. Dough made from common wheat and spelt flour showed better performance quality classifying it to be used for bread production. In turn, flour from emmer and einkorn wheat may be intended for pastry products, due to short dough development time and constancy as well as high softening. ©The Author(s) 2021.		; Biel, Wioletta/G-7479-2016	Jaroszewska, Anna/0000-0003-1755-4125; Kepinska-Pacelik, Jagoda/0000-0001-5925-0694; Stankowski, Slawomir/0000-0001-8607-7591; Sobolewska, Magdalena/0000-0002-6971-1893; Biel, Wioletta/0000-0002-3385-6281							2021	247	6	1525	1538	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03729-7					FSTA:2021-09-Mj5012

Identifying the food sources of selected minerals for the adult European population among rice and rice products.		Foods					The problem of dietary deficiency of several essential elements among different stages of life is still observed. The consumption of whole grains (among others unprocessed rice) is recommended as a part of a healthy diet. This research aimed to determine the content of selected macro-and microelements in rice and rice products to verify whether the tested products could be regarded as a source of selected minerals in the diet of the adult European population. Methods. A total of 99 samples from 12 groups of rice products (basmati, black, brown, parboiled, red, wild, white rice and expanded rice, rice flakes, flour, pasta, and waffles) were obtained. The atomic absorption spectrometry method (AAS) was used to determine the content of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Se and Zn in the study material. Results. The average measured contents of Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Mn, Se and Zn were as follows: 226.3 160.6 mg/kg, 3.6 2.8 mg/kg, 9.4 7.0 mg/kg, 618.0 498.4 mg/kg, 16.7 10.0 mg/kg, 242.9 140.4 g/kg and 19.5 15.0 mg/kg, respectively. Statistical analyses confirmed the differences in the levels of the studied elements between the subgroups of processed and unprocessed products. Considering the tolerable upper intake level of studied elements, the tested products could be regarded as safe to consume. Conclusion. All tested products can be recommended as a source of Cu, Mn, and Se, while a majority of studied products can be considered a source of Mg and Zn in the diet of the adult European population. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Biernacka, B.; Dziki, D.; Gawlik-Dziki, U.; Rozylo, R.							Common wheat pasta enriched with cereal coffee: quality and physical and functional properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of cereal coffee (CC) on the properties of pasta. The pasta was prepared by the substitution of common wheat flour with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 g/100 g CC. Next, various properties of pasta including texture, colour, cooking properties, sensory analysis, and antioxidant activity were evaluated. CC significantly decreased lightness and increased redness of both raw and cooked pasta. CC reduced optimal cooking time and increased cooking losses of pasta. The addition of 5 g CC/into100 g wheat flour significantly increased the deformation and stretching work of cooked pasta. According to the sensory evaluation of the pasta samples, CC had a positive effect on the smell, taste, and colour of pasta. More importantly, during sensory evaluation, an increased amount of CC resulted in a decrease in adhesiveness of the pasta. Pasta with CC was characterised by a higher total phenolic content and a higher antioxidant capacity. Cooking decreased the amount of total phenolic compounds from 12 to 15%. In summary, we recommend the substitution of CC (up to 4 g/100 g) in common wheat flour for the preparation of pasta. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bifen Zhu; Wangwei Lu; Yuyue Qin; Guiguang Cheng; Minglong Yuan; Lin Li							An intelligent pH indicator film based on cassava starch/polyvinyl alcohol incorporating anthocyanin extracts for monitoring pork freshness.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					An intelligent pH indicator film was prepared by mixing cassava starch, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and natural anthocyanin extracted from grape skin (GSE) and mangosteen rind (MRE). The effects of GSE and MRE on the physical, structural, and pH-sensing performance of composite films were studied. Scanning electron microscope results showed that the microstructure of film had little difference when the anthocyanin extracts were incorporated into the polymer matrix. A significant (p<.05) effect of GSE and MRE on the tensile strength, moisture content, and elongation at the break of the films were observed. The two indicator films could respond to different pH values and showed good color stability. During the storage of pork, the cassava starch/PVA/GSE film showed a visible color variation from pink, blue, purple to yellow, while the cassava starch/PVA/MRE film showed color variation from light yellow, bright yellow, green to dark green. The result indicated that the two films could be used to monitor pork freshness for intelligent pH indicator packaging. Novelty impact statement. Using fruit waste to extract anthocyanin. Indicator film has good color stability, and the color change was obvious at different pH values. The color of the indicator film changed obviously in the process of indicating the freshness of pork. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15822					FSTA:2022-01-Sj0340
J		Bifen Zhu; Chunli Fan; Chunsheng Cheng; Tianqin Lan; Lin Li; Yuyue Qin							Migration kinetic of silver from polylactic acid nanocomposite film into acidic food simulant after different high-pressure food processing.		Journal of Food Science					The migration study of nano-Ag migration from polylactic acid (PLA) films was studied. Samples treated by high-pressure food processing (0, 100, 200, 300, and 400 MPa pressure) were soaked in acetic acid solution and incubated at 20 °C for 90 days. At the end of storage, nano-Ag particles (AgNPs) migration from the PLA/AgNPs composite film treated under 200 MPa high pressure was the lowest. However, AgNPs migration was accelerated under 400 MPa high pressure. High-pressure processing (200 MPa) could cause denser structure and higher crystallinity degree in films than other treatments. Lower amount of AgNPs induced a decline in the intensity of specific characteristic peaks. The diffraction peak intensity of alpha-crystal for the film sample treated with 400 MPa was the lowest on day 60. The crystallization index of the PLA matrix changed with different high-pressure processing. The result indicated that appropriate high-pressure food processing could effectively suppress AgNPs migration from PLA-based film while contacting with acidic acid food simulant. Practical Application. The release of nanoparticles from food packaging material is a very important matter when the migration is concerned with regulatory and toxicity issues. The study described the migration kinetic of AgNPs from PLA nanocomposite film into acidic food simulant after different high-pressure food processing. The results indicated that the PLA/AgNPs nanocomposite film was safe for acidic food after high-pressure treatment. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	6	2481	2490	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15746					FSTA:2021-10-Cf3022
J		Bighaghire, R.; Okidi, L.; Muggaga, C.; Ongeng, D.							Traditional vegetable preservation technologies practiced in Acholi subregion of Uganda improves mineral bioavailability but impacts negatively on the contribution of vegetables to household needs for micronutrients.		Food Science & Nutrition					The impact of traditional African preservation methods on the contribution of vegetables to household micronutrient needs (Recommended Dietary Allowance: RDA) has largely remained unquantified. Using Acholi subregion of Uganda as a case area, this study examined using the predominant vegetables consumed in fresh and preserved forms (cowpeas-Vigna unguicullata, okra/lady fingers-Abelmoschus esculentus, Malakwang-Hibscus cannabinus, and eggplants-Solanum melongena), the effect of major traditional vegetable preservation methods (sun drying, boiling and sun drying, and salting and sun drying) on the contents of micronutrients (vitamin A, iron, zinc, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus), the levels of antinutritional factors (total polyphenols, oxalate, tannins, and phytate), bioavailability of iron and zinc, and the contribution of vegetables to the cumulative annual household RDA for micronutrients. Laboratory analysis showed that all the preservation methods, except the sun drying method reduced the contents of micronutrients by 20%-82% (p ≤.05). The contents of antinutritional factors reduced by 1%-80% while in vitro bioavailability of iron and zinc increased by 21%-296% (p ≤.05). Nutritional computation revealed that except for calcium, the preservation methods combined, reduced the contribution of the vegetables to cumulative annual RDA for other micronutrients by 28%-60%. These results demonstrate that improvements in bioavailability of essential nutrients (iron and zinc) by traditional preservation methods investigated are associated with significant loss of micronutrients which culminates in significant reduction in the contribution of cultivated vegetables to household RDA for micronutrients.

Characterization of chitosan-hydroxypropyl methylcellulose blend films enriched with nettle or sage leaf extract for active food packaging applications.		Food Hydrocolloids					The incorporation of plant leaf extracts into biodegradable food packaging materials is a promising green approach to develop active films with antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. In this context, this study aimed to develop active films based on chitosan/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose blend (CS/HPMC) enriched with sage (SLE) and nettle (NLE) leaf extracts (7.5-15% w/w of biopolymer) to characterize their surface and cross-section morphology, optical, mechanical, water barrier, and antioxidant properties for food packaging applications. Scanning electron microscopy confirmed microstructural integrity and compatibility between CS and HPMC and incorporated leaf extracts. The successful incorporation of plant extracts was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Active films showed improvement in UV-Vis light barrier properties (p < 0.05) with opacity value lower than five. Addition of leaf extracts induced a slightly darker color by inducing a green and yellow shade. Addition of NLE increased the water solubility and water vapor permeability compared to the control film (p < 0.05). Total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were increased upon addition of leaf extracts. Overall, CS/HPMC films incorporated with SLE and NLE could be employed as a green alternative for partial substitution of synthetic plastics with antioxidant activity and to prolong the shelf-life of food products.

Impact of low-dose gaseous ozone treatment to reduce the growth of in vitro broth cultures of foodborne pathogenic/spoilage bacteria in a food storage cold chamber.		Journal of Food Safety					Cold storage coupled with gaseous ozone represents a potential strategy to reduce or inhibit the presence of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in a food storage cold chamber. This study aims to evaluate the impact of gaseous ozone treatment (0.05ppm at exposure times of 30 and 60min) on the bacterial contamination of internal surface and air in a cold chamber (3 °C) intended for food storage. The bacterial load of internal surfaces was reduced by 0.99 0.24 and 1.35 0.27 log after 30 and 60min ozone treatment, respectively. Airborne bacterial load was reduced by 0.93 0.24 log after 30min ozone treatment and became non-detectable after 60min. Gaseous ozone treatments (0.05ppm at exposure times of 1, 2, 6, 24, 30, and 48hr) of the cold chamber were investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of this technology against Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, Campylobacter jejuni, and Pseudomonas fluorescens cultured in broth cultures. Ozone treatment was effective against C. jejuni since the population at the highest concentration of inoculum (3.34 log CFU/plate) was reduced by 2.23 log after 1 hr and it was completely undetectable after 2 hr. S. enterica and E. coli showed the highest resistance to short ozone treatment since 6 hr treatment did not show antibacterial activity whereas after 24hr treatment around 2 log reduction was observed for both pathogens. Short ozone treatment did not affect L. monocytogenes viability. P. fluorescens showed high sensitivity to short treatments, with 0.75-1.32 log reductions after 1 hr and further 0.22-0.53 log reductions after 6 hr. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Multivariate exploratory data analysis by PCA of the combined effect of film-forming composition, drying conditions, and UV-C irradiation on the functional properties of films based on chitosan and pectin.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The technical features of biodegradable films depend on several manufacturing parameters. Exploiting these films on an industrial basis requires statistical models for the fast and effective evaluation of these parameters. This study analyses the impact of compositional and drying factors on the microstructural and functional properties of films based on chitosan and pectin through a multivariate approach. A total of 32 formulations were developed and the results were analysed through principal component analysis (PCA). Four formulations did not form films due to the photodegradation caused by prolonged UV-C irradiation. Films containing glycerol had a higher elasticity (1.5-39%) than those with propylene glycol or that were not plasticized (1.2-12%). Glycerol increased the thickness of pectin films (56-77 mum). Sodium trimethaphosphate (STMP) enhanced the UV mean absorbance of both pectin and chitosan films (0.7-1.7). In addition, STMP led to an increase of thickness (72-129 mum) and air permeability (38.6*103 to 9206.1*103 cm3/m2*day*kPa) of the chitosan films, while CaCl2 led to a decrease of thickness (31-59 mum) and air permeability (23.9*103 to 46.8*103 cm3/m2*day*kPa) of the pectin films.

J		Bigne, F.; Romero, A.; Ferrero, C.; Puppo, M. C.; Guerrero, A.							New thermal and rheological approaches of chickpea-wheat dough for breadmaking.		European Food Research and Technology					Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is a legume of Fabaceae family whose grains are rich in proteins, total dietary fiber, unsaturated lipids, minerals and bioactive compounds with antioxidant activity. Therefore, chickpea flour can be an attractive high nutritional complement to wheat flour for the formulation of composite breads. In the present study, the thermal and rheological characteristics of the chickpea-wheat dough obtained by replacement of wheat flour with 100 and 200 g/Kg of chickpea flour were assessed by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Rapid Visco Analysis (RVA), Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMA) and Texture Profile Analysis (TPA). Higher gelatinization temperatures in coincidence with higher pasting temperatures with lower breakdown and setback of the pastes were obtained for the chickpea-wheat mixtures. Furthermore, the viscoelasticity of the wheat dough changed with the presence of chickpea flour, leading to higher dynamic moduli (E′, E) and lower values of tangent of the phase angle (tan delta= E′/ E) suggesting the formation of a more elastic matrix. At higher deformations (TPA), higher values of hardness and elasticity were observed. These changes were associated with a marked disruption of the gluten network by the presence of certain chickpea components like proteins, assessed by different microscopic techniques. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Bikaki, M.; Shah, R.; Muller, A.; Kuhnert, N.							Heat induced hydrolytic cleavage of the peptide bond in dietary peptides and proteins in food processing.		Food Chemistry					We investigate the hypothesis that proteins and peptides are thermally degraded by hydrolytic bond cleavage of amide bonds, hence yielding shorter peptides as main degradation products. A series of fifteen pentapeptides with varying sequences was subjected to heating. Products were investigated by targeted UHPLC-ESI-tandem mass spectrometry and targeted analysis revealed formation of 2,5-diketopiperazines, di-and tri-peptides. Relative quantities of the thermal degradation were determined to show that hydrolytic cleavage is an important, however not dominant degradation pathway. A series of dietary intact proteins were subjected to heating and products formed analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. For the majority of proteins larger degradation products with m/ z values between 900 and 2500 could be observed, which we tentatively assign as hydrolytic cleavage products. For coffee globulin a series of eleven short peptides formed through thermal hydrolytic cleavage could be unambiguously identified formed through thermal proteolysis. The identical products could as well be identified in samples of roasted coffee clearly illustrating the occurrence and relevance of thermally induced proteolysis of proteins.

J		Bikash Adhikari; Manjul Dutt; Tripti Vashisth							Comparative phytochemical analysis of the fruits of four Florida-grown finger lime (Citrus australasica) selections.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Finger lime (Citrus australasica F. Muell.), a citrus species native to Australia, is a distinct finger-shaped fruit with unique caviar-like pulp and skin color variations. In addition to visual and sensory characteristics, finger lime has recently gained attention from the American citrus industry due to its tolerance to a devastating citrus disease, Huanglongbing (HLB). Here, we characterized the phytochemical profiles (including acid and sugar) of four Florida-grown finger lime selections: two with red pulp, one with pale pink pulp, and one with white pulp. Two-three-fold higher levels of phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity were observed in the peel compared to the pulp in the four selections. Selections with red pulp had more antioxidant capacity and higher phenolic compound content in both types of tissues than in the selections with white pulp. Citric acid was found abundant in all four selections making the selections a major source of organic acid. The overall results suggested that finger limes are rich in health-benefiting and flavor contributing compounds; more specifically, Florida-grown red selections of finger lime are richest in phytochemicals, vitamin c, citric acid, and sugars among evaluated genotypes, therefore, making them strong alternative for production in Florida and consumption.

J		Bikila, A. M.; Tola, Y. B.; Esho, T. B.; Forsido, S. F.							Drying behavior of anchote (Coccinia abyssinica [Lam.] Cogn.) tuber slices as affected by predrying treatments and drying temperature.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study was carried out to evaluate the effect of pretreatment and temperature on the drying behavior of anchote (Coccinia abyssinica [Lam.] Cogn.) tuber slices. It was examined by scheming moisture loss during drying process as a function of time. Ten selected thin layer drying models were evaluated based on R2, x2, and root mean square error (RMSE). Effective moisture diffusivity (Deff) and energy of activation (Ea) were estimated from the drying data. The result showed that the drying process exhibited a single falling rate. Both pretreatment and temperature affected drying kinetics. Page model was the most suitable model fitting the drying kinetics (R2=0.9934-0.9999). Deff values were ranged in 3.7*10-8-1.3*10-7 m2/s. Ea for raw, blanched, and boiled slices were 56.3, 63.6, and 86.1 kJ/mol, respectively. Energy needed to initiate drying process in boiled anchote slices was higher. Novelty impact statement. The drying kinetics of anchote slices exhibited a single falling rate and is affected by pretreatment and drying temperature with optimum temperature of 65 °C to attain the intended drying rate for pretreated samples. Activation energy required to initiate the drying process in the pretreated slices was higher compared with the raw. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of micro-aeration on the mechanical behaviour of chocolates and implications for oral processing.		Food & Function					Aeration in foods has been widely utilised in the food industry to develop novel foods with enhanced sensorial characteristics. Specifically, aeration at the micron-sized scale has a significant impact on the microstructure where micro-bubbles interact with the other microstructural features in chocolates. This study aims to determine the effect of micro-aeration on the mechanical properties of chocolate products, which are directly correlated with textural attributes such as hardness and crumbliness. Uniaxial compression tests were performed to determine the mechanical properties such as Poisson's ratio, Young's modulus and macroscopic yield strength together with fracture tests to estimate the fracture toughness. In vivo mastication tests were also conducted to investigate the link between the fracture properties and fragmentation during the first two chewing cycles. The uniaxial stress-strain data were used to calibrate a viscoplastic constitutive law. The results showed that micro-aeration significantly affects mechanical properties such as Young's modulus, yield and fracture stresses, as well as fracture toughness. In addition, it enhances the brittle nature of the chocolate, as evidenced by lower fracture stress but also lower fracture toughness leading to higher fragmentation, in agreement with observations in the in vivo mastication tests. As evidenced by the XRT images and the stress-strain measurements micro-aeration hinders the re-arrangement of the microscopic features inside the chocolate during the material's deformation. The work provides a new insight of the role of bubbles on the bulk behaviour of complex multiphase materials, such as chocolates, and defines the mechanical properties which are important input parameters for the development of oral processing simulations. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Bikouli, V. C.; Doulgeraki, A. I.; Skandamis, P. N.							Culture-dependent PCR-DGGE-based fingerprinting to trace fishing origin or storage history of gilthead seabream.		Food Control					Fish is among the most perishable foods, with spoilage symptoms associated with undesirable growth of microorganisms to unacceptable levels. In the case of seabream, Pseudomonas and Shewanella species are established as the main spoilage organisms. The aim of the present work was to assess gilthead seabreams freshness based on quantitative and qualitative (genetic fingerprinting) microbiological data, assuming that the presence of specific microorganisms, can be used as a potential (taxa) marker of freshness, fishing origin as well as of whether fish has been frozen or not. Freshly caught fish (max. 8 h after catching) from 4 different Greek sea areas (i.e.Euboea, Saronikos, Argolida and Phthiotis) were analyzed with classical microbiological methods before and during storage at 0 °C for 16 days and at -18 °C for 18 months. The presence of specific microorganisms in fish was monitored using PCR-DGGE. Regarding the classical microbiological analysis, results showed that Pseudomonas, H2S-producing and non H2S-producing microorganisms were the dominant microbiota of freshly caught and chilled or frozen stored fish. Enterobacteriaceae community grown on plates incubated at 7 °C for 10 days, was found 1-3 log units higher than those on plates incubated at 37 °C. After 16 days of storage at 0 °C, the dominant populations on freshly caught fish, reached the level of 6-7 log CFU g-1. DGGE analysis revealed that the microbiota of seabream was influenced by the fishing area and storage conditions. In general, Pseudomonas, Shewanella, Psychrobacter and Arthrobacter were detected in the majority of cases (including fresh fish), regardless of the fishing area, suggesting a significant contribution to fish microbiota. Moreover, genera Stenotrophomonas, Massilia, and Microbacterium were associated with seabream from Saronikos area stored at 0 °C. Similarly, Hafnia was detected on seabream from Euboea, Argolida and Phthiotis stored under the same conditions. Other genera were also associated with the microbiota of seabream caught from Euboea i.e.Moraxella, Rahnella and Sphingobacterium, or Argolida region i.e.Brochothrix, Enhydrobacter, Lactobacillus and Vagococcus. In conclusion, the detection of specific microorganisms could serve as potential indication of freshness, fishing origin and storage history of the fish. However, a follow up metataxonomic culture-independent study could be useful to strengthen and confirm the results of this research. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bikram Gautam							Microbiological quality assessment (including antibiogram and threat assessment) of bottled water.		Food Science & Nutrition					Water pollution is a major global problem that has been the leading cause of morbidity and mortality. This study was carried out to assess the microbiological quality of popular domestic brands of bottled water available in the Kathmandu Valley in Nepal. For the study of bottled water, a total of 50 samples each of different volumes (20 and 1 L) were selected. The samples were processed at the Microbiology laboratory at St. Xavier's College, Maitighar, Kathmandu. The microbiological assessments were performed as per the methods described in the American Public Health Association, 2005. Out of 100 samples, 48% of samples were found to be contaminated with total coliform. Escherichia coli was the predominant strain among the coliforms. Multidrug-resistant E. coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated from the 48 bottled water. Treat assessment test revealed that 88.23% of the isolated E. coli produced beta hemolytic colonies, while 11.77% did not show hemolytic colonies, 100% E. aerogenes colonies were not able to develop hemolytic colonies and 100%, P. aeruginosa colonies gave beta hemolytic colonies, respectively. Chi-square test shows that there is a significant association (p ≤.05) between fecal coliform and volume of the vessel (i.e., 20 and 1 L), bottle type (i.e., unscratched and undented and scratched and/or dented), season (i.e., monsoon and postmonsoon), and total coliform. Chi-square test shows that there is no significant (p>.05) association between Pseudomonas spp and season (i.e., monsoon and postmonsoon). Out of 100 samples, 48% of samples were found to be contaminated with total coliform. Microorganisms survive in bottled water as they have many nutrients required for the microorganism in ionic form. Surveillance is lacking by the license-providing organizations followed by governmental organizations. © 2021 The Authors.

Essential and potentially toxic elements in raw milk from different geographical regions of Croatia and their health risk assessment in the adult population.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Concentrations of selected elements were measured in raw cow milk collected from four geographical regions in Croatia. The highest mean concentrations of Al, Ba, Fe and Zn were measured in milk from Central Croatia. Milk from the Croatian Littoral and Mountain region showed the highest mean content of Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb. The highest mean concentrations of As and Se were found in milk from Southern Croatia, while Mn had the highest values in Eastern Croatia. Mercury was not determined above the detection limit in any samples. Significant differences in the concentrations of Al, Ba, Se and Zn were found among the regions. A decrease in the Pb content was recorded compared to previous research in milk in Croatia. Estimation of the potential harmful effects of toxic and trace elements through milk consumption by comparing the established highest mean with toxicological limits showed low exposure with regard to Al, As, Ba, Cr, Cu, Hg, Fe, Ni, Se, Pb and Zn in adult populations in Croatia. The only exception was Cd concentrations in milk, which gave a higher contribution to toxicological limits, especially for consumers consuming greater quantities of milk per week.

Dietary exposure of the adult croatian population to meat, liver and meat products from the Croatian market: health risk assessment.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This is a comprehensive study of the macronutrient, toxic and non-essential element concentrations in 22 meat, liver and meat products from the Croatian market. The highest mean content of Fe, Mn, Zn and Mo were measured in pork liver, while Ag, Co, Cu and V were highest in bovine liver. Pates contain the highest concentrations of Al, Ba, Cd, Ni and Se, while salami products had the highest As, Ca, Cr, K and Pb. Pork meat and pork canned products contained the highest Hg and Mg levels. Using the tolerable daily intake for Cu, Fe, and Zn, and minimal risk levels for Se to check for potential risk, higher exposure was found only in the case of P95 consumers for Fe in liver and Se in meat products. Also, P95 consumers face an exposure to risk since the concentrations of Cd and Co in liver and of Al and Cd in meat products exceeded the toxicological limits. Meat, liver and meat products can be considered safe for adult consumers based on the low contributions to toxicological limits for As, Ba, Cr, Hg, Ni and Pb.

Preservation of grape tomato by isochoric freezing.		Food Research International					This study investigated the potential of isochoric freezing to preserve tomatoes. Isochoric freezing is an emerging technology that preserves biological matter at subfreezing temperatures without any ice damage. Isochoric freezing was compared with freezing under isobaric conditions and with preservation techniques used in the food industry: cold storage at 10 °C and individual quick freezing (IQF). Physicochemical and nutritional properties were evaluated weekly for four weeks. Preservation under isochoric conditions maintained the mass, color, nutrient content (ascorbic acid, lycopene and phenolics) and antioxidant activity of the fresh tomatoes. Also, isochoric preservation led to minimal texture damage. In comparison, mass loss of tomatoes stored at 10 °C for 3 weeks contributed to changes in overall visual quality and firmness as well as significant losses in nutrient content. The greatest mass, texture, and nutrients losses were obtained for tomatoes subjected to IQF and isobaric freezing. The results show that isochoric freezing has the potential to preserve tomatoes while maintaining physicochemical and nutritional properties similar to those of fresh tomatoes which might find application in the commercial preservation of tomatoes.

Foods					This study explores drivers of fast-food consumption in Romania using the Theory of Planned Behavior. We analyze 532 responses to an online survey and use partial least squares path modeling to estimate the relationships between the intention to consume fast food and its possible determinants. Our results show that the most significant predictor is the subjective norms (injunctive norms: beta=0.218, p< 0.001; descriptive norms: beta=0.192, p< 0.001). Among the affective and cognitive attitudes, only the latter is statistically significant in predicting the intention (beta=0.088, p=0.020), while perceived behavioral control is not significantly associated with intention toward fast-food consumption. We explain how our results can help policymakers to design better interventions on public health concerns about fast-food consumption and population obesity, especially children obesity. © 2021 by the authors.

Daily and within-feed variation of macro- and trace-element concentrations in human milk and implications for sampling.		Food Chemistry					Background. Daily variations of macro-and trace-elements in human milk (HM) are not well characterised and sampling protocols are highly variable between studies. Objectives. To investigate diurnal and within-feed variation of HM macro-and trace-elements using pre-and post-feed concentrations and to compare infant intake estimates using limited samples with measured 24-hour intake. Methods. HM Samples were collected pre-and post-every feed in a 24-hour period from 11 mother-infant dyads. Test-weighing was used to determine the volume of HM consumed in each feed. For macro-and trace-elements within-feed and daily variation was measured. Intake estimated from a morning pre-feed sample was compared to the measured milk intake calculated from every feed over 24-hours. Macro-and trace-elements concentrations were measured using ICP-MS. Linear mixed modelling was used for statistical analysis. Results. Average intake of HM was 73763 mL for infants aged 1-6 months and 50850 for infants aged 6-12 months. Pre-and post-feed HM variation was found for phosphorus, calcium, manganese, iron, copper, zinc, selenium, molybdenum, and iodine (p < 0.05). Variation across 24 h was found for magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, manganese, iron, and selenium (p < 0.05). Estimated intake using morning, pre-feed samples resulted in significantly lower intake when compared to measured milk intake for iron, phosphorus, selenium, and manganese (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Standardised sampling protocols using large sample volumes and multiple collections over 24-hours provide a calculated intake that is more reflective of actual infant HM macro-and trace-elements intake.

Physicochemical parameters, bioactive compounds, and antibacterial potential of stingless bee honey.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Analysis of physicochemical parameters, phenolic compounds, total reducing capacity, free radical scavenging, and antimicrobial potential was performed in 14 samples of honey from six different species of stingless bees from Brazil. The results of the physicochemical properties showed high moisture (24.28%-38.20% wt/wt), free acidity above 50 meq/kg for most honey samples, reducing sugars ranging from 58.79% to 73.01% (wt/wt), 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) below the limit of quantification (0.074 mg/L), diastase activity from <3 to 70.91 Gothe units, and electrical conductivity values varying from 0.13 to 0.84 mS cm-1. In addition, 12 phenolic compounds were quantified, being taxifolin (-1) and syringaldehyde (-1) the compounds that presented the higher concentrations. The results also showed that the honey has reducing capacity, free radical-scavenging activity and, presents potential growth inhibitor of Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus. Stingless bee honey can be pointed out as a peculiar product with antioxidants and antibacterial properties. Practical applications. The Meliponinae form a large group of bees that lack a sting and are found among various tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The honey produced by these bees is a peculiar product due to its physical, chemical, and sensorial characteristics. For these aspects, this honey has been being valued in the world market, and studies about its composition have been conducted. However, the huge variety of species of stingless bee results in honeys with diverse composition, being influenced also by the climate, soil characteristics, flowers, and geographical regions. For this reason, having the knowledge about the composition of honeys from different regions, species, or origins can help in the standardization and regulation of this honey (regulations are nonexistent yet), being able to expand its world market. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Influences of freeze- and spray-drying vs. encapsulation with soy and whey proteins on gastrointestinal stability and antioxidant activity of Mediterranean aromatic herbs.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The aim of the present research was to study the chemical profile of volatile and non-volatile compounds in freeze-and spray-dried oregano, thyme, sage, and rosemary as well as to study the gastrointestinal stability and the biological activity of the samples after encapsulation using two proteins (soy and whey). Chemical analysis was performed by HS-SPME/GC-MS and HPLC-PDA techniques. The antioxidant activity (FRAP, DPPH and ORAC assays) and HPLC-PDA analyses were performed before and after simulated two-phase digestion process (gastric and duodenal) using human gastrointestinal enzymes. The effect of protein carriers was depended on the plant matrix and the class of compound. Soy protein is useful for the protection of thymol and carvacrol content in thyme and the increase of the antioxidant activity of sage. Whey protein is useful for flavanols stability in all studied herbs before and after the duodenal digestive phase. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Bimal Chitrakar; Min Zhang; Bhesh Bhandari							Improvement strategies of food supply chain through novel food processing technologies during COVID-19 pandemic.		Food Control					Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a novel corona virus (SARS-CoV-2). No medical intervention has yet succeeded, though vaccine success is expected soon. However, it may take months or years to reach the vaccine to the whole population of the world. Therefore, the technological preparedness is worth to discuss for the smooth running of food processing activities. We have explained the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the food supply chain (FSC) and then discussed the technological interventions to overcome these impacts. The novel and smart technologies during food processing to minimize human-to-human and human-to-food contact were compiled. The potential virus-decontamination technologies were also discussed. Finally, we concluded that these technologies would make food processing activities smarter, which would ultimately help to run the FSC smoothly during COVID-19 pandemic.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In this study, the preventive effect of tangeretin (TAN), a natural flavonoid derivative from citrus fruits, on the dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in mice was evaluated. Our results showed that dietary TAN (0.04% and 0.08% w/w in the diet) significantly reduced the severity of colitis caused by DSS treatment in mice, evidenced by the increased colon length, the reduced disease activity index, and the attenuated colonic tissue damages. Moreover, dietary TAN inhibited the inflammatory response via down-regulating the overexpression of colonic inflammatory cytokines. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the intestinal barrier function was restored by TAN through enhancing claudin-1 and ZO-1 expressions. Additionally, dietary TAN modulated gut microbiota in colitic mice via enhancing gut microbiota diversity, ascending the level of beneficial bacteria, e.g., Lachnospiraceae and Lactobacillaceae, and descending the level of harmful bacteria, e.g., Enterobacteriaceae and Alistipes. Besides, dietary TAN promoted short-chain fatty acids production in DSS-treated mice. Altogether, these findings provided scientific evidence for the rational utilization of TAN as a preventive agent against colonic inflammation and related diseases.										2021	69	27	7663	7674	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03046					FSTA:2021-11-Jc15210

Journal of Functional Foods					Chronic and excessive alcohol consumption can lead to the development of alcoholic liver disease (ALD), which is characterized by oxidative damage, inflammation, and impaired intestinal barrier function. To evaluate the effect of exopolysaccharides (EPS) from Sporidiobolus pararoseus on ALD, alcohol was used in this study to cause liver damage in mice. Then, the antioxidant and anti-inflammation activities and protective effect of EPS on the intestinal barrier function were further explored in an ALD model. The results show that the histopathological change and liver injury were significantly improved in the EPS group. EPS treatment significantly increased the levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) (P < 0.05), and weak reduced the elevation of malondialdehyde (MDA) induced by ALD. Several inflammatory markers, including tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1beta were reduced significantly after the intervention by EPS (P < 0.01). In addition, EPS also inhibited the injury of the small intestine and regulated the intestinal barrier function. A mechanism study shows that EPS restrained oxidative stress and protected intestinal barrier function by activating Nrf2/HO-1/PPAR-gamma signaling pathway and upregulating the expression of ZO-1 and occludin, indicating that EPS showed protective activity against ALD through the gut-hepatic axis. Therefore, EPS has potential as a protective agent against ALD. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	87				1756-4646				10.1016/j.jff.2021.104737					FSTA:2022-04-Ha2890

Foods					Nutritional knowledge, attitudes and practice (KAP) may guide healthy meal choices. Here, nutritional KAP was compared across school students in Sabah based on locality and gender. A cross-sectional survey of students aged 15-19 years was conducted using multistage sampling. Nutritional KAP was measured via questionnaire. Anthropometric measures of weight and height were taken in person to calculate body mass index (BMI). Among the 994 participants, 80% were urban and 60% were female (mean age 16.50.6 yr). Most were of Kadazan-Dusun (23%) ethnicity. Measured height for age Z score (HAZ) and BMI for age Z score (BAZ) differed between urban and rural students (-1.20.8 versus -1.50.7 for HAZ; p< 0.001; 0.21.4 versus -0.11.3; p=0.02, respectively). No difference in nutritional knowledge was found, although urban students prioritized having a healthy/balanced diet (59.55% versus 48.50%, p=0.03) and ate daily breakfast (57.4% versus 10.2%, p< 0.001) compared to rural. Females scored higher on nutritional knowledge than males (18.92.8 vs. 18.13.4, respectively, p=0.0001), yet males selected more healthy/balanced foods (63.3% versus 53.3%, p=0.041). The gap remains between nutritional KAP and translating this to healthy eating among adolescents, related to locality and gender. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La) is of great interest to the industry as a result of its excellent functional properties and nutritional value. Aqueous two-phase flotation (ATPF) of thermo-sensitive polymer poly (ethylene glycol-ran-propylene glycol) monobutyl ether (UCON) and KH2PO4 was applied to directly separate and purify alpha-La from milk whey, which was purposed to simplify the production process and reduced cost of production. Results. The effect of ATPF composition and operating parameters on the flotation efficiency (E) and purity of alpha-La were investigated. The optimal conditions included 2 min of premixing time, 30mLmin-1 flow velocity and 20min of flotation time, whereas the composition conditions comprised 35.0 mL 0.18gmL-1 phosphate solution (containing 10% (cow milk whey/salt solution, v/v) cow milk whey, 50ppm defoamer and 2 g NaCl) and 5.0 mL of 40% (w/w) UCON solution. Under the optimal conditions, E of alpha-La was 95.671.04% and purity of alpha-La was 98.781.19%. UCON was recovered by a thermally-induced phase separation and reused in next ATPF process without reducing E of alpha-La. Purified alpha-La was characterized by several key technologies. The results indicated that alpha-La in cow milk whey could be directly separated and purified by the ATPF and the purity was satisfactory. Moreover, it was suggested there was no obvious structure difference between the alpha-La separated by ATPF and the alpha-La standard. Conclusion. The present study enabled the recycling of UCON, providing an effective, economically viable and environmentally friendly approach for the separation and purification of protein. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	10	4173	4182	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11055					FSTA:2021-10-Pe5193

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Exopolysaccharides of Lactobacillus plantarum (LAB EPS) have become a research focus due to their health-promoting properties. The purpose of this study was to develop a highly efficient and simple separation technology for LAB EPS. A simple aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) based on polyethylene glycol (PEG)/NaH2PO4 was first applied to isolate exopolysaccharides from Lactobacillus plantarum 1.0665. The distribution behavior of LAB EPS derived from the ATPS was studied using a single-factor test combined with the response surface method. Effective separation of LAB EPS was achieved by ATPS consisting of 22.5% PEG 600 (w/w) and 17.0% NaH2PO4 (w/w) at pH=6.0, with a K of 5.210.05 and a Y of 71.570.39%. The structural characteristics of the obtained LAB EPS were subsequently examined. The LAB EPS had a molecular weight of 95276 Da, consisting of mannose, glucose and galactose at molar ratios of 1.00,0.65 and 0.20, respectively. An ordered helical conformation maintained by hydrogen bonding interactions was identified in the LAB EPS molecules. The biological activity assay revealed significant antioxidant activity, anti-gout activity and hypoglycemic activity of LAB EPS. In addition, LAB EPS was kinetically characterized as a competitive inhibitor of alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase.

J		Bin Liu; Yan Li; Zhongna Cao; Chunling Wang							Effect of Tetragenococcus halophilus, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, and Torulopsis versatilis addition sequence on soy sauce fermentation.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect that the sequences of ingredient addition had on soy sauce fermentation. Five strategies were assessed for the inoculation of Tetragenococcus halophilus, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, and Torulopsis versatilis. The results of physicochemical analysis and levels of flavor compounds demonstrated that the best strategy for soy sauce fermentation was to inoculate T. halophilus (2 * 105 CFU/mL) on the 15th day, Z. rouxii (1.0 * 106 CFU/mL) on the 30th day, and T. versatilis (1.0 * 106 CFU/mL) on the 45th day; this enhanced its fruity, sauce, alcoholic, and caramel-like flavors by 64.3%, 22.7%, 43.1%, and 36.2%, respectively, and saline taste by 64.3%. Spearman correlation analysis revealed the content of ethanol positively correlated with acetic acid (r=0.82) and succinic acid (r=0.80), while the level of formic acid negatively correlated with ethyl phenylacetate (r =-0.88). In summary, these results provided fundamental evidence for strain addition sequence for producing flavor-enhanced soy sauce with potential application in the future.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis) presents an excellent capacity to survive in egg white, which is a hostile environment for bacterial growth. To reveal its survival mechanism, this study focuses on the specific gene SEN1393, which has been found to exist only in the genomic sequence of S. Enteritidis. The survival capacity of the deletion mutant strain DeltaSEN1393 was proven to be significantly reduced after incubation in egg white. RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR results demonstrate that the expression levels of 19 genes were up-regulated, while the expression levels of 9 genes were down-regulated in egg white. These genes were classified into 6 groups based on their functional categories, namely the sulfate assimilation pathway, arginine biosynthesis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, the fimbrial protein, the transport and chelation of metal ion, and others (sctT, rhs, and pspG). The strain DeltaSEN1393 was deduced to damage Fe<ce: glyph name='sbnd"></ce: glyph name='sbnd">S cluster enzymes and increase the sulfate and iron requirements, and to reduce bacterial motility and copper homeostasis. Via InterProScan analysis, the gene SEN1393 was speculated to encode a TerB-like and/or DjlA-like protein, and therefore, together with cysJ, possibly reduced the oxidative toxicities resulting from oxyanions such as tellurite, and/or improved CysPUWA conformation to restrain the uptake of the toxic oxyanions. In summary, the gene SEN1393 enabled the higher survival of S. Enteritidis in egg white as compared to other pathogens by regulating the sulfate assimilation pathway.

J		Bin Liu; Bingxue Liu; Ran Wang; Yuan Li							alpha-Lactalbumin self-assembled nanoparticles with various morphologies, stiffnesses, and sizes as Pickering stabilizers for oil-in-water emulsions and delivery of curcumin.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					To systematically study the multiple effects of nanoparticles (NPs) on the stability, interfacial activity, and digestive properties of Pickering emulsions (PEs), various oil-in-water PEs were prepared by NPs based on the self-assembled alpha-lactalbumin-derived peptides with a variety of morphologies, stiffnesses, and sizes. We discovered that PEs stabilized by small-sized and soft nanospheres (NSs) exhibited the highest stability compared with other nanoparticles observed by Turbiscan during storage. Dilational interfacial rheological analysis demonstrated that a highly elastic interfacial film of the NSs had been formed by orderly packing at oil/water interfaces. Meanwhile, the most stable Pickering emulsion stabilized by NSs possessed the lowest lipid digestion rate. The tubular NPs distributed unevenly at the oil-water interfaces therefore showed lower interfacial activity. Harder NPs with lower flexibility showed a lower emulsion stability. Curcumin was loaded in PEs to further study the effect of bioavailability. Moreover, in vivo pharmacokinetic results revealed that Pickering emulsion stabilized by NSs showed the highest curcumin bioavailability, which was 5.37 times higher than unencapsulated curcumin. This study suggested that Pickering emulsion stabilized by NSs with the optimum stability was the most promising delivery system for hydrophobic bioactive ingredients.										2021	69	8	2485	2492	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06263					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10812

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effect of the number of carboxy group on the formation of complexes between starch and fatty acids using different dicarboxylic acids and monobasic acids as ligand. The complexing index (CI) indicated that dicarboxylic acids could form complexes with starch and show stronger complexing ability than corresponding monobasic acids. Results from differential scanning calorimetry also displayed that starch-dicarboxylic acids complexes presented higher onset temperature, narrow transition peaks and higher enthalpy change, indicating the higher thermal stability and uniform and homogenous crystal of starch-dicarboxylic acids complexes. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy showed that the long-range and short-range order of starch-dicarboxylic acids complexes was better than that of starch-monobasic acids. According to above results, fatty acid with two carboxyl groups could form larger amount and more stability complexes than it is with one carboxyl group. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	12	6667	6673	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15343					FSTA:2022-03-Ac4307

Journal of Food Biochemistry					In the present study, a kind of structured lipids, namely 1,3-di-oleic-2-medium chain (OMO) triacylglycerols, were synthesized through lipase-catalyzed reactions using coconut oil and rapeseed acid as materials in a trace water-in-oil system. Experimental analysis and computational simulations were undertaken to compare the stability of four lipases including Lipozyme RMIM, Lipozyme TLIM, Novozym 435, and Aspergillus oryzae immobilized lipase (AOIM), and illustrate catalytic mechanism of Novozym 435 during the synthesis of OMO. Fourier transform infrared and molecular dynamics simulation results demonstrated that a decrease in ordered structure (alpha-helix and beta-sheet) led to a reduction in enzyme activity. Compared with Lipozyme RMIM and Novozym 435, Lipozyme TLIM and AOIM exhibited better stability due to a short-chain lid in TLIM, which covers activity sites, and hydrogen bonds formed between activity center of AOIM and water. Among four lipases, AOIM exhibited best catalytic performance: a OMO yield of 30.7% at 3 hr and a good stability of long term (48 hr). Density functional theory results demonstrated that specifically, during the synthesis of OMO triacylglycerol, the addition of Novozym 435 (derived from Candida antarctica lipase B, CALB) substantially lowered reaction barriers (64.4 KJ/mol with CALB vs. 332.7 KJ/mol with no lipase), aiding in the generation of OMO because of the formations of transitional tetrahedral intermediates. A trace water-in-oil system was a green and efficient alternative for lipase-catalyzed production of OMO, and this study provided crucial insights into the stability/instability and catalytic mechanisms of lipase in the synthesis of structured lipids. Practical applications. We compared the stability of Lipozyme RMIM, Lipozyme 435, Lipozyme TLIM, and AOIM during the synthesis of the OMO triacylglycerols in a trace water-in-oil system, where exhibited a high catalytic activity of lipase in water-oil interface. AOIM had the highest stability and showed the best catalytic performance due to the formation of hydrogen bonds. Besides, for the first time, the transition tetrahedral structure was revealed in the enzymatic synthesis of medium-and long-chain triacylglycerols. This study provides a rational approach to compare lipase stability and a possible hint to choose appropriate enzyme in a specific catalytic condition. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13667					FSTA:2021-09-Ae12896

Journal of Functional Foods					This research investigated the effects of different triglycerides on lipid deposition and the underlying mechanism in oleic acid-induced human hepatic LO2 cells. Cells were treated with vehicle, oleic acid (OA), OA+coconut oil (CO), OA+rapeseed oil (RO), OA+physical mixture oil of CO and RO (CROM), OA+interesterified oil of CO and RO (CROI, rich in medium-and long-chain triglycerides (MLCTs)), OA+1,3-di-oleic-2-medium chain triglycerides (OMO, a kind of MLCTs) and OA+1,3-di-oleic-2-palmitic triglyceride (OPO) for 24h. Compared with the OA group, OA+CROI and OA+OMO treatment significantly reduced (P<0.05) the contents of total triglyceride and total cholesterol. Moreover, CROI and OMO down-regulated the protein expression of diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT1), and up-regulated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferators activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). This study showed that CROI and OMO triglycerides, abundant in MLCTs, attenuated lipid accumulation and regulated the expression of lipid metabolism-related proteins in LO2 cells induced by oleic acid.

International Journal of Food Properties					Late-stage nitrogen (N) fertilization is an important crop management for improving rice production and also affects the quality of rice, whereas information on the influence of late N on structural and functional properties of indica rice starch is lacking. In this study, effects of various N rates (0, 60, and 120 kg ha-1 referred to as N, N60 and N120, respectively) on structural and functional properties of grain starches from two rice cultivars (OM052 and Chaoyou1000) were investigated. Comparison of different N treatments showed that late N application exhibited strong influence on starch properties, and the sensitivity to N application varied with rice genotypes. Compared to non N rate, higher input of N (N60 for OM052, and N120 for Chaoyou1000) significantly reduced apparent amylose content (AAC), relative crystallinity (RC), gelatinization enthalpy, swelling power, solubility and degree of hydrolysis, but significantly increased the proportion of short chains with degree of polymerization 6-12 in amylopectin and gelatinization onset temperature. Further comparison and principal component analyses revealed that the variations in the starch functional properties were due mainly to the changes in RC. The solubility was positively associated with AAC. The present results can provide important information for understanding the environmental regulation of starch biosynthesis in rice grain.

Food Chemistry					Lignin is an important component of the healing tissue in fruits. In this study, we treated muskmelon (Cucumis melo L. Cv. "Manao") fruit with exogenous nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) to observe and analyze its effect on lignin synthesis and accumulation during healing. Results showed that SNP treatment enhanced the contents of endogenous NO and H2O2, increased the activities of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate 4 hydroxylase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, and peroxidase, and raised the contents of sinapyl alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, coumaryl alcohol, and lignin. SNP augmented the hardness of the healing tissue and decreased its resilience, springiness, and cohesiveness. In addition, SNP treatment effectively reduced the weight loss and disease index of wounded muskmelons. All these results suggest that lignin metabolism mediated by NO play a crucial role in wound healing of muskmelons.

Antibacterial activity, optical, and functional properties of corn starch-based films impregnated with bamboo leaf volatile oil.		Food Chemistry					In this study, the optical, morphological, antibacterial, and physical properties of corn starch-based films prepared by a solution casting method were investigated after adding various levels of bamboo leaf volatile oil (BVO, 0.5,1, and 2%). Further, the roughness was measured by atomic force microscopy and the antibacterial activities were tested by agar diffusion method. We found that the thickness (TC) and elongation at break (EAB) of the corn starch-based films increased significantly (Duncan's range test , P< 0.05) with the addition of BVO (TC from 0.121 to 0.207 mm; EAB from 2.48 to 10.40%). However, with the addition of BVO, the moisture content (MC) and water-solubility decreased (MC: from 13.12 to 11.41%; water solubility: from 30.58 to 26.95%), and the water vapor permeability (WVP) and tensile strength (TS) decreased significantly (WVP: from 3.91 to 3.05 g m m-2 s-1 Pa-1; TS: from 20.64 to 10.68 MPa, Duncan's range test, P< 0.05). Furthermore, supplementation of BVO to corn starch-based films increased the surface roughness and the antibacterial effects. The addition of BVO also increases the opacity of the films, which is helpful to protect food from ultraviolet damage. In sum, this study provides a theoretical basis for using corn starch-based films as alternative packing biomaterial.

Structural changes in corn starch granules treated at different temperatures.		Food Hydrocolloids					The four structural levels of corn starch granules are as follows: particle structure, growth ring, crystalline region and chain structure. In this study, corn starch granules treated at different temperatures (50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C), then freeze-dried were evaluated. The corn starch granules remained largely intact in the control and at 50 °C and 60 °C, but with increasing temperature, the starch granules were broken. The growth ring structure and crystallization zone gradually broke up and disappeared with increasing temperature. Moreover, with increasing temperature, the degree of order (DO) and degree of the double helix (DD) of the crystalline region decreased gradually, indicating that the double helix structure of amylopectin in corn starch dissociated during heating. The molecular weight distribution index of corn starch was analyzed by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) and found that it increased with increasing temperature, indicating that the molecular chains of corn starch were broken during heating. In sum, the structural levels of corn starch granules, including the particle structure, growth ring, and crystalline region were damaged to varying degrees, whereas chain structure has been changed, after being processed at different temperatures. This study provides a model for theory of gelatinization in corn starch system. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	118				0268-005X				10.1016/j.foodhyd.2021.106760					FSTA:2021-08-Le1363

Foods					Furan is a volatile and carcinogenic heterocyclic chemical compound that occurs in a wide range of thermally processed food. It can be induced during food-preparing processes by high temperatures and UV-C light. In the present study, the degradation of furan content in ground coffee, Maillard model system, and not-from-concentrate (NFC) apple juice by red-fleshed apple anthocyanin extract (RAAE) was studied. The results demonstrated that RAAEs had different degrees of degradation of furan content in coffee powder, and the RAAE from "XJ3" had the most significant effect, with a reduction rate of up to 20%. Moreover, by adding RAAE to the Maillard model system, we found the amounts of furan were significantly reduced. At the same time, RAAE from "XJ3" could observably reduce the content of furan in pasteurized NFC juice, with "Fuli" NFC juice furan content decreasing the most, which was 68%. Taken together, our study demonstrated that the use of RAAE could be a feasible way to reduce furan content in ground coffee, Maillard model system, and NFC apple juice. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bin Wang; Junlin He; Shujuan Zhang; Lili Li							Nondestructive prediction and visualization of total flavonoids content in Cerasus Humilis fruit during storage periods based on hyperspectral imaging technique.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					In this study, the changes of total flavonoids content in Cerasus Humilis fruits during storage periods were detected by using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technique over the spectral region of 895-1,700nm, and the spatial distribution of flavonoids was visualized during 24days storage periods. The hyperspectral images of 240 samples of Cerasus Humilis were collected at different storage times (0, 8, 16, and 24days). The Monte-Carlo outlier detection method was applied to identify four abnormal samples, three spectral preprocessing methods were used to preprocess the original spectral data, including savitzky-golay, standard normal variate, and baseline correction (BC). The x-loading weights, competitive adaptive reweighed sampling (CARS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), UVE-CARS and the combination of UVE and successive projections algorithm (UVE-SPA) were used to reduce the dimension of spectral data and extract the characteristic wavelength, respectively. Then multiple linear regression and nonlinear least squared support vector machine (LS-SVM) regression models were developed based on full-spectrum data and selected characteristic wavelength. The results showed that BC was the best preprocessing approach, the LS-SVM models based on the nine effective wavelengths selected by UVE-CARS achieved the best results with correlation coefficient of prediction of. 9357, root mean square error of prediction of 2.0107, and residual prediction deviation of 2.2809, respectively. The overall results demonstrated that the HSI technology coupled with chemometric algorithms is feasible to determine total flavonoids content, UVE-CARS-LS-SVM model was the optimal model. Visualization of the total flavonoids content during storage periods distribution map was performed, which clearly showed that the total flavonoids content kept decreasing with storage time. Practical Applications. Cerasus Humilis is a fruit tree resource endemic to China. The content of total flavonoids is one of the key factors that affect the edible quality of Cerasus Humilis fruit. With the increase of storage time, the active components of flavonoids are easy to be degraded by oxidation, the quality and commercial value of Cerasus Humilis fruit were negatively affected. Thus, the detection of total flavonoids content during the storage of Cerasus Humilis fruit is of great significance. Traditional methods for determining total flavonoids content (such as the spectrophotometric techniques method) are mostly destructive, inefficient, time-consuming, and environmental pollution, which cannot meet the requirements of online monitoring of total flavonoids content. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology has the advantages of rapid, nondestructive, accurate, and nonpollution. The results indicated that the HSI technology coupled with chemometric algorithms could be used to predict the changes of the total flavonoids content in Cerasus Humilis fruit during storage periods, which provided a theoretical basis for online and real-time monitoring of the quality of Cerasus Humilis fruit during storage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	10			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13807					FSTA:2022-02-Jd1723
J		Bin Wang; Xingfen He; Yang Bi; Hong Jiang; Yi Wang; Xiaoyuan Zheng; Dov Prusky							Preharvest sprays with sodium nitroprusside induce resistance in harvested muskmelon against the pink rot disease.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Pink rot caused by Trichothecium roseum is an important postharvest disease of muskmelon, and caused very serious postharvest losses. In this study, sodium nitroprusside (SNP), an exogenous nitric oxide donor, was applied four times during fruit development to muskmelon. The effect of SNP sprays on pink rot in harvested fruit and the influence on the mechanism of antioxidant enzymes and the phenylpropanoid pathway were investigated. The results showed that SNP sprays significantly reduced decay incidence and lesion area of muskmelon inoculated with T. roseum. SNP sprays induced the production of H2O2 in fruit at harvest, maintained cell membrane integrity, and increased the activity of superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, and ascorbate peroxidase during storage. In addition, SNP sprays also increased the activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase, and promoted the accumulation of total phenolic, flavonoid, and lignin content in harvested muskmelon at harvest and during storage. These results suggesting a new possible way of prevention of postharvest pathogens. Practical applications. Muskmelon is an important cash crop in the world, due to its unique appearance and intrinsic quality. However, postharvest losses of the muskmelon fruit are serious. Pink rot caused by Trichothecium roseum is one of the main reasons for the postharvest losses of harvested muskmelon. SNP preharvest sprays effectively induced the resistance and reduced decay incidence and lesion area of muskmelon inoculated with T. roseum. Compared with the postharvest treatment, which involves complete exposure, preharvest sprays not only affects the fruit, but also other portions of the plants, which could indirectly affect fruit quality. In addition, the preharvest treatment operation is simple and convenient, and the control effect is better than the postharvest treatment. Therefore, this work may provide a new approach for the control of postharvest diseases of muskmelon. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15339					FSTA:2021-08-Jg10427
J		Bin Wang; Shangde Sun; Ning Yao; Chenxin Chu							A novel method for simultaneous degumming and deacidification of corn oil by miscella refining in one step.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In order to overcome the issues (losses of neutral oil and trace nutrients, waste discharge and great energy consumption) in the traditional degumming and deacidification processes of corn oil, a new refining process using alkali aqueous solution was developed. The miscella of corn oil was used to investigate the effect of the refining process on acid value and phosphorus content of corn oil. Results showed that phospholipids and free fatty acids can be simultaneously successfully removed using this one step method. Under the optimized conditions (50 g/100g miscella oil concentration, 30 g/100g excess alkali, 10 °Be alkali concentration and 150 rpm at 50 °C for 60 min), the phosphorus content and acid value of corn oil can be decreased from 587.5710.32 mg/kg and 5.130.51 mgKOH/g to 5.791.49 mg/kg and 0.10 mgKOH/g, respectively. High oil yield (95.3 g/100g) was achieved at low temperature (50 °C). The washing process was saved and no waste water was formed in this method.

Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effect of germination time on compositional changes and functionality of whole wheat malt flour (WMF) as well as its influence on cookie quality. The results illustrated that malting resulted in decreases of starch, protein, fat and ash, while it increased dietary fiber, carbohydrate and energy. Gel hydration, emulsifying and foaming ability, pasting viscosity decreased significantly, particularly during the first 2 days of germination. Both bound and immobilized water in WMF decreased with increasing germination time while the concentration and antioxidant capacity of extractable and hydrolyzable phenolic compounds (EPP and HPP) increased significantly in WMF and malt-based cookies. Flours changed from an integrated granular to an irregular tousy structure during germination. The incorporation of WMF induced a distorted "honey-like" comb structure to the cookies. Conclusively, controlled germination not only improves the physicochemical, functional properties of WMF but also increases nutrition value and technological performance of malt-based cookies.

Food Control					Edible coatings based on agar/sodium alginate (AS) and AS containing ginger essential oil (AS+ GEO) were prepared and their effects on the quality and shelf-life of fresh beef during refrigerated storage studied. Uncoated (control) and coated beef samples were analyzed periodically during storage at 4 °C for microbial colony growth (total viable counts, psychrotrophs, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, yeasts and molds), physico-chemical (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, peroxide value), pH value, sensory evaluation, odor (electronic nose) and texture characteristics (springiness, chewiness and hardness). Coating treatments significantly (p< 0.05) retarded the oxidation of beef slices, with TBARS values of 3.132, 1.868, 0.986 mg MDA/kg and PV values of 8.86, 7.46, 4.26 meq/kg for uncoated, AS coated and AS + GEO coated samples on day 18 of storage respectively. A similar reduction trend was observed for microbial population. TVC, PTC, E. coli, S. aureus, yeasts and molds were 7.50, 6.86, 6.20, 4.70 and 3.90 log CFU/g at the end of storage for AS + GEO coated samples lower than those of uncoated and AS coated samples. The comprehensive results from the lipid oxidation and microbial assays (especially the TVC) showed that the shelf-life for uncoated, AS coated and AS+ GEO coated samples was ~7 d, ~10 d, ~16 d, indicating the AS and AS+ GEO coatings could extend the shelf life of fresh beef by 3-6 and 9 days respectively, compared with the control samples. Furthermore, the odor and texture evaluations demonstrated that the beef coated with AS+ GEO had improved sensory attributes during the storage period. The results from this study may provide a basis for the development of AS+ GEO as an antibacterial coating material for chilled beef storage.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This work intends to develop an online experimental system for screening of deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination in whole wheat meals by visible/near-infrared (Vis/NIR) spectroscopy and computer vision coupling technology. Spectral and image information of samples with various DON levels was collected at speed of 0.15 m s-1 on a conveyor belt. The two-type data were then integrated and subjected to chemometric analysis. Discriminant analysis showed that samples could be classified by setting 1000 mug kg-1 as the cut-off value. The best correct classified rate obtained in prediction was 93.55% based on fusion of spectral and image features, with reduced prediction uncertainty as compared to single feature. However, quantification of DON by quantitative analysis was not successful due to poor model performance. These results indicate that, although not accurate enough to provide conclusive result, this coupling technology could be adopted for rapid screening of DON contamination in cereals and feeds during processing. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	6	2588	2595	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14775					FSTA:2021-10-Mj5965

Inhibition of lipid damage in refrigerated salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) by a combined treatment of CO2 packaging and high-pressure processing.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effect of a previous combined treatment (CO2-enriched modified atmosphere packaging, MAP and high-pressure processing, HPP, 150MPa/5min) on lipid stability of refrigerated (10days/4 °C) salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) was studied. The following processing conditions were compared: B-0 (fish without MAP or HPP), B-1 (fish packaged under MAP and without HPP), B-2 (fish subjected to HPP without MAP) and B-3 (fish subjected to MAP and HPP). An inhibitory effect (P<0.05) on lipid hydrolysis and oxidation was obtained by the presence of CO2 in the packaging medium; values detected at day 10 for B-0 and B-1 fish were 80.72 and 49.61 (g free fatty acids, FFA, kg-1 lipids), 6.14 and 2.81 (meq active oxygenkg-1 lipids; peroxide value), 5.05 and 3.10 (mg malondialdehydekg-1 muscle), and 5.56 and 2.70 (fluorescence ratio), respectively. Furthermore, inhibition of lipid damage was observed for HPP alone; values detected at day 10 for B-2 fish were 76.24 (g FFAkg-1 lipids) and 5.28 (meq active oxygenkg-1 lipids). The lowest average values for lipid hydrolysis and oxidation were obtained in samples corresponding to the combined treatment (B-3 batch), differences being significant (P<0.05) at day 10 for FFA (41.43gkg-1 lipids), peroxide (1.84meqkg-1 lipids) and fluorescence (2.50) values. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	11	5968	5976	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15179					FSTA:2022-03-Rc0689
J		Bin Zhang; Zhichang Qiu; Ruixuan Zhao; Zhenjia Zheng; Xiaoming Lu; Xuguang Qiao							Effect of blanching and freezing on the physical properties, bioactive compounds, and microstructure of garlic (Allium sativum L.).		Journal of Food Science					The aim of this work was to evaluate the impact of blanching on the physical properties of frozen garlic cloves and to explore the relationship between quality changes and microstructure. A short-term blanching treatment (100 °C for 45 s, 90 °C for 45 s, and 80 °C for 60 s) before freezing did not affect the total organosulfur compound content. In a preliminary research, blanching conditions were determined to be 100 °C for 45 to 80 s. Under these conditions, peroxidase was inactivated, but organosulfur compounds were retained. Mechanical and color tests showed a damaging effect of blanching and freezing on frozen garlic blanched for 60 and 80 s at 100 °C. Compared to frozen fresh garlic, frozen garlic treated by blanching for 45 s at 100 °C retained 2871.49200.24 g/g of allicin, although 81.83% of peroxidase was inactivated; browning and hardness improved by 49.97 and 48.01%, respectively. According to scanning electron microscopy, significant damage to the microstructure was observed in both frozen fresh garlic and frozen garlic after 60 s and 80 s of blanching at 100 °C. Moreover, 1H low-field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) indicated that blanching for 60 s and 80 s induced an increase in free water in garlic tissues, resulting in further damage after freezing. As peroxidase was efficiently inactivated, the microstructure and organosulfur compounds were better preserved, and blanching treatment at 100 °C for 45 s before freezing is a potential method for obtaining frozen garlic with high sensory and nutritional qualities. Practical Application. Freezing helps to overcome challenges associated with growing seasons and the deterioration of garlic during storage. After frozen garlic is thawed, it is prone to some undesirable changes, such as enzymatic browning and softening. Minimal blanching (45 s at 100 °C) pretreatment can help to maintain the bioactive compounds of garlic and prevent texture and color deterioration caused by freezing directly. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	1	31	39	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15525					FSTA:2021-05-Te1831

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The antibacterial seaweed polysaccharide-based bilayer films were developed, which consisted of sodium alginate and agar, and incorporated with six different essential oils (EOs). The effect of different EOs on the bilayer film properties was extensively investigated based on the antimicrobial activity, the physical, mechanical and microstructure properties of the films. Addition of EOs significantly enhanced the thickness and elongation at break of the films, while decreased the tensile strength. The bilayer film containing ginger EO exhibited obvious and longer-lasting antimicrobial activity compared to films contained other EOs. It was also proved that the ginger EO film exhibit the most uniform porous structure and high crystallinity by the SEM and X-ray diffraction. Although the incorporation of EOs reduced the thermal stability of films, the better maintenance effect of ginger EO to the thermal stability of the ginger EO film was observed. According to ginger EO contained plentiful monocyclic sesquiterpenoids (71.01%) with conjugation structures, ginger EO molecules would combine with sodium alginate-agar through the p-pi conjugation. Thus, the functional properties revealed that ginger EO was more positive to the comprehensive performance of films, and the sodium alginate-agar bilayer film contained ginger EO exhibited a strong potential of use in food packaging.

Food Science & Nutrition					10-Gingerol (10-Gin), an active ingredient extracted from ginger, has been reported to have beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. However, 10-Gin has not been proved to offer protection against cardiomyocyte injury induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of 10-Gin against H/R-induced injury and its potential mechanisms in cardiomyocytes. A H/R injury model of H9c2 cardiomyocytes was established using 600 mumol/L CoCl2 to induce hypoxia in the cells for 24 hr and then reoxygenated for 3 hr. 10-Gin was pretreated with H9c2 cardiomyocytes for 24 hr to assess its cardiomyocyte protection. Our results showed that 10-Gin improved the viability of H9c2 cardiomyocytes in the H/R model and decreased the activities of creatine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, and the generation of reactive oxygen species. By intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) fluorescence, we found that 10-Gin could significantly reduce the [Ca2+]i concentration. 10-Gin administration increased the activities of antioxidase and reduced malondialdehyde content and inflammatory cytokine levels. 10-Gin also reduced the apoptosis levels. Importantly, 10-Gin administration decreased the gene and protein expressions of Wnt5a and Frizzled-2. In conclusion, 10-Gin alleviates H/R-induced cardiomyocyte injury, which is associated with the antioxidation, anti-inflammation, antiapoptosis action, and reduction of [Ca2+]i overload by suppressing the Wnt5a/Frizzled-2 pathway. © 2021 The Authors.

Assessment of a novel in-flight washing device: microbial reduction and food quality of chopped iceberg lettuce during storage.		Food Control					Washing is an essential postharvest processing step for reducing microbial populations, tissue latex fluids, and soil on fresh and fresh-cut produce. This study focuses on the performance of a novel in-flight washer (IFW) in which produce falls through a round vertical canister, equipped with an array of nozzles near its interior boundary, spraying a sanitizing liquid upward and radially inward so as to directly impact the falling produce. The spray retards downward motion of the produce, while reorienting it as it falls, thus improving contact between liquid and produce. Chopped iceberg lettuce was passed through an IFW, a flume system, or sequentially through both, with different free chlorine levels. Microbial reduction and quality parameters (sensory attributes and tissue membrane integrity) were evaluated on days 0, 7, and 14 of a 14-day storage period. When washed only in the IFW with 200 mg/L free chlorine (FC), 1.0 and 1.4 log reductions of inoculated E. coli were achieved on Days 0 and 14, respectively. These reductions are comparable to or greater than those achieved with only flume washing at 20 mg/L FC. Among all treatments, washing in IFW at 200 mg/L FC resulted in the lowest aerobic plate count and yeast and mold values, as well as the highest overall quality score. These results indicate that use of the IFW can improve postharvest food safety and quality of fresh-cut lettuce, compared to conventional flume washing.

S. van der							Arabinan side-chains strongly affect the emulsifying properties of acid-extracted sugar beet pectins.		Food Hydrocolloids					Pectins extracted from sugar beet pulp are promising additives for the food and beverage industry due to their good emulsifying properties. However, the relationship between molecular structure and emulsifying properties is still not fully understood; thus, systematic optimization of pectin extraction for a better emulsifying activity is not possible. In this study, we assess the underlying relationship between molecular structure and emulsifying properties by linking relevant structural parameters of 43 acid-extracted sugar beet pectins to their emulsifying properties. Sugar beet pectins with distinct structural characteristics were produced by acid extraction using varying conditions. The extracted polysaccharides were used as emulsifying agents in oil-in-water emulsions. Resulting droplet sizes were measured to correlate molecular characteristics with emulsifying properties. Analyses of protein content, degree of methylation, degree of acetylation, mean molecular weights, and trans-ferulic acid contents showed that these parameters affect the emulsifying properties to some degree, but cannot fully explain the differences observed among all pectins. However, a linear correlation between the proportion of neutral sugar side chains and droplet sizes was observed. The influence of galactose (18-30 mol%) was negligible, but increasing amounts of branched arabinans (up to 57 mol% arabinose) positively affected the emulsification result. Based on these results, it can be concluded that particularly branched arabinan side chains play an important role in the sugar beet pectin-based stabilization of emulsions. Thus, the arabinose content appears to be a suitable indicator to estimate the emulsifying properties of acid-extracted sugar beet pectins. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Impact of global climate change on the European barley market requires novel multi-method approaches to preserve crop quality and authenticity.		Foods					Most recently in 2018 and 2019, large parts of Europe were affected by periods of massive drought. Resulting losses in cereal yield pose a major risk to the global supply of barley, as more than 60% of global production is based in Europe. Despite the arising price fluctuations on the cereal market, authenticity of the crop must be ensured, which includes correct declaration of harvest years. Here, we show a novel approach that allows such differentiation for spring barley samples, which takes advantage of the chemical changes caused by the extreme drought. Samples from 2018 were successfully differentiated from those of 2017 by analysis of changes in near-infrared spectra, enrichment in the isotope 13C, and strong accumulation of the plant-physiological marker betaine. We demonstrate that through consideration of multiple modern analysis techniques, not only can fraudulent labelling be prevented, but indispensable knowledge on the drought tolerance of crops can be obtained. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study investigated the effect of sonication alone and sonication with subsequent pasteurization on physicochemical and antioxidant properties of juice extracted from the ripe or overripe wax apple. Samples were sonicated for varying times (0-10 min) at a fixed frequency (28 kHz) and temperature (20 °C) and then, pasteurized at 90 °C for 2 min. Irrespective of the maturity, sonication improved the color characteristics (lightness, chroma, and hue) of wax apple juices (p> 0.05). Other quality parameters (titratable acidity, total soluble solids, cloud value and electrical conductivity) exhibited similar changes for all the juice samples tested. Sonicated samples retained higher antioxidant activity (5%-30%), especially in the ripe juice, whereas pasteurization significantly reduced (5%-20%) the antioxidant activity, as well as the total phenolic content. Moreover, sonication significantly reduced the enzyme activities, including polyphenol oxidase, polygalacturonase, pectin methylesterase, and peroxidase by 2%-10% when compared with pasteurization. Overall, sonication, either individually or in conjunction with pasteurization or thermal processing, was beneficial for maintaining the quality by inactivating enzymes, and retaining nutrients, whereas pasteurization degraded these juices. Novelty impact statement. Ripe and overripe wax apple fruit juice was treated by pasteurization and sonication. Sonicated ripe wax apple juice was found to improve various phytochemical contents and antioxidant activities.

The protein-protein interactions, surface hydrophobicity, and rheological properties of milk protein concentrate extruded using dies of different geometries (circular, annular and slit) were quantified. With the same extrusion treatment history prior to the die, extrudates generated using dies with higher wall shear (slit 1.4*104 s-1> annular 1.1*104 s-1> circular 2.9*103 s-1) showed greater protein extractability, higher index of surface hydrophobicity, and enhanced water solubility index indicating significant breakdown of protein aggregates. Higher viscoelastic moduli (G′ and G) and apparent viscosity were observed for slit die extrudate dispersions. However, low flow behavior indices (0.04-0.23 (-)) and a high viscous activation energy (43 kJ/mol) of slit die extrudate dispersions implied their shear and temperature sensitivity, respectively. Thus, extrudate functionality can be optimized by selection of the appropriate die design.

J		Bindvi Arora; Schulz, P.; Rizvi, S. S. H.							In-process flow behavior and structure formation during supercritical fluid extrusion of milk protein concentrate.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The in-line flow behavior of milk protein concentrate (MPC) and MPC-sucrose (MPC-S) blends with and without added supercritical CO2 (SC-CO2) during extrusion was quantified using a slit die rheometer and related to the expansion characteristics of extrudates. The apparent viscosity of the melt was in order: MPC > MPC+ SC-CO2> MPC-S > MPC-S+ SC-CO2. A lower viscosity reduction factor due to SC-CO2 incorporation was observed for MPC-S (1.3-1.1) compared to MPC (1.5-1.2) owing to decreased volume fraction of protein in MPC-S. Increase in the apparent viscosity increased the expansion ratio for both MPC and MPC-S extrudates from 2.2 to 4.3 and 1.9 to 4 and decreased the average cell size from 924 to 392 and 936 to 354 m, respectively. Thus, expansion and cellular architecture of MPC-based extrudates can be improved by controlling the melt viscosity. The findings of this study could have significant utility in designing novel milk protein-based products. Practical applications. Milk protein concentrates are highly valuable and nutritionally attractive products and their conversion into expanded and texturally designed foods will be a valuable addition to the market. The cellular architecture of such foods is one of the primary indicators of the consumer-acceptable quality and depends upon the melt rheology, which in turn is related to the feed composition and processing conditions within the extruder. Relating the in-line rheological properties to extrudate characteristics can provide better decision-making ability for the selection of feed ingredients, diluents, and inert ingredients for the development of expanded milk protein puffs of commercial utility. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15348					FSTA:2021-08-Pn4196
J		Bing Gao; Xiaodong Xu; Lujia Han; Xian Liu							A novel near infrared spectroscopy analytical strategy for meat and bone meal species discrimination based on the insight of fraction composition complexity.		Food Chemistry					This study analyzed the meat and bone meal (MBM) matrix complexity from the perspective of fraction composition diversity and a classification strategy was proposed to accurately and rapidly identify the MBM species based on near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Partial Least Squares-Discrimination Analysis (PLS-DA) based on full samples, meat meal (MM), MBM and bone meal (BM) performed with decreasing classification errors of 0.115, 0.079, 0.044 and 0.039 which were partly caused by wide sample range; bone fraction content had positive correlation with most of MBM species differences reflected by principal component scores; and PLS-DA classification errors among MM, MBM and BM were lower than 0.013. To take fully advantage of the above results, a sequential classification strategy was proposed; near infrared spectra were selected (belong to MM, MBM or BM) and then species discrimination analysis was conducted based on the specific PLS-DA model.

J		Bing Gao; Shuai Xu; Lujia Han; Xian Liu							FT-IR-based quantitative analysis strategy for target adulterant in fish oil multiply adulterated with terrestrial animal lipid.		Food Chemistry					The interference of nontarget adulterant on FT-IR-based target adulterant quantitative analysis was explored and a sequential strategy was proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of the quantitative analysis model. Based on the FT-IR data of fish oil adulterated with terrestrial animal lipid, PLS and PLS-DA results show that quantitative analysis modeled by multiple and single adulteration data do not apply to each other; quantitative models based on the fusion of single and multiple adulteration data were established and showed a low quantitative analysis precision (higher RSD); and the sensitivity and specificity of discrimination analysis for multiply and singly adulterated fish oils both all exceed 0.910. To enhance the detection accuracy, a sequential strategy was proposed; identifying singly or multiply adulterated fish oil and then quantifying the content of adulterant was considered an efficient approach.

Harraz; Ya Cao							Cascade strand displacement reaction-assisted aptamer-based highly sensitive detection of ochratoxin A.		Food Chemistry					Ochratoxin A (OTA) is a toxic metabolite that is widely distributed in food products. Herein, we proposed a new fluorescent aptasensor for OTA detection by using cascade strand displacement reaction. The binding of OTA and OTA aptamer on magnetic beads surface inhibited its hybridization with complementary DNA, and subsequently initiated the strand displacement reaction that induced amplified fluorescence signal. By tracing fluorescence response, our method demonstrated an improved detection limit of 0.63 ng/mL, a short assay time of 110 min, and a satisfactory detection specificity by using ochratoxin B, aflatoxin B1, and zearalenone as control toxins. Recovery studies were conducted by spiking OTA in real food samples, including white wine, red wine, cereal drink, coffee beverage and tea beverage, and confirmed desirable accuracy and practical applicability of our method. Therefore, our method may have a great potential use in the food quality control in the future.

J		Bing Han; Pu Jiang; Lingmin Jiang; Xuegang Li; Xiaoli Ye							Three phytosterols from sweet potato inhibit MCF7-xenograft-tumor growth through modulating gut microbiota homeostasis and SCFAs secretion.		Food Research International					Researches demonstrated that gut microbiota are associated with breast cancer progression. This study aims to evaluate the anti-breast tumor effects of daucosterol linolenate (DLA), daucosterol linoleate (DL), and daucosterol palmitate (DP) from sweet potato in MCF-7 xenograft nude mice by determining the tumor growth, serum tumor markers, tumor-related proteins, and performing 16S rDNA sequencing. After treatment at 87.8 mg/kg/day for 29 days, DLA, DL and DP delayed tumor growth and decreased levels of tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and cancer antigen 153 (CA153) in vivo. All treatments activated caspase 3, 9, PARP1 cleavage, down-regulated Ki67, VEGF, BCL-2, BCL-XL, up-regulated BAX expression, and inhibited PI3K/AKT/NF-kappaB activation in tumor tissues. Their anti-breast tumor effects were associated with the regulation on gut microbiota. The three treatments increased Bacteroidetes whereas decreased Firmicutes richness. They also modulated the diversity of gut microbiota at family and genus levels. Furthermore, DL treatment promoted butyric acid secretion, DP promoted acetic acid and butyric acid secretion in the colorectal and feces. Our findings indicate that DLA, DL, and DP inhibit tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft nude mice by regulating the homeostasis of gut microbiota, producing SCFAs, and then disturbing the expression of cancer-related proteins. The present study suggests three phytosterols as gut microbiota regulator for breast cancer prevention.

J		Bing Hu; Jing Hu; Lingyu Han; Jijuan Cao; Katsuyoshi Nishinari; Jixin Yang; Yapeng Fang; Dongmei Li							Conformational transition and gelation of kappa-carrageenan in electrostatic complexation with beta-lactoglobulin aggregates.		Food Hydrocolloids					The goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of electrostatic complexation with three different beta-lactoglobulin aggregates on the conformational transition and gelation of kappa-carrageenan (kappa-car). We prepared native granular beta-lactoglobulin (NGBLG), nanoparticle beta-lactoglobulin (NPBLG), and fibrillary beta-lactoglobulin (FBLG), and then assessed their electrostatic complexation with kappa-car and the resultant impact on kappa-car conformational transition, gelation, and microstructural changes. A quantitative model based on the McGhee-Hippel theory was adopted as a means of describing the impact of electrostatic complexation on the kappa-car conformational transition in the presence of these protein aggregates. FBLG resulted in the most significant inhibition of kappa-car conformational transition and gelation, whereas NPBLG had the least significant impact on this process. This was attributed to the fact that NPBLG imposed the least steric hindrance of these three aggregates. Together, these data highlight promising approaches to regulating polysaccharide gelation, viscoelasticity, rheological behavior, and conformational transition for use in a range of industrial applications.

J		Bing Liu; Youling. L Xiong; Jiang Jiang; Dongyou Yu; Gang Lin							Cellular antioxidant mechanism of selenium-enriched yeast diets in the protection of meat quality of heat-stressed hens.		Food Bioscience					The effects and mechanisms of dietary selenium-enriched yeast (SeY, at Se 0, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/kg) on breast meat quality and oxidative stability of heat-stressed laying hens were studied. Two hundred and forty healthy Jingbai cross-bred hens at late laying period were randomly assigned to 4 experimental groups: one control group reared in a controlled thermal environment, and three treatment groups reared with heat stress (HS). The birds assigned to the controlled thermal environment were fed the basal diet, and the birds in the HS groups were fed the basal diet supplemented with 0, 0.25, or 0.50 mg Se (as SeY) /kg diet for 28 days. Chronic HS decreased pH45min, increased lightness and drip loss, and impaired postmortem oxidative stability of breast muscle. The inclusion of SeY effectively reduced these stress-induced negative impacts, particularly on paleness, drip loss, and pH45min decline. The SeY significantly enhanced the cellular antioxidant defense system, suppressed the reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, and mitigated the mitochondrial damage and apoptosis of stressed muscle. In conclusion, dietary modification with SeY reduced quality loss and oxidative instability of meat from heat-stressed hens by maintaining a balanced mitochondrial redox status and inhibiting ROS induced myocyte apoptosis.

J		Bing Liu; Yue Qin; Meirong Cao; Haipeng Shi; Shijie Li; Wei Sheng; Shuo Wang							A stable and sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the determination of metsulfuron-methyl residues in foods.		Journal of Food Science					A hapten of metsulfuron-methyl was successfully designed and synthesized from 2-methylester-phenylsulfonamide and succinic anhydride, and the polyclonal antibody against metsulfuron-methyl was prepared by immunization procedure with the hapten-bovine serum albumin conjugate. A stable and sensitive direct competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dcELISA) method had been developed under the optimal conditions. The sensitivity (IC50) was 37.031.87 g/L, and the detection line (IC15) was 1.570.11 g/L. Rice, wheat, oat, flaxseed, milk, and water were chosen to study the recovery test and the recovery rates were 83.11%-117.44%. The matrix effect was eliminated by a simple dilution of the sample extracts. The results from dcELISA were well agreement with the results from HPLC-MS. It was indicated that the developed method had good accuracy and stability. It could be applied for the detection of metsulfuron-methyl residues. It was worth mentioning that the antibody could recognize metsulfuron-methyl and tribenuron-methyl with cross-reactivities of 100% and 49.72%, respectively. In order to understand the cross-reactivity, molecular modeling including molecular alignment and electrostatic potential surfaces were introduced. It was found that the special group of metsulfuron-methyl played an important role, especially on C3 position of the phenyl group. Practical Application. A stable, sensitive, and low-cost dc ELISA method had been developed with good accuracy and applied in the determination of metsulfuron-methyl in foods. Molecular simulation was introduced to understand the specificity between the antibody and the analyst. It was a good method to study the cross-reactivity between the antibody and the analyst or analogue. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	7	3176	3187	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15683					FSTA:2021-11-Cf3281
J		Bing Lu; Sun Jun; Yang Ning; Wu Xiaohong; Zhou Xin							Identification of tea white star disease and anthrax based on hyperspectral image information.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Hyperspectral images were used to identify the two similar diseases of tea white star disease and anthrax in this research. The average spectra of healthy leaves, white star disease, and anthrax leaves were collected, respectively. It was found that the average spectrum of white star disease and anthrax had strong morphological correlation and poor classification results. Then, the mask technology was used to segment the diseased region of leaves in order to get the best region of interest. After that, the average spectral separability of diseased region was significantly improved. Finally, through the comparison of the classification results between support vector machine and extreme learning machine (ELM), it was found that the ELM model based on neural network structure got the best identification results, and its classification accuracy reached 95.77%. This study provides a new method to identify similar diseases of leaf plants. Practical Applications. There is a certain similarity in disease characteristics between white star disease and anthracnose disease of tea. The similarity leads to a low accuracy in the classification and identification of diseases using hyperspectral technology. In order to solve this problem, this research proposed a spectrum extraction method based on the region of interest of the spots region. The experimental results showed that the average spectrum obtained from the leaf spots region could significantly improve the characterization of tea white star disease and anthrax, and the classification accuracy of the prediction model was significantly improved. This study provides a theoretical reference for the identification of tea similar diseases. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bing Niu; Hui Zhang; Guangya Zhou; Shuwen Zhang; Yunfeng Yang; Xiaojun Deng; Qin Chen							Safety risk assessment and early warning of chemical contamination in vegetable oil.		Food Control					Edible vegetable oil is a necessity in people's daily diet, and its safety has attracted the attention of the government and consumers. In recent years, the safety incidents of edible vegetable oil are reported, and the safety problems of edible vegetable oil caused by chemical hazards such as benzopyrene, heavy metal and aflatoxin B1 are more serious. In this research, a risk assessment model through dietary exposure assessment and margin of exposure (MOE) were built to assess the health risks of benzopyrene, aflatoxin B1, and heavy metals in edible vegetable oils. And then an early warning model of food oil safety risk was established by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and back propagation (BP) neural network. According to the national standards and sampling data, the risk early warning model determined eight evaluation indexes of vegetable oil quality and safety, and calculated the risk value of chemical pollution in vegetable oil by Entropy Weight-Analytic Hierarchy Process (EW-AHP). The data of eight evaluation indexes were taken as the input of the model, and the comprehensive risk value was taken as the output of the model. The model learning process was carried out, and four algorithms, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBF) and Neural Network (BP), were selected for construction and comparison of model. The daily sampling data of chemical hazard factors in edible vegetable oil were quantified into specific chemical hazard risk levels. Thus the goal of predicting chemical hazard levels was achieved in edible vegetable oil. This study provides targeted reference suggestions for the safety supervision of edible vegetable oil, so as to improve the efficiency of supervision and ensure the consumption safety of edible vegetable oil.

J		Bing Pang; Han Jin; Ning Liao; Junjun Li; Chunmei Jiang; Dongyan Shao; Junling Shi							Lactobacillus rhamnosus from human breast milk ameliorates ulcerative colitis in mice via gut microbiota modulation.		Food & Function					Gut microbiota imbalance is one of the major causes of ulcerative colitis (UC). L. rhamnosus SHA113 (LRS), a strain isolated from healthy human milk, influences the regulation of gut flora. This study aims to determine whether this strain can ameliorate UC by modulating gut microbiota. Mouse models of UC were established using C57BL/6Cnc mice with intragastric administration of 3.0% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). LRS was used to treat the mouse models of UC with 109 cfu mL-1 cell suspension via intragastric administration. To verify the effect of gut microbiota on UC, fecal microbiota collected from the mice after the treatment with LRS were also used to treat the UC mouse models (FMT). The severity of UC was evaluated based on body weight, colon length, disease activity index (DAI), and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The microbial composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. The mRNA expression levels of cytokines, mucins, tight junction proteins, and antimicrobial peptides in the gastrointestinal tract were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. The short-chain fatty acid (SCFAs) in the cecal contents of all mice were quantitatively detected by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Both LRS and FMT exerted excellent therapeutic effects on UC, as evidenced by the reduction in body weight loss, colon length, and colon structural integrity, as well as the increase in the DAI (disease activity index). LRS and FMT treatments showed similar effects: (1) an increase of total SCFA production in the cecal contents and the abundance of gut microbial diversity and flora composition; (2) decreases in two genera (Parabacteroides and Escherichia/ Shigella) related to the DAI and the enhancement of SCFAs and IL-10 positively related genera in the gut microbiota (Bilophila, Roseburia, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium); (3) downregulation of the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin IL-6, and IL-1beta, and upregulation of the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10; and (4) upregulation of the expression of mucins (Muc1-4) and tight junction protein ZO-1. Overall, L. rhamnosus SHA113 relieves UC via the regulation of gut microbiota: increases in SCFA-producing genera and decreases in UC-related genera. In addition, a single strain is sufficient to induce a significant change in the gut microbiota and exert therapeutic effects on UC. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	11	5171	5186	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03479g					FSTA:2021-10-Pe5127
J		Bing Pang; Han Jin; Ning Liao; Junjun Li; Chunmei Jiang; Junling Shi							Vitamin A supplementation ameliorates ulcerative colitis in gut microbiota-dependent manner.		Food Research International					Ulcerative colitis (UC), is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal track. The purpose of this study is to explore whether Vitamin A (VA) can treat UC and its mechanisms. A mouse model of UC was established using 3.0% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). VA was used to treat UC by intragastric administration of 5000 international unit (IU) retinyl acetate. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) was also used to treat the UC model mice to verify the effect of influenced gut microbiota. The content of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in cecal contents was quantitatively detected by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. VA supplementation significantly ameliorated UC. 16S rRNA sequencing indicated that VA-treated mice exhibited much more abundant gut microbial diversity and flora composition. Targeted metabolomics analysis manifested the increased production of SCFAs in VA-treated mice. Gut microbiota depletion and FMT results confirmed the gut microbiota-dependent mechanism as that VA relieved UC via regulating gut microbiota: increase in SCFA-producing genera and decrease in UC-related genera. The restore of intestinal barrier and the inhibition of inflammation were also found to contribute to the amelioration of UC by VA. It was concluded that a VA supplement was enough to cause a significant change in gut microbiota and amelioration of UC.

Food Research International					Milk compounds are important for human nutrient requirements and health. The ruminal metabolic profile is responsible for dietary nutrition and determines milk production. Perilla frutescens leaf (PFL) is a commonly used medicinal herb due to its bioactive metabolites. This study elucidated the effects of PFL on the metabolome of two biofluids (rumen fluid and milk) of 14 cows fed a basic total mixed ration diet (CON, n=7) and supplemented with 300 g/d PFL per cow (PFL, n=7) by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Milk PE-NMe (18:1 (9Z)/18:1 (9Z)) and DG (18:0/20:4 (5Z, 8Z, 11Z, 14Z) /0:0), oleanolic acid, and nucleotides were upregulated, and milk medium-chain fatty acids (2-hydroxycaprylic acid) were down-regulated in response to PFL. The supplementation of PFL increased the abundance of pyrimidine nucleotides both in rumen fluid and milk. The pathways of pyrimidine metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids were enriched both in the rumen fluid and milk. We also found the milk 2-hydroxycaprylic acid was positively correlated with ruminal uridine 5-monophosphate, and was negatively correlated with ruminal deoxycytidine, and the milk thymidine was positively correlated with ruminal icosenoic acid. This study found that the supplementation of PFL could alter the ruminal metabolic profiles and milk synthesis through regulation of the pathways of pyrimidine metabolism and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. Our new findings provide comprehensive insights into the metabolomics profile of rumen fluid and milk, supporting the potential production of Perilla frutescens milk in dairy cows.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Tan is a local fat-tail sheep that is famous for its great eating quality but with little attention to its meat metabolome. The aim of this study was to investigate Tan-lamb meat metabolome as well as the key rumen bacteria related to the beneficial compound deposition in the muscle using untargeted and targeted metabolomics under different feeding regimes: indoor feeding (F), artificial pasture grazing with indoor feeding (GF), and pure artificial pasture grazing (G). The untargeted metabolome was detected by ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Ruminal bacterial communities were detected by 16S rRNA sequencing. Using untargeted metabolomics, the main three altered metabolic pathways in the lamb, including amino acid, lipid, and nucleotide metabolisms, were found in the G group compared to the GF and F groups. Increased N-acetyl-L-aspartic acid, N-acetylaspartylglutamate, acetylcarnitine, and L-carnitine, but decreased carnosine and creatinine, were the main newly found G group-associated metabolites, which might contribute to the improved lamb meat functional quality. Compared to the F group, the G group feeding increased the contents of sweet amino acids (e.g., glycine, alanine, serine, and threonine) and umami amino acids (e.g., glutamic acid and aspartic acid) in the muscle, and G and GF groups increased the level of meat polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), especially the concentration of n3 PUFA, and reduced n6/n3 in the muscle by targeted metabolomics. The abundance of ruminal Moryella was decreased, and Schwartzia and Anaeroplasma were increased in the G group, which were both strongly correlated with the n3 PUFA and other functional compounds in the muscle of lambs. In conclusion, artificial pasture grazing modified the meat amino acid and fatty acid composition as well as the related biological pathways through rescheduling the rumen bacterial community, which would be a better selection for production of healthier lamb meat products.										2021	69	2	846	858	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06427					FSTA:2021-05-Sl2839

Food Chemistry					To prepared Maillard reaction products (MRPs) enriched with chicken flavor, the effects of chicken fats on peony seed-derived MRPs were evaluated. The thermal treatments, lipase enzymatic hydrolysis and lipoxygenase with subsequent mild thermal treatments were applied to oxidized chicken fats before their use in the Maillard reaction. Different oxidized chicken fats led to diverse chemical properties and varied volatile compounds. The addition of oxidized chicken fat increased the meaty of MRPs. The chicken fat promoted the Maillard reaction, which produced more oxygenated compounds; however, it reduced the sulfur compounds. Correlation analysis of the chemical properties of chicken fat and the major volatile compounds showed that by controlling the chemical properties of chicken fat, it might be possible to control the content of some volatile compounds of chicken fat and MRPs. Our data elucidated that chicken fat contributes to the development of meat flavors after oxidation and thermal treatments.

J		Bing Xia; Weida Wu; Li Zhang; Xiaobin Wen; Jingjing Xie; Hongfu Zhang							Gut microbiota mediates the effects of inulin on enhancing sulfomucin production and mucosal barrier function in a pig model.		Food & Function					Dietary fibers (DFs) have many beneficial effects on intestinal health by ameliorating intestinal inflammation and modulating the microbial community composition, thereby affecting the barrier function. This study aims to characterize the gut microbiota of pigs fed with DFs, revealing a link between the intestinal microbiota and mucin chemotypes. Pigs (six per group) were randomly allotted to consume one of the following diets: control (CON) or a diet supplemented with 5% microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) or inulin (INU) for 72 days. We found that INU but not MCC enhanced the colonic barrier function by promoting the expression of ZO-1, Occludin and MUC2 and reducing the colonic crypt depth. INU increased sulfomucin production and mRNA levels of sulfotransferases Gal3ST1 and Gal3ST2. Goblet cells in the ileum were found to contain predominantly sialomucins while colonic goblet cells were dominated by sulfomucins with sialomucins absent. DF consumption increased the concentrations of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) of the ileum and colon compared to the CON diet. Moreover, the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that DFs significantly altered the composition of ileal and colonic mucosal microbiota. Network analysis indicated that INU-induced changes in bacterial genera and SCFAs, such as Akkermansia and butyrate, were significantly related with sulfomucins and the mucosal barrier function-gene in pigs. Collectively, these findings suggest that the intestinal mucosal microbiota and SCFAs induced by INU play a crucial role in modulating the chemotypes of mucin and the barrier function. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	21	10967	10982	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo02582a					FSTA:2022-03-Tb0747
J		Bing Xiang; Xin Zhou; Danyang Qin; Jun Xi							Vesicle-enhanced liquid-phase pulsed discharge extraction of polyphenols from green tea leaves.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					A vesicle-enhanced liquid-phase pulsed discharge (V-LPD) was proposed to extract polyphenols from green tea leaves. The optimal extraction conditions obtained by the process optimization were 3% (w/ v) dodecyl trimethy lammonium bromide (DTAB) /sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) vesicle, 10% (v/v) ethanol/vesicle, 66 mL/g liquid-to-solid ratio, 5 kV discharge voltage, and 2.5 min extraction time. Under these optimal conditions, the polyphenols yield was 124.6501.197 mg/g, which was observably higher than that by heat reflux extraction (HRE) (108.1561.437 mg/g) for 45 min and that by ethanol-enhanced LPD (116.1231.164 mg/g) for 4 min. The energy consumptions of V-LDP and ethanol-enhanced LPD were far lower than that by HRE. Similar chemical constituents were observed by HPLC analysis in three extraction methods, and the extracts obtained by V-LPD had the highest antioxidant capacity. Therefore, the V-LPD is a time-saving and energy-saving method for the extraction of polyphenols. Industrial relevance Green tea is considered to be an important source of polyphenols. The potential of V-LPD has been demonstrated as a time-saving and energy-saving alternative using vesicle solvents for the simultaneous cell disruption and strengthening diffusion of polyphenols from green tea leaves.

J		Bing Xie; Chen Ling; Shunqing Hu; Yuanyuan Hou; Yonghua Zheng; Peng Jin							CaM enhances chilling tolerance of peach fruit by regulating energy and GABA metabolism.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The effects of calcium chloride (CaCl2), calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine (TFP) and different storage temperatures on chilling injury (CI) of peach fruit during postharvest storage were studied. The results showed that 0 °C storage and CaCl2 treatment reduced the CI index, reduced the ion leakage and maintained the integrity of cell membrane. Storage at 0°C and CaCl2 treatment increased calmodulin (CaM) expression and protein content, energy charge (EC), adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) content. At the same time, it also promoted the expression and activity of Ca2+-ATPase and other enzymes related to energy metabolism. In addition, storage at 0°C and CaCl2 treatment promoted the expression and activity of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), and increased the content of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and the expression of GABA transaminase (GABA-T). On the contrary, TFP treatment significantly increased CI index and ion leakage, significantly inhibited PpCaM expression and protein content, and decreased EC and GABA content. Moreover, the molecular properties of PpCaM were studied. The results showed that PpCaM was a highly conserved hydrophilic protein, located on the nucleus and plasma membrane. PpCaM could induce the expression of PpCa2+-ATPase, increase the activity of Ca2+-ATPase, and participate in the regulation of energy metabolism. In addition, PpCaM could activate the activity of PpGAD, promote the synthesis of GABA, and participate in the regulation of GABA metabolism. These results suggested that 0°C storage and CaCl2 treatment promoted the expression of PpCaM and increased the protein content of PpCaM, suggesting PpCaM enhanced the cold resistance and reduced the occurrence of CI by participating in the regulation of energy metabolism and GABA metabolism.

J		Bing Xu; Shengjun Wu							Preservation of mango fruit quality using fucoidan coatings.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Fucoidan has coating forming ability and antibacterial activity. This study aims to investigate the effects of fucoidan coatings on the shelf-life of mango fruits. Fucoidan coatings of different concentrations (1%, 3% and 5%) were used to extend the shelf life of mango fruits at room temperature (temperature ~20 °C, humidity ~80%), and a blank control experiment was conducted. Optimum preservation effects of fucoidan coatings on mango fruits were observed at the highest concentration of fucoidan. At the highest dose, fucoidan coatings delayed the respiratory peak by three days, and the respiratory peak even appeared one week later. After 35 days of storage under room-temperature conditions, the mango fruits had a weight loss rate of 5.91%, the fruit decay incidence was 14.2%, the ascorbic acid content was 19.14 mg/100 g, the soluble solid content was 19.73%, the hardness was 0.77 Kg, the titratable acid content was 0.52% and overall acceptability was 7.3. Results indicated that fucoidan coatings can effectively extend the shelf life of mango fruits.

Improvement of vitamin C stability in vitamin gummies by encapsulation in casein gel.		Food Hydrocolloids					Vitamin gummies have gained popularity in recent years due to ease of swallowing, appealing appearance, and tasty flavors. Water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C are susceptible to degradation when exposed to oxygen, moisture, light, heat, and change in pH during manufacturing and shelf life. Therefore, it is essential to improve vitamin stability and delay the degradation process. In this study, microencapsulation of vitamin C inside casein gel followed by spray drying produced vitamin C capsules in powder form referred to as micro cheese powder (MCP). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results confirmed an increase in hydrogen bonding between vitamin C and casein, as well as vitamin C and the gummy. In addition, Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation technology was utilized to provide insights into the physical interaction between micellar casein, rennet treated casein, and vitamin C. The storage studies showed that microcapsules integrated into the gummy retained 92% of vitamin C during accelerated tests within a ten-week period, while the unencapsulated vitamin C in the gummy only retained 79%. In addition, compared to the unencapsulated vitamin C in the gummy, encapsulated vitamin C in the gummy showed better retention of vitamin C and color at different temperatures, humidity, and light conditions. MCP showed slower release and better protection of vitamin C from gummy in the simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and simulated intestinal fluid (SIF). The developed vitamin C microencapsulation is promising to improve the stability of water-soluble vitamins in gummies during processing and storage.

J		Bing Yang; Yue Tan; Jianquan Kan							Determination and mitigation of chemical risks in sufu by NaCl and ethanol addition during fermentation.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This work investigated the changes in the risk factors associated with sufu fermentation, and the effects of NaCl and ethanol content on biogenic amine precursors and biogenic amines. The results demonstrated that all physicochemical indexes of sufu in the fermentation process met the standard limits. High NaCl concentration had a significant effect on the decrease of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) and biogenic amine in sufu at the curing stage. Furthermore, cadaverine and histamine contents were significantly reduced with increasing NaCl content. During the post-fermentation stage, H2S, TVB-N and total biogenic amine contents significantly decreased with high concentrations of ethanol. In addition, 16 % ethanol content had a significant effect on the putrescine, cadaverine and histamine contents. These results demonstrated that suitable concentrations of salt and ethanol could be used to produce high-quality sufu products with low biogenic amine content.

J		Bing Yang; Xunyu Wei; Yuxin Luo; Jianquan Kan							Hypoglycemic effect of low-sugar juice derived from Hovenia dulcis on type 1 diabetes mellitus rats.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Fruit juice is usually rich in monosaccharides and disaccharides. A reverse osmosis separation machine was used to remove monosaccharides and disaccharides from Hovenia dulcis fruit juice, leaving behind most of the bioactive substances in a low-sugar fruit juice (LSFJ), so as to provide a more effective treatment for diabetic patients. Method. This study was carried out with type 1 diabetes mellitus model induced with high dose of streptozotocin (60mgkg-1), and oral administration of LSFJ for 4weeks. Results. LSFJ treatment led to significant gain in body weight and increased serum insulin level, insulin-like growth factor-1 level, blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine level, and hepatic glycogen level. Meanwhile, fasting blood glucose, fructosamine level, and glucose tolerance were also observably enhanced. Additional, LSFJ treatment significantly improved lipid metabolism, islet quality, and islet oxidative stress. The messenger RNA levels of glucose metabolism genes in the pancreas of diabetic rats decreased in the diabetes model group, whereas messenger RNA expression of these genes was significantly increased with LSFJ treatment. Conclusion. These findings indicate that LSFJ can improve symptoms associated with type1 diabetes mellitus. The research also suggests new strategies for diabetes prevention and treatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	11	4818	4828	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11128					FSTA:2021-10-Jg14366
J		Bing Zhao; Baoguo Sun; Shouwei Wang; Yuyu Zhang; Mingwu Zang; Wang Le; Hui Wang; Qianrong Wu							Effect of different cooking water on flavor characteristics of mutton soup.		Food Science & Nutrition					The mutton flavor is affected by cooking water significantly, and the flavor of mutton is delicious and widely loved by consumers through an extremely simple processing in northwest China, such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Xinjiang. The flavor shows obvious changes if get out of these areas even use the same raw meat, which may be caused by different cooking water. To determine whether and how the cooking water affect the mutton soup flavor, the elements in water, the flavor was studied by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), amino acid analyzer, and thermal desorption (TDS)-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Specifically, three water samples from different sources, Ningxia (NXW), Beijing (BJW), and ultrapure water from the laboratory (PUW), were used for cooking with Tan sheep's ribs to get different mutton soups. The inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) results showed that the elements and the concentration of solutes in different water sources were significantly different. The NXW batch had the highest Na, Mg, K, and Sr concentrations, and Na in NXW water reached to 50.60mg/L, which existed as Na+, significantly (p<.05) higher than BJW (8.63mg/L) and PUW, which were important to the flavor of mutton soup. The PUW batch had the highest content of free amino acids, and the content of glutamic acid (Glu) reached to 17.89mug/mL. The NXW batch had the highest content of taste nucleotides, and the content of 5'-IMP reached to 68.68mug/ml. The volatiles of the three batches had significant differences, and only 40 volatiles were detected in all batches. Further flavor studies using electronic nose and electronic tongue showed significant differences in overall aroma and overall taste, especially bitterness, saltiness, and astringency. The results could provide a basis for improving the flavor quality for the mutton soup. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Bing Zhou; Zhao Jin; Schwarz, P. B.; Yin Li							Effect of grinding and extraction conditions on the determination of antioxidant activity and phenolic acids in barley.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In the present study, the objective was to evaluate the effects of barley kernel size, grind level, and extract solvent on the antioxidant activities associated with total phenolic content and phenolic acid compositions. Three barley varieties (Kindred, Azure, and Tradition), were used and the results showed that with the exception of superoxide anion radical scavenging activity, thin kernel size fraction (2.0 mm) showed much higher antioxidant activities and total phenolic content than those in the 2.4 mm and 2.8 mm fractions when averaged across barley cultivar, grind level, and extract solvent. A similar trend was found for individual phenolic acid compositions among kernel sizes. Simple correlation analysis revealed that total phenolic content showed strong correlation with DPPH. scavenging activity, ABTS+scavenging activity, and reducing power. Generally, fine grind and 80% acetone extract showed averaged highest values in antioxidant activities, total phenolic content, and individual phenolic acid compositions. Stepwise linear regression showed that extract solvent was the most important factor for DPPH. Scavenging activity, ABTS+ scavenging activity, reducing power, and iron chelating activity. The sum of syringic acid and caffeic acid exhibited a dominant role in explaining the major variation in antioxidant activities except for superoxide anion radical scavenging activity. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	15	4	3823	3836	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00964-0					FSTA:2021-12-Mg7876

Food Science & Nutrition					Recent studies suggested that vitamin D is linked with obesity, but evidence in infants is scarce. Therefore, we aimed to make an exploration in infants. A total of 414 infants at one year old who visited Maternity and Child Health Care Hospital of Wuxi in China were recruited. Finger-stick blood sampling was conducted in all the subjects, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25 (OH) D] concentrations were measured. Maternal characteristics during pregnancy and infantile information were collected by questionnaires or extracting from medical records. Multivariable linear models were performed to assess the relationship between 25 (OH) D and body mass index (BMI), while multivariable logistic regression models were used to examine the association between 25 (OH) D and obesity. Among the 414 infants, 69 (16.67%) and 81 (19.57%) infants were defined as obesity and vitamin D deficiency [25 (OH) D < 50 nmol/L], respectively. The mean (SD) of 25 (OH) D concentration was 68.05 (19.05) in infants without obesity, which was significantly higher than that of obese infants [60.36 (18.49), p = .002]. Inverse linear relationships were observed between 25 (OH) D level and BMI (beta = -0.017, p = .004) as well as BMI Z-score (beta = -0.010, p = .004). Furthermore, vitamin D deficiency was associated with an increased risk of obesity of infants (adjusted odds ratio = 2.74,95% confidence interval = 1.20-6.25, with 25 (OH) D ≥ 75 nmol/L as a reference). The results showed that serum 25 (OH) D concentrations were significantly lower in infants with obesity, suggesting vitamin D deficiency may be an independent risk factor for obesity among one-year-old Chinese infants. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Bingbing Ma; Lin Zhang; Jiaolong Li; Tong Xing; Yun Jiang; Feng Gao							Dietary taurine supplementation ameliorates muscle loss in chronic heat stressed broilers via suppressing the perk signaling and reversing endoplasmic reticulum-stress-induced apoptosis.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Heat stress seriously affects animal health and induces enormous financial losses in poultry production. Exploring the appropriate means for ameliorating unfavorable effects caused by heat stress is essential. We investigated whether taurine supplementation could attenuate breast muscle loss in chronic heat-stressed broilers, as well as its mechanism. We designed three groups: a normal control group (22 °C), a heat stress group (32 °C) and a taurine treatment group (32 °C, basal diet + 5g.kg-1 taurine). Results. We found that taurine significantly moderated the decreases of breast muscle mass and yield, as well as the increases of serum aspartate aminotransferase activity and serum urine acid level in chronic heat-stressed broilers. Additionally, supplementary taurine significantly alleviated elevations of the cytoplasm Ca2 + concentration, protein expressions of GRP78 and p-PERK, mRNA expressions of Ca2 + channels (RyR1, IP3R3) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress factors (GRP78, GRP94, PERK, EIF2alpha, ATF4, IRE1, XBP1, ATF6 and CHOP), apoptosis (Caspase-3 and TUNEL), protein catabolism, and the reduction of taurine transporter (TauT) mRNA expression in the breast muscle induced by chronic heat stress. Conclusion. Supplementary taurine could attenuate chronic heat stress-induced breast muscle loss via reversing ER stress-induced apoptosis and suppressing protein catabolism. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	5	2125	2134	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10835					FSTA:2021-07-Sn3559
J		Bingfeng Wang; Xue Wang; Jun Bei; Lei Xu; Xinlian Zhang; Zhenzhen Xu							Development and validation of an analytical method for the quantification of arabinose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, fructose, and maltose in fruits, vegetables, and their products.		Food Analytical Methods					The paper presents a method for the simultaneous determination of arabinose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, fructose, and maltose in fruits, vegetables, and their products using ion chromatography-pulsed amperometric detection on a gold working electrode. Sample preparation involved simple extraction, dilution with water, and filtration before injection into the system. Separation of the analytes was performed with gradient elution on a Thermo Scientific CarboPac PA20 Analytical Column (3.0*150 mm) and a Guard column (2 mm*50 mm) with a mobile phase. The optimized parameters were an eluent concentration of 10 mmol/L, a column temperature of 30 °C, and a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. In methodological evaluation, parameters (selectivity, linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), relative standard deviation (RSD), recovery percentages, and CV%) resulted in compliance with reference values at each level of fortification. All validation parameters were acceptable in the characterization of sugars in fruits, vegetables, and their products. After method validation, we analyzed the sugar content in fresh and dried jujube. The method was accurate, reliable, and reproducible and can be used for the determination of arabinose, galactose, glucose, sucrose, fructose and maltose in fruits, vegetables, and their products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	6	1227	1238	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-01964-y					FSTA:2021-11-Ja14552
J		Binggeli, S.; Lapierre, H.; Charbonneau, E.; Ouellet, D. R.; Pellerin, D.							Economic and environmental effects of revised metabolizable protein and amino acid recommendations on Canadian dairy farms.		Journal of Dairy Science					The objective of this research was to evaluate the potential economic and environmental effects of the formulation model used to balance dairy rations for metabolizable protein (MP) or 3 essential AA (EAA: His, Lys, and Met) in 3 regions of Canada with different farming systems. The Maritimes, Central Canada, and the Prairies reference dairy farms averaged 63, 71, 144 mature cows per herd and 135, 95, 255 ha of land, respectively. Using N-CyCLES, a whole-farm linear program model, dairy rations were balanced for (1) MP, based on National Research Council (NRC) requirements (MP_2001); (2) MP plus Lys and Met, based on NRC (AA_2001); (3) MP (MP_Rev); or (4) for His, Lys, and Met (AA_Rev), both based on a revised factorial approach revisiting both supply and requirements of MP and EAA. Energy was balanced to meet requirements based on NRC (2001). Assuming the requirements were met within each approach, it was considered that milk yield and composition were not affected by the type of formulation. Given the assumptions of the study, when compared with MP_2001 formulation, balancing dairy rations using the AA_Rev approach reduced calculated farm N balance by 3.8%, on average from 12.71 to 12.24 g/kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk; it also enhanced farm net income by 4.5%, from 19.00 to 19.70 $CAN/100 kg of fat- and protein-corrected milk, by reducing inclusion of protein concentrate in dairy rations. Calculated animal N efficiency was on average 4.3% higher with AA_Rev than with MP_2001 for mid-lactation cows. This gain in N efficiency would result in a reduction in N2O emission by manure, contributing to a partial decrease of total greenhouse gas emission by 1.7%, through a reduction of N excreted in manure. With the AA_2001 formulation, farm N balance was 1% higher than with MP_2001 formulation while reducing farm net income by 6.4%, due to the need to purchase rumen-protected AA, with no effect on total greenhouse gas emission. Both MP formulations lead to fairly similar outputs. The AA_Rev formulation also indicated that His might be a co-limiting AA with Met in dairy rations balanced with ingredients usually included in Canadian dairy rations. Given the assumptions of the study, balancing dairy rations for 3 EAA (His, Lys, and Met) rather than MP, has some potential positive effects on Canadian dairy farms by increasing net incomes through a reduction of crude protein supply, leading to a decreased environmental effect.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, the electronic tongue, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and multivariate statistical methods were used to explore the characteristic taste of preserved egg yolk. The results of the electronic tongue showed that the prominent characteristic taste of preserved egg yolk was umami, and there existed significant differences in metabolites between preserved egg yolk and fresh raw yolk according to UHPLC-MS/MS results. Combined with principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) and partial least square analysis (PLS), the umami flavor profile of preserved egg yolk was obtained. Glutamic acid (Glu), aspartic acid (Asp), nucleotides, succinic acid, betaine, glutamyl peptides and their derivatives were considered to be the important components of umami substances in preserved egg yolk. Other substances such as carnosine, glutamine and lipids may promote its umami taste retention. Interestingly, it was also found that the change of lipids had a certain effect on the umami taste of preserved egg yolk. Consequently, we explored the characteristic flavor of preserved egg yolk and provided metabolite information of its related umami-producing substances.

J		Bingjie Liu; Lingfeng Lai; Bertrand Muhoza; Shuqin Xia							Complex coacervates based on gelatin and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as carriers for cinnamaldehyde: effect of gelatin Bloom values on coacervates formation and interfacial properties.		Food Bioscience					The formation and interfacial property of complex coacervates were characterized based on CMC and gelatin with different Bloom values (140, 180, 200, 220, and 240). Gelatins with higher Bloom values had more alpha-chains and beta-chains as well as more triple-helix structures. The turbidity curve and optimal pH point for electrostatic neutralization between CMC and gelatin were dependent on the Bloom value. The complex coacervate with medium Bloom values (200) and mass ratio (gelatin/CMC 9:1) showed higher yield (87.56%) and more uniform spherical microstructure, which was correlated with appropriate binding sites and steric hindrance of gelatin. The existence of gelatin with the lower Bloom value enhanced the emulsifying activity of complex coacervates by decreasing the interfacial tension to 16.4 mN/m. However, higher Bloom value was beneficial to the emulsifying stability of the complex coacervates with the ESI up to 21.3 min. With the increasing of molecular weight, the stability of the coacervate exhibited an increasing trend for the higher thickness of the interface film. When used gelatin (200, Bloom value) for microencapsulating cinnamaldehyde, the thermal stability improved significantly and core material uniformly released compared with unencapsulated cinnamaldehyde.

J		Bingjing Zheng; Hualu Zhou; McClements, D. J.							Nutraceutical-fortified plant-based milk analogs: bioaccessibility of curcumin-loaded almond, cashew, coconut, and oat milks.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Plant-based milk analogs often contain oil bodies, which are natural colloidal particles comprising of a triglyceride-rich core coated by a phospholipid/protein shell. Hydrophobic nutraceuticals, such as curcumin, can be encapsulated within these oil bodies utilizing a simple pH-driven method. Previously, we loaded curcumin into the oil bodies in soymilk using this approach. Here, we show this method is highly versatile and can be utilized to incorporate curcumin into other plant-based milk analogs (coconut, cashew, almond, and oat milks). Initially, the impact of pH-driven loading on the physicochemical attributes of the milk analogs was investigated. Curcumin bioaccessibility in the milk analogs was then ascertained using a simulated gastrointestinal tract. Curcumin was successfully loaded into all the milk analogs without causing adverse effects on oil body properties or stability. Curcumin had a high encapsulation efficiency (>86%) in all milk analogs, which was attributed to its localization inside the oil bodies. The curcumin-loaded plant-based milks had fairly similar bioaccessibilities (>60%), which were much higher than those seen for a crystalline form of the curcumin (about 5%). The information obtained may be utilized to facilitate the creation of the next-generation of nutritionally fortified plant-based milk analogs.

J		Bingjun Qian; Lei Huang; Jing Zhao; Juan Zhu							Analysis of physiochemical composition and antioxidant properties between hulls of the genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant soybean and northeast soybean.		Food Science and Biotechnology					In this study, the physiochemical and antioxidant properties of the soybean hulls from the genetically modified glyphosate-tolerant soybeans (line 40-3-2) and local cultivar northeast soybeans were investigated. The levels of fat, total phenolic, total extractable pectin and soluble dietary fiber in northeast soybeans hulls were less than that in glyphosate-tolerant soybeans hulls, respectively. The antioxidant capacity of total phenolic, water soluble pectin, and soluble dietary fiber showed that DPPH free radical scavenging activities of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans hulls were 118.23, 57.34 and 197.22 mug AAE/g, which were 2.3, 1.2 and 9.4 times of northeast soybeans hulls, respectively (p<0.05), and FRAP of glyphosate-tolerant soybeans hulls were 401.67, 747.51 and 328.53 mug AAE/g, which were 1.8, 8.7 and 4.8 times of northeast soybeans hulls (p<0.05). Glyphosate-tolerant soybeans hulls extract showed the stronger antioxidant activity, which was positively correlated with total phenolic content (r=0.890, p=0.001). It provides evidence on developing value-added utilization of hulls, soybean processing by-products, as nutraceuticals or functional food ingredients. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	4	505	512	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00894-z					FSTA:2021-08-Jn9994

Food Chemistry					As one of the medicine homologous foods in China, Atractylodis Macrocephalae Rhizoma (AMR) is usually distributed after thermal processing, which raised the possibility of acrylamide pollution and a potential carcinogenic risk. In this study, a method was developed for the determination of the acrylamide in AMR using graphited multiwalled carbon nanotubes as the dispersive solid phase extraction sorbent and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The concentration of acrylamide was investigated at processing conditions of 80 °C -210 °C and 5 min -100 min. Method validation results demonstrated the reliability of the method with good linearity, accuracy and precision. Significant increment of acrylamide was found in AMR after thermal processing with the highest concentration at 9826 mug/kg, which led to a margin of exposure at 90.83-181.7 according to the BMDL10 of carcinogenicity at 0.17 mg/kg, indicating a high health risk of taking thermally processed AMR, and monitoring and controlling should be considered.

Journal of Functional Foods					The study evaluated the capacity of taurine on insulin resistance amelioration in HepG2 cells induced by BSA and palmitic acid (PA) and diabetes-related metabolic changes in type 2 diabetic rats. In vitro, taurine alleviated insulin resistance in HepG2 cells, increased glucose consumption and improved oxidative stress. Further, taurine could up-regulate the expression of PI3K, Akt and GLUT4, which could improve insulin resistance. In vivo, taurine supplementation markedly regulated blood glucose and improved the oxidative stress in T2DM rats. The improvement of related metabolic parameters and oxidative stress was in part associated with the impact of taurine on activating PI3K, Akt and GLUT4 in liver. In summary, the finding suggested that taurine have potential benefits on improving dysfunction in diabetes rats and mitigating insulin resistance in HepG2 cells via activation of PI3K/Akt/GLUT4 pathways.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The objective of this paper was to evaluate the combinational effect of different durations of anaerobic treatment and perforation mediated modified atmosphere packaging on the respiration, color, texture, sensory, and amino acid contents of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms stored under 5 °C. The anaerobic condition was created by flushing N2 for 6,12, and 24 h into a plastic tray sealed with perforated film containing the mushroom samples. The results showed that 6 h treatment combined with perforation mediated MAP was the most effective to maintain the quality of mushrooms, including the appearance, texture, and sensory quality. It reduced the respiration rate by 47.5% on day 3 compared to control (no anaerobic treatment) and maintained the weight loss under 1.6% during 15 d storage. Extending the treatment to 24 h accelerated the deterioration of mushroom quality, indicating that extended anaerobic treatment caused irreversible damage to mushroom cells.

Food Chemistry					The effects of heat treatment on the proteome of Apostichopus japonicus have been evaluated using label-free quantitative proteomics by ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole/time of flight (UHPLC-Q/TOF) mass spectrometry with sequential window acquisition of all the theoretical fragment ion (SWATH) acquisition mode. Chemometric tools are integrated to reveal proteomic changes by mining the protein quantitation data from fresh and differently heat-treated samples. SWATH allows the quantitation of 548 proteins, of which 24 proteins are significantly sensitive to heat treatment and 13 proteins vary significantly responding to different heat procedures (boiling, steaming, and microwave heating), and 5 of them are sharing proteins. Gene ontology (GO) annotation of the differentiating proteins highlights most of them are relevant to molecular functions. The results can be favorable to evaluate the effects of heat treatment on the nutrition and function of processed sea cucumbers and facilitate the selection of an optimal thermal treatment.

Food Chemistry					The effects of selenium (Se) addition methods on antioxidant activity and flavor properties of fermented Pleurotus eryngii (P. eryngii) using Lactobacillus plantarum (L. plantarum) inoculated and natural fermentation were investigated. After fermentation, the Se-enrichment rates in fruiting bodies of Se-added fermented P. eryngii were all more than 50%. Se addition, especially in the form of Se-enriched L. plantarum inoculation, had a significantly positive effect on total phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity. Non-volatiles analysis revealed that the highest ration of lactic acid to acetic acid and the highest umami intensity were observed in P. eryngii fermented by inoculating Se-enriched L. plantarum (Lp-Se). Principal components analysis and cluster analysis of volatiles clearly separated Se-treated and plain experiments, which mainly due to dissimilarities in alcohols, aldehydes and ketones. Additionally, Lp-Se obtained the highest alcohols, especially 1-octen-3-ol with mushroom flavor. In short, Se-enriched L. plantarum inoculation could produce high-quality fermented P. eryngii.

Xin1.		Food Control					In recent years, bacteriocins have attracted considerable interest for use as natural food preservatives against spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms. Recent studies have shown that the strains of Bacillus cereus group produce a range of highly diverse bacteriocins. In this study, we screened a large number of Bacillus cereus group strains and isolated one strain, Bacillus sp. Xin1, with antimicrobial activity against several food-borne pathogens. A novel circular bacteriocin, bacicyclicin XIN-1 (MW: 5848.1719 Da), was purified from the culture supernatant of Bacillus sp. Xin1. This bacteriocin exhibited high thermal stability, wide pH tolerance, and a wide range of antimicrobial activities against Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Staphylococcus aureus, three important foodborne pathogens, as well as other pathogens. Bacicyclicin XIN-1 also inhibited the outgrowth of Bacillus cereus spores and did not show hemolysis activity. Bacicyclicin XIN-1 effectively inhibited or eliminated B. cereus ATTCC14579, S. aureus ATCC6538, and L. monocytogenes LM201 in skim milk. Our findings indicate that bacicyclicin XIN-1 has a remarkable potential for use as a natural food preservative in the food industry.

Food & Function					Corni Fructus (CF) is a traditional medicine and beneficial food with multifaceted protective effects against diabetes and its complications. Since alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (GIs) are promising first-choice oral antihyperglycemic drugs for diabetes, we examined whether GIs from CF (GICF) are useful for diabetes treatment. Therefore, GICF was extracted by ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) that is optimized by a three-level, four-factor Box-Behnken design and determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography. Compared to 36.31 mg g-1 without enzyme treatment, the GICF yield increased to 70.44 mg g-1via UAEE under optimum conditions (0.5% compound enzyme extracted in 23 min at 46 °C and pH 4.8). The activity (91.99%) of GICF was as predicted (93.28%). When GICF was used in an insulin-resistant HepG2 cell model, it significantly ameliorated the glucose metabolism in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings indicate that UAEE may be an innovative method for functional food extraction and a potential strategy for high-quality food ingredient (such as GI) production with high efficiency and productivity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	9808	9819	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01002f					FSTA:2022-02-Te0497

Food Bioscience					Quality loss of frozen dough products were mainly attributed to ice recrystallisation on gluten and yeast activity during frozen storage. Little was reported on role of sourdough metabolites and acidification on gluten protein behavior during frozen storage of dough. Here, the effects of in situ formed exopolysaccharide (EPS) in red bean sourdough fermented by Weissella confusa QS813 and sourdough acidification on gluten protein matrix and quality of frozen gluten-red bean dough was investigated during 0, 1, and 5 freeze-thaw cycles (FTC). Underlying mechanisms were explored to compare changes in gluten, water distribution, rheological and microstructural properties of frozen gluten-red bean dough during FTC. Gluten protein conformation analysis showed that EPS in sourdough and sourdough acidification reduced rate of increase of glutenin macropolymer (GMP) depolymerization (3.07%), GMP content (0.88%), and free sulfhydryl content in frozen gluten-red bean doughs during FTC. Secondary structure analysis showed that beta-turns increased while alpha-helix and beta-sheet structures decreased in frozen gluten-red bean doughs with sourdough during FTC. EPS in red bean sourdough reduced water distribution by enhancing water binding capacity. This suggested that EPS probably formed bonds with gluten and red bean components like proteins, resulting in a dough structurally tolerant to distortions caused by ice recrystallisation during FTC. Furthermore, synergistic interactions between EPS and acidification improved viscoelastic properties and stabilized microstructural integrity of frozen gluten-red bean doughs. These findings gave new insights and suggested potential clean label application of sourdough fermentation to enhance legume ingredient functionality in frozen dough products in bakery food industry.

Food Chemistry					Gaultheria longibracteolata (Ericaceae) has been traditionally used by different linguistic groups in Yunnan Province, China, but it has not been well studied. Through our ethnobotanical study in Luchun County of Yunnan, we found that this species has multiple traditional uses including food, medicine, and worship. The essential oils from the root, stem, and leaf were investigated by both GC-MS and anti-bacterial assays. The GC-MS study showed that methyl salicylate is the main (>90%) component of the essential oil, and the oil composition extracted from different plant parts showed some similarities. The oil of G. longibracteolata displayed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, which is likely due to its methyl salicylate content. Gautheria longbracteolata appears to be a useful natural wintergreen oil substitute, but further studies are needed to develop this product.

Foods					Robiola di Roccaverano is a Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese from the Piedmont region of Italy. In this study, the mycobiota occurring during Robiola di Roccaverano production was elucidated. Samples of milk, Natural Milk Cultures (NMC), curd, 5- and 15-days ripened cheese were collected from one dairy plant and the mycobiota was analyzed by the metataxonomic approach. Milk samples showed a high diversity and Cladosporium, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Geotrichum candidum and Debaryomyces hansenii were found with higher relative abundance. This mycobiota remains quite stable in NMC and curd matrices although the relative abundance of K. marxianus and G. candidum yeasts increased significantly and shaped the fungal composition of 5- and 15-day ripened cheese. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Biplab Bandyopadhyay; Kumar Mitra, P.; Vivekananda Mandal; Chandra Mandal, N.							Novel fructooligosaccharides of Dioscorea alata L. tuber have prebiotic potentialities.		European Food Research and Technology					Dioscorea alata L. (Dioscoreaceae), commonly known as water yam, is a popular tuber crop vegetable used across the globe. It is mainly composed of starch (75-84% of the dry weight) with a small amount of proteins, lipids, and vitamins and is very rich in minerals. It has nutritional superiority compared with other tropical root crops. The main aim of the study was to extract and characterize the fructooligosaccharides (FOSs) fractions from the tuber of this plant and evaluate their prebiotic properties. The soluble FOSs were fractionated by the conventional solid-phase extraction method and were characterized by FT-IR, HPTLC, and ESI-MS analyses. In addition, the beneficial health attributes of these fractions were checked for in vitro and in vivo prebiotic properties in Swiss albino mice. The FT-IR, HPTLC, and ESI-MS analyses of the FOSs from the hot water and 80% ethanol fractions showed that both are rich in inulin-like prebiotics. Furthermore, these FOSs showed an excellent prebiotic activity score and had enhanced in vitro cholesterol-binding activities in the presence of probiotic lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains. Moreover, these had good antioxidant efficacies with IC50 values of 36.51 g/ml and 33.12 g/ml. In vivo treatment in Swiss albino mice, these FOSs had significantly lowered serum cholesterol (df= 6, p value < 2.2e-16), serum HDL (df = 6, p value = 3.68e-11), serum LDL (df= 6, p value < 2e-16), serum VLDL (df = 6, p value = 2.2e-13), serum triglycerides (df= 6, p value < 2e-16), blood sugar (df = 6, p value = 0.01857), serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (S. G. P. T., df= 6, p value = 0.01189), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (S. G. O. T., df= 6, p value = 0.01239) but no significant difference found in weight gain (df= 6, p value = 0.166) and serum creatinine (df = 6, p value = 0.987). Furthermore, they enhanced IgA-mediated immunomodulation and influenced the gut colonization of probiotic LAB strains than the standard prebiotics, inulin. Thus, the study revealed that the FOSs from the storage tuber of D. alata possess some novel prebiotic that could contribute to human nutrition. This is the first report of the prebiotic FOS characterization from this plant. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	12	3099	3112	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03872-1					FSTA:2022-03-Jk2442
J		Biplab Bandyopadhyay; Vivekananda Mandal; Narayan C. Mandal							Partial characterization of novel inulin-like prebiotic fructooligosaccharides of Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae) tuberous roots.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The fruits and aerial parts of Sechium edule (Jacq.) Sw. (Cucurbitaceae) are a popular cook vegetable being used in different parts of the world with ethnomedicinal and pharmacological values. However, the beneficial health attributes of the tuberous roots have been less exploited. The present study aimed to determine the prebiotic potentiality of the storage carbohydrates from this part. The carbohydrate fractions were harvested by hot-water, cold-water, hot-acid, hot-alkali, and hot 80% ethanol treatments following the standard protocol. The fractions were tested for in vitro prebiotic efficacy, hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant potentials, and in vivo health attributes in Swiss albino mice. The partial characterization was performed by high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) and spectroscopic analyses by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The highest prebiotic index was observed in hot-water and ethanol (Et-OH) fractions with the antioxidant IC50 values of 35.460.33 and 32.560.48 g/ml, respectively. The HPTLC, FT-IR, and ESI-MS analyses showed that the hot-water and Et-OH carbohydrate fractions are rich in low-degree polymerizing inulin-like fructooligosaccharides (FOS). The fractions had a significant prebiotic index, hypocholesterolemic, and antioxidant activities. The synbiotic combination of the fractions with the probiotic LAB improved gut colonization and gut immune enhancement with significantly lowered triglycerides, serum LDL, and serum VLDL cholesterols. A significantly enhanced HDL cholesterol level proves its health beneficial attributes comparable to the commercial inulin prebiotics. Thus, this plant's novel inulin-like FOS may substitute the high-cost commercial prebiotics for our daily life. Practical applications. Prebiotics are low-degree polymerizing oligosaccharide food ingredients having multifaceted health benefits. For this reason, there is an ever-increasing global demand for such novel prebiotics. Therefore, finding out some novel prebiotic from conventional food sources may provide an alternative dietary source to fulfill the consumer demand. Sechium edule is a famous cook vegetable used by many ethnic communities across the globe. For the first time, the study revealed novel inulin-like fructooligosaccharides in the tuberous roots having hypocholesterolemic and synbiotic efficacy with GRAS lactic acid bacteria. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13764					FSTA:2021-10-Jq13744
J		Birkett, H.; Gomez, I. P.; Stein, J.							Evaporator and heater performance monitoring.		International Sugar Journal					In 2019, one Louisiana factory installed the necessary equipment to accurately determine the heat transfer coefficients (HTCs), the condensate flow rate, and the temperature difference of the individual effects over an entire operating cycle of the last three effects of a quadruple-effect evaporator station. To achieve these goals, it was necessary to install condensate flow meters, calandria steam temperature thermometers, and thermometers to measure the boiling temperature of the juice (or syrup) in the effect for each of the three bodies. The degree of the decline in the HTCs can be used to indicate the degree of tube fouling and the necessary cleaning time and/or cleaning chemical concentration requirements for individual bodies. Since the condensate flow from an effect is approximately equal to the evaporation from the vessel, the total evaporation achieved can be readily obtained. For the 2020 crop, the factory installed equipment to determine the HTCs on two additional evaporator sets as well as started monitoring the HTCs on eleven heaters.

Inter-laboratory validation of 4-(dimethylamino) cinnamaldehyde (DMAC) assay using cranberry proanthocyanidin standard for quantification of soluble proanthocyanidins in cranberry foods and dietary supplements, first action official methodSM: 2019.06.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Proanthocyanidins (PAC) are oligomers and polymers of flavan-3-ols with putative health benefits. PAC are prevalent in a wide variety of natural products and dietary supplements. Objective. An inter-laboratory study was conducted to validate the 4-(dimethylamino) cinnamaldehyde (DMAC) colorimetric assay using a 96-well plate spectrophotometer for the accurate quantification of PAC in cranberry products and to evaluate the comparison of the procyanidin A2 (ProA2) dimer and cranberry PAC (c-PAC) reference standards. Methods. Four test materials analyzed in this study included cranberry fiber powder, cranberry extract powder, concentrated cranberry juice, and a solution of cranberry PAC (30%, w/v). The samples were homogenized, extracted, sonicated, centrifuged, and analyzed using a 96-well plate spectrophotometer. Results. Linearity for both the ProA2 and c-PAC standards was determined from 4.053 to 50.666 g/mL and from 13.520 to 135.95 g/mL, respectively. The relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSDr) values for the four materials analyzed, using both ProA2 and c-PAC standards, met the Standard Method Performance Requirements (SMPR). Inter-laboratory precision using Horwitz ratio (HorRat) values for the four materials analyzed, using both ProA2 and c-PAC standards, satisfies the acceptance range in Appendix K of the Official Methods. Of Analysis (2003): Guidelines for Dietary Supplements and Botanicals. The limit of quantification (LOQ) was estimated to be 3.16 g/mL. Conclusions. The results produced from this study demonstrate the utility of the c-PAC standard over the ProA2 standard and the advantages of using a 96-well plate spectrophotometer for the accurate quantification of PAC. Highlights. The use of a 96-well plate reader and c-PAC reference standard in the DMAC method improves accuracy and percision for quantification of soluble proanthocyanidins in cranberry foods and dietary supplements. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Bacterial infection induces mucus overproduction, contributing to acute exacerbations and lung function decline in chronic respiratory diseases. A diet enriched in apples may provide protection from pulmonary disease development and progression. This study examined whether phloretin, an apple polyphenol, inhibits mucus synthesis and secretion induced by the predominant bacteria associated with chronic respiratory diseases. Methods and Results. The expression of mucus constituent mucin 5AC (MUC5AC) in FVB/NJ mice and NCI-H292 epithelial cells is analyzed. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi)-infected mice developed increased MUC5AC mRNA, which a diet containing phloretin inhibited. In NCI-H292 cells, NTHi, Moraxella catarrhalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased MUC5AC mRNA, which phloretin inhibited. Phloretin also diminished NTHi-induced MUC5AC protein secretion. NTHi-induced increased MUC5AC required toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and NADH oxidase 4 (NOX4) signaling and subsequent activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) /mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Phloretin inhibited NTHi-induced TLR4/NOX4 and EGFR/MAPK signaling, thereby preventing increased MUC5AC mRNA. EGFR activation can also result from increased EGFR ligand synthesis and subsequent ligand activation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). In NCI-H292 cells, NTHi increased EGFR ligand and MMP1 and MMP13 mRNA, which phloretin inhibited. Conclusions. In summary, phloretin is a promising therapeutic candidate for preventing bacterial-induced mucus overproduction. © 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbH.		; Di, Yuanpu Peter/H-4191-2016	Bondarchuk, Natalya/0000-0003-2338-7386; Di, Yuanpu Peter/0000-0003-2028-2087							2021	65	2			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202000658					FSTA:2021-05-Je6773
J		Birsan, R. I.; Wilde, P.; Waldron, K. W.; Dilip K. Rai							Anticholinesterase activities of different solvent extracts of brewer's spent grain.		Foods					Cholinesterases, involved in acetylcholine catabolism in the central and peripheral nervous system, have been strongly linked with neurodegenerative diseases. Current therapeutic approaches using synthetic drugs present several side effects. Hence, there is an increasing research interest in naturally-occurring dietary polyphenols, which are also considered efficacious. Food processing by-products such as brewer's spent grain (BSG) would be a potential bio-source of polyphenols. In this study, polyphenol-rich BSG extracts using 60% acetone and 0.75% NaOH solutions were generated, which were further subjected to liquid-liquid partitioning using various organic solvents. The water-partitioned fractions of the saponified extracts had the highest total polyphenol content (6.2 2.8 mgGAE/g dw) as determined by Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, while the LC-MS/MS showed ethyl acetate fraction with the highest phenolics (2.9 0.3 mg/g BSG dw). The best inhibitions of acetyl-(37.9 2.9%) and butyryl-(53.6 7.7%) cholinesterases were shown by the diethyl ether fraction of the saponified extract. This fraction contained the highest sum of quantified phenolics (99 21.2 g/mg of extract), and with significant (p< 0.01) inhibitory contribution of decarboxylated-diferulic acid. Amongst the standards, caffeic acid presented the highest inhibition for both cholinesterases, 25.5 0.2% for acetyl-and 52.3 0.8% for butyryl-cholinesterase, respectively, whilst the blends insignificantly inhibited both cholinesterases. The results showed that polyphenol-rich BSG fractions have potentials as natural anti-cholinesterase agents. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Ambient mass spectrometry as a tool to determine poultry production system history: a comparison of rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) and direct analysis in real time (DART) ambient mass spectrometry platforms.		Food Control					Ambient mass spectrometry is a tool of growing interest for the testing of foodstuffs over the fifteen years since the pioneering techniques of desorption electro-spray ionisation (DESI), direct analysis in real time (DART) and atmospheric pressure solid analysis probe (ASAP) were first demonstrated. In this study, rapid evaporative ionisation mass spectrometry (REIMS) was compared with DART to assess whether either system was capable of correctly identifying poultry raised in one of six distinct production systems. REIMS was able to correctly identify 98%-100% of birds based on their breed. The ability of this platform to identify birds based on their production system ranged from 60% to 100%, depending on the breed and production system involved. Furthermore, it showed 94%-100% accuracy in identifying premium products and shows substantial promise in detecting mislabelling frauds. DART was able to identify 100% of birds based on both breed and production systems, but required extensive sample preparation which impacted throughput, thus DART is a more suitable technique for laboratory based testing as opposed to factory based. This study has shown, for the first time, the capabilities of ambient mass spectrometry as a tool to determine poultry production systems employed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The advancement of mass spectrometry provides advantages for transgenic protein characterization in support of safety assessments of genetically modified crops. Here, we describe how matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization in-source decay (ISD) mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with intact mass and bottom-up analyses can be applied to achieve high confidence in the sequences of transgenic proteins expressed in plants and establish the biochemical equivalence of microbially produced protein surrogates. ISD confirmed 40-60 near terminal residues regardless of the protein size, including the improvement of the coverage of cysteine-rich proteins by the reduction/alkylation of disulfide bonds. Negative ISD significantly improved spectral quality and sequence coverage of acidic proteins. Various post-translational modifications, such as terminal truncations and N-terminal methionine excision and acetylation, were identified in plant-produced proteins by top-down MS. Finally, we demonstrated that a combination of top-down and bottom-up analyses provides high confidence in sequence equivalence of plant and microbially produced proteins.

Analysis of aging type- and aging time-related changes in the polar fraction of metabolome of beef by 1H NMR spectroscopy.		Food Chemistry					The tenderness and taste of beef is improved by either dry-or wet-aging or a combination of both. The objective was to develop a validated method for detecting differences in the polar fraction of metabolome in dry-aged and wet-aged beef over the aging time and quantifying the metabolites of interest by1H NMR spectroscopy using beef. Sixty strip loin (M. Longissimus dorsi) samples aged in different ways (wet-aging vs. dry-aging) and aging times (0, 7, 14, 21, 28 days) were analyzed. The aging type could be defined by linear discriminant analysis with an accuracy of 95%. Ten (lactic acid, alanine, methionine, fumaric acid, inosine, inosine monophosphate, creatine, betaine, carnosine and hypoxanthine) out of eighteen metabolites differ significantly (p < 0.05) in content depending on the aging type. Fifteen metabolites in dry-aged and ten in wet-aged beef correlate with the aging time (r > 0.7, <-0.7), which shows significant aging time-related effects on the polar fraction of metabolome.

Food Research International					Cashew nuts are mainly consumed as a roasted and salted snack. Lately, the industry has gained interest in broken kernels because of their added value. In this study, defatted cashew nut flour (DCF) underwent simulated gastrointestinal digestion to obtain a soluble (CDs) and an insoluble (CDi) digested fraction. These fractions, which resulted from the digestion of a complex matrix, were evaluated for antioxidant capacity of bioaccessible compounds (present on the soluble digested fraction, CDs) and their potential prebiotic effect, considering that the insoluble digested fraction (CDi) could be fermented by the microbiota in the gut. The DCF had a high protein content (40.74%), being nutritionally characterized as a balanced source of amino acids, with a predominance of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and tyrosine), threonine and histidine. The digested DCF presented 76.90% of the soluble components of low molecular weight (0.1-2 kDa), which is typical of antioxidant peptides. The soluble digested fraction (CDs) significantly increased the antioxidant capacity in relation to flour in the ORAC and ABTS assays and the aqueous extract presented the highest values (526.0 and 76.64 as mol Trolox Eq./g sample, respectively). The CDs protected 29.03% of the supercoiled DNA band and ratified the potential antioxidant capacity after GID in a physiological assay. In addition, the insoluble digested fraction showed a potential prebiotic effect for Bifdobacterium lactis BB-12. Finally, simulated gastrointestinal digestion improves the bioaccessibility of CDF antioxidant compounds as a complex matrix, containing low molecular weight peptides and phenolic compounds, which become more available to react with reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, the potential prebiotic effect of defatted cashew nut flour has yielded a promising solution for the total reuse of broken cashew nut kernel as a functional food ingredient.

Effect of intermittent drying on the energy consumption and physiological quality of soybean seeds.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Energy efficiency can be considered as one of the main components of sustainability. This study aimed to explore an alternative to reduce the energy consumption of drying process, besides to preserve the nutritional reserve of soybean seeds by applying intermittent drying. We dried soybean seeds in a fixed bed dryer and compared the conventional and intermittent operation results. Physiological quality of dried seeds was assessed in terms of germination, vigor, and fissure, in addition, the energy consumption of the operation was calculated. Results. Indicate a 46% reduction in energy consumption for intermittent operation in comparison to conventional drying for air temperature of 50 °C and 42% for air temperature of 70 °C. High temperature (70 °C) caused a reduction in germination and vigor of seeds, accelerating deterioration, and compromising soybean quality. Practical applications. Drying is essential to prolong the life of soybeans, reducing the typical postharvest moisture content. However, one of the main disadvantages of this technique is the high-energy consumption and the loss in the nutritional and physical-chemical quality of the final product compared to other methods of drying, especially at high drying temperatures. The global energy crisis and consumption of quality dry foods further challenge the development of innovative food drying techniques to deal with these difficulties. Intermittent drying is considered as one of the promising alternatives to improve energy efficiency and product quality without increasing the cost of the dryer. The results of this study show that the use of intermittent drying is an alternative that significantly contributes to reduce the energy demand of the process and contributes to the quality of dry soybeans in the field. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Dairy Science					The application of an adaptation strategy for probiotics, which may improve their stress tolerance, requires the identification of the growth range for each parameter tested. In this study, 4 probiotics (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lacticaseibacillus casei, Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus, and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum) were grown under different pH, NaCl, and sucrose concentrations at 25°C, 30°C, and 37°C. Turbidimetric growth curves were carried out and lag phase duration, maximum growth rate, and amplitude (i.e., the difference between initial and stationary phase optical density) were estimated. Moreover, cell morphology was observed, and cell length measured. The growth response, as well as the morphological changes, were quite different within the 4 species. The L. acidophilus was the most sensitive strain, whereas L. plantarum was shown to better tolerate a wide range of stressful conditions. Frequently, morphological changes occurred when the growth curve was delayed. Based on the results, ranges of environmental parameters are proposed that can be considered suboptimal for each strain, and therefore could be tested. The quantitative evaluation of the growth kinetics as well as the morphological observation of the cells can constitute useful support to the choice of the parameters to be used in an adaptation strategy, notwithstanding the need to verify the effect on viability both in model systems and in foods.

Purebreeding with sexed semen and crossbreeding with semen from double-muscled sires to improve beef production from dairy herds: live and slaughter performances of crossbred calves.		Journal of Dairy Science					The use of sexed semen to produce purebred replacement heifers allows a large proportion of dairy cows to be mated to beef sires, and quantitative and qualitative improvements to be made to beef production from dairy herds. The major dairy and beef breeds are undergoing rapid genetic improvement as a result of more efficient selection methods, prompting a need to evaluate the meat production of crossbred beef*dairy cattle produced using current genetics. As part of a large project involving 125 commercial dairy farms, we evaluated the combined use of purebreeding with sexed semen and crossbreeding with semen from beef sires, particularly double-muscled breeds. A survey of 1,530 crossbred calves revealed that, whereas purebred dairy calves are destined almost exclusively for veal production, beef*dairy crossbred calves are also destined for beef production after fattening on either the dairy farm of birth or by specialized fatteners. In veal production, compared with Belgian Blue-sired calves (taken as the reference), double-muscled INRA 95-sired calves had a lighter slaughter weight (303 vs. 346 kg), but a greater dressing percent (62.3 vs. 58.4%). Limousin (also known as Limousine)-sired calves had a smaller average daily gain (1.26 vs. 1.34 kg/d), and lighter slaughter (314 vs. 346 kg) and carcass weights (182 vs. 201 kg). Last, Simmental-sired calves had a similar growth rate, but lighter carcass weight (177 vs. 201 kg), smaller dressing percentage (55.3 vs. 58.4%), and smaller muscularity scores (3.25 vs. 3.72). In the case of young bulls and heifers fattened on the dairy farm of birth, Belgian Blue-, Piemontese (also known as Piedmontese)-, and Limousin-sired calves performed similarly; the only exception was that Piemontese-sired calves had a greater dressing percentage. Belgian Blue-and Limousin-sired calves performed similarly when fattened by specialized beef producers. In both veal and beef production, the effects of dam breed were less important than sire breed. Considering the entire project, we can conclude that the combined use of sexed semen for purebreeding and conventional beef semen for terminal crossbreeding improves meat production from dairy herds, especially when the sires are double-muscled beef breeds.

Effects of breed, farm intensiveness, and cow productivity level on cheese-making ability predicted using infrared spectral data at the population level.		Journal of Dairy Science					Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra collected during milk recording schemes at population level can be used for predicting novel traits of interest for farm management, cows' genetic improvement, and milk payment systems. The aims of this study were as follows. (1) To predict cheese yield traits using FTIR spectra from routine milk recordings exploiting previously developed calibration equations. (2) To compare the predicted cheese-making abilities of different dairy and dual-purpose breeds. (3) To analyze the effects of herds' level of intensiveness (HL) and of the cow's level of productivity (CL). (4) To compare the patterns of predicted cheese yields with the patterns of milk composition in different breeds to discern the drivers of cheese-making efficiency. The major sources of variation of FTIR predictions of cheese yield ability (fresh cheese or cheese solids produced per unit milk) of individual milk samples were studied on 115,819 cows of 4 breeds (2 specialized dairy breeds, Holstein and Brown Swiss, and 2 dual-purpose breeds, Simmental and Alpine Grey) from 6,430 herds and exploiting 1,759,706 FTIR test-day spectra collected over 7 yr of milk sampling. Calibration equations used were previously developed on 1,264 individual laboratory model cheese procedures (cross-validation R2 0.85 and 0.95 for fresh and solids cheese yields, respectively). The linear model used for statistical analysis included the effects of parity, lactation stage, year of calving, month of sampling, HL, CL, breed of cow, and the interactions breed * HL and breed * CL. The HL and CL stratifications (5 classes each) were based on average daily secretion of milk net energy per cow. All effects were highly significant. The major conclusions were as follows. (1) The FTIR-based prediction of cheese yield of milk goes beyond the knowledge of fat and protein content, partially explaining differences in cheese-making ability in different cows, breeds and herds. (2) Differences in cheese yields of different breeds are only partially explained by milk fat and protein composition, and less productive breeds are characterized by a higher milk nutrient content as well as a higher recovery of nutrients in the cheese. (3) High-intensive herds not only produce much more milk, but the milk has a higher nutrient content and a higher cheese yield, whereas within herds, compared with less productive cows, the more productive cows have a much greater milk yield, milk with a greater content of fat but not of protein, and a moderate improvement in cheese yield, differing little from expectations based on milk composition. Finally, (4) the effects of HL and CL on milk quality and cheese-making ability are similar but not identical in different breeds, the less productive ones having some advantage in terms of cheese-making ability. We can obtain FTIR-based prediction of cheese yield from individual milk samples retrospectively at population level, which seems to go beyond the simple knowledge of milk composition, incorporating information on nutrient retention ability in cheese, with possible advantages for management of farms, genetic improvement of dairy cows, and milk payment systems.

J		Bixia Fu; Gezhi Xiao; Yang Zhang; Jifeng Yuan							One-pot bioconversion of lignin-derived substrates into gallic acid.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Lignin is regarded as the most abundant renewable aromatic compound on earth. In this study, we established Escherichia coli-based whole-cell biocatalytic systems to efficiently convert two lignin-derived substrates (ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid) to gallic acid. For the synthesis of gallic acid from ferulic acid, we used the recombinant E. coli expressing feruloyl-CoA synthetase and enoyl-CoA hydratase/aldolase from Pseudomonas putida, aldehyde dehydrogenase (HFD1) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, vanillic acid O-demethylase (VanAB) from P. putida, and a mutant version of p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase (PobAY385F) from P. putida. Under the fed-batch mode, 19.57 mM gallic acid was obtained from 20 mM ferulic acid with a conversion rate of 97.9%. To achieve gallic acid synthesis from p-coumaric acid, we replaced VanAB with the two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenase (HpaBC) from E. coli. Under optimal conditions, 20 mM p-coumaric acid afforded the production of 19.96 mM gallic acid with near 100% conversion. To the best of our knowledge, our work represented the first study to develop E. coli-based whole-cell biocatalysts for the eco-friendly synthesis of gallic acid from lignin-derived renewable feedstocks.										2021	69	38	11336	11341	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03960					FSTA:2022-02-Bi0177

Food & Function					Increasing evidence has shown that the gut microbiota plays an important role in preventing obesity; however, the mechanism by which insoluble dietary fiber (IDF) prevents high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of SIDF on obesity in HFD mice and determine the mechanism by which it prevents obesity through regulating the gut microbiota. Soybean insoluble dietary fiber (SIDF) was used as an intervention in HFD mice for 20 weeks. The results showed that SIDF significantly reduced the body weight (BW), fat index, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol while increasing the content of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in HFD mice. SIDF intervention was also beneficial for the reduction of liver lipid content and fatty droplets in mice. Furthermore, SIDF intervention improved the gut microbiota composition by increasing the relative abundance of potentially beneficial bacteria (such as Lactobacillales [order], Lactobacillus [genus], Lachnospirace_Nk4A136_group [genus]), and reduced the relative abundance of potentially harmful bacteria (such as Lachnospiraceae [family] and Bacteroides_acidifaciens [species]), which correlated with obesity (at least p< 0.05 in all instances). Finally, SIDF was fermented by related beneficial bacteria, which increased the content of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), and promoted the secretion of satiety hormones. In conclusion, SIDF intervention could prevent obesity in HFD mice by modulating the gut microbiota composition. Hence, SIDF may be used as a potential ingredient in functional foods. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	17	7923	7937	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00078k					FSTA:2021-12-Jn16938

European Food Research and Technology					Jinmudan (JM) tea, produced using Camellia sinensis, cultivar JM, is popular among consumers because of its strong floral and fruity aroma. Aroma profiles of white, green, black, and oolong teas, which were obtained from JM and Tanyangcaicha (TY, control and indigenous variety), were investigated. Sensory evaluation was used to describe the quality characteristics of the tea samples. A combination of headspace solid-phase microextraction, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS), and chemometrics was used to extract and analyze the volatiles in the samples; 162 volatiles were identified and categorized on the basis of their chemical structures. The proportions of chemical categories differed among the teas. The same type of tea obtained from JM and TY differed significantly in concentrations and categories of volatiles. This study will improve our understanding of the profile of volatile compounds in JM teas and create a basis for investigating the biological characteristics of JM teas. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	5	1061	1082	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03687-0					FSTA:2021-08-Hn7816
J		Black, K.; Daute, M.; Tziboula-Clarke, A.; White, P. J.; Iannetta, P. P. M.; Walker, G.							Utilization of low nitrogen barley for production of distilling quality malt.		Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists					The potential to utilize low nitrogen barley for production of distilling quality malt was studied. This presents an opportunity to reduce the environmental impact of nitrogen fertilizer applications. Malting barley (cv. Octavia) was grown without the application of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer, to produce grain with a relatively low nitrogen concentration (1.16%, dry weight basis). Following micro-malting trials, dextrinizing units (58 DU) obtained from low nitrogen malt were much higher than a typical specification of 45 DU for malt with a conventional nitrogen concentration (<1.5%). A higher soluble nitrogen ratio (SNR) or index of modification (IoM) of 49 indicated greater modification of the low nitrogen barley, resulting in higher extract released into the wort. Additionally, much lower levels of beta-glucan were found in low nitrogen malt wort (64mg/L compared with over 100mg/L in wort of conventional nitrogen malt). Low nitrogen malt also produced higher predicted spirit yields following wort fermentation and wash distillation. These findings indicate that lower nitrogen concentration barley can be processed without negatively impacting malt quality for distilling applications. The implication of these findings to help realize more environmentally sustainable production of barley for malting and use in distilling is discussed. © 2020 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.										2021	79	1	26	32	0361-0470				10.1080/03610470.2020.1796090					FSTA:2021-04-Hc4559
J		Blackmore, H.; Hidrio, C.; Yeomans, M. R.							A taste of things to come: the effect of extrinsic and intrinsic cues on perceived properties of beer mediated by expectations.		Food Quality and Preference					Before consuming a food or beverage, consumers are exposed to many sources of information related to the product. Such product-related cues can generate expectations, some of which can improve consumers' sensory perception and liking of the product. The question posed in the current study is whether labelling and colour of beer can be used to modify consumers' expectations and improve perception of its taste, flavour and mouthfeel, as these properties can be problematic in reduced alcohol beers. The aim of the current study was to explore how the most salient extrinsic and intrinsic cues affect expectations and perception in the context of beer. Using a repeated measures design, 72 participants viewed label-based sensory information and tasted 16 beer samples differing in colour and bitterness. Participants rated expected and perceived liking, bitterness, refreshment, and body. As predicted, both sensory descriptor and beer colour generated sensory and hedonic expectations. We have also demonstrated that expectations mediate the effect of product related cues on perception and liking. Beer colour affected perceived liking, bitterness, refreshment, and body both directly and indirectly, yet the sensory descriptor "bitter" only affected sensory perception and liking indirectly. Overall, we conclude that extrinsic and intrinsic cues can together change expectations and more importantly perception and thus potentially compensate for the perceived deficits in taste, flavour and mouthfeel commonly found in reduced alcohol beers.

The effects of thermal pasteurisation, freeze-drying, and gamma-irradiation on the antibacterial properties of donor human milk.		Foods					The most common pasteurisation method used by human milk banks is Holder pasteurisation. This involves thermal processing, which can denature important proteins and can potentially reduce the natural antimicrobial properties found in human milk. This study assesses the application of a hybrid method comprised of freeze-drying followed by low-dose gamma-irradiation for nonthermal donor human milk pasteurisation. Freeze-drying donor human milk followed by gamma-irradiation at 2 kGy was as efficient as Holder pasteurisation in the reduction of bacterial inoculants of Staphylococcus aureus (106 cfu/mL) and Salmonella typhimurium (106 cfu/mL) in growth inhibition assays. These assays also demonstrated that human milk naturally inhibits the growth of bacterial inoculants S. aureus, S. Typhimurium, and Escherichia coli. Freeze drying (without gamma-irradiation) did not significantly reduce this natural growth inhibition. By contrast, Holder pasteurisation significantly reduced the milk's natural antimicrobial effect on S. aureus growth after 6 h (-19.8% p=0.01). Freeze-dried and then gamma-irradiated donor human milk showed a strong antimicrobial effect across a dose range of 2-50 kGy, with only a minimal growth of S. aureus observed after 6 h incubation. Thus, a hybrid method of freeze-drying followed by 2 kGy of gamma-irradiation preserves antimicrobial properties and enables bulk pasteurisation within sealed packaging of powderised donor human milk. This work forwards a goal of increasing shelf life and simplifying storage and transportation, while also preserving functionality and antimicrobial properties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Blahovec, J.; Kourim, P.; Lebovka, N.							Volumetric shrinkage and Poisson's ratio of carrot treated by pulse electric fields.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Typically, the carrot tissues have rather high initial moisture content and low porosity. Expression of juice from such tissue may be rather complicated and include different stages. In this work, a simple creep tests with carrot tissue treated by pulsed electric fields (PEF) were performed. The samples were compressed for 15 min in a special jig using a constant load of F = 0.5 kg (initial pressure p = 1.89 bar) or 1 kg (initial pressure p = 3.78 bar). PEF treatment was done using electric field strength E = 0,483,838, and 1037 V/cm and pulse duration of ti = 10 ms to different levels of tissue disintegration Z. Effect of PEF on volumetric shrinkage V* and Poisson's ratio mu of have been evaluated for the first time. Different stages were observed for time behavior of V* and mu. From time evolution of V* presence of the primary (initial) and final (secondary) creep relaxation processes was suggested. It was demonstrated that the damage of cells induced by PEF resulted in redistribution between contributions of primary and secondary stages. The time evolutions of Poisson ratio's was described by first order kinetic equation. It was shown that PEF treatment decreased the value of Poisson ratio's. Significant effects of PEF treatment on volumetric shrinkage and Poisson 's ratio were not accompanied with large changes in moisture content inside the carrot tissues. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

International Dairy Journal					Conciato Romano is believed to be the oldest Italian ewe cheese; it is manufactured according to an unusual technology, ending with a long ripening in earthenware jars. Cheese was monitored during production and ripening in two different seasons: winter and spring. According to the data obtained, the ripening in jars prevents lipid oxidation, and ensures the safety of the product. Coagulase-positive staphylococci, Salmonella and Listeria spp. Were never retrieved, while Enterobacteriaceae and Escherichia coli disappeared during the ripening, likely due to the antimicrobial activity of the tanning of the cheeses. Mesophilic lactic acid bacteria dominated the entire production process, with Lactiplantibacillus plantarum subsp. Plantarum and enterococci accounting for about 26% and 30%, respectively, of the total cultures isolated (203). Total monounsaturated fatty acids and omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were higher in cheeses produced during spring, while the atherogenic index was significantly lower. Outcomes of texture analysis confirmed seasonal differences, stressing the role of the animals' feeding regimen. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Blanch, G.; Castillo, M. R. del							Effect of baking temperature on the phenolic content and antioxidant activity of black corn  (Zea mays L.) bread.		Foods					Black corn is known for its health-promoting properties, which are due to its high content of bioactive phytonutrients. However, the high temperatures required during the processing of bakery products usually trigger thermal degradation, and therefore, the loss of all labile bioactive compounds. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of baking temperature on the phenolic content (i.e., TPC, TAC and individual phenolics) and antioxidant activity in black corn (Millo corvo variety) bread. As a result, baking always resulted in a general decrease in TPC, even at 150°C. In contrast, TAC only decreased when temperatures as high as 180°C were applied. Some relevant individual phenolics were preserved during the whole process as long as 150°C was used. In particular, the content of the major anthocyanin, namely, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, hardly decreased from the raw flour to the final bread. The loss of antioxidant activity of Millo corvo raw flour during bread baking was avoided by heating at 150°C. These results demonstrate the appropriate temperature to bake Millo corvo corn bread without losing the antioxidant characteristics and health-promoting properties of the starting black corn. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Blanco, A. E. C.; Kerl, C. F.; Planer-Friedrich, B.							Detection of thioarsenates in rice grains and rice products.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Inorganic and methylated thioarsenates have recently been reported to contribute substantially to arsenic (As) speciation in paddy-soil pore waters. Here, we show that thioarsenates can also accumulate in rice grains and rice products. For their detection, a method was developed using a pepsin-pancreatin enzymatic extraction followed by chromatographic separation at pH 13. From 54 analyzed commercial samples, including white, parboiled and husked rice, puffed rice cakes, and rice flakes, 50 contained dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA) (maximum 25.6 mug kg-1), 18 monothioarsenate (MTA) (maximum 5.6 mug kg-1), 14 dimethyldithioarsenate (DMDTA) (maximum 2.8 mug kg-1), and 5 dithioarsenate (DTA) (maximum 2.3 mug kg-1). Additionally, we show that the commonly used nitric acid extraction transforms MTA to arsenite and DMMTA and DMDTA to dimethylarsenate (DMA). Current food guidelines do not require an analysis of thioarsenates in rice and only limit the contents of inorganic oxyarsenic species (including acid-extraction-transformed MTA), but not DMA (including acid-extraction-transformed DMMTA and DMDTA).										2021	69	7	2287	2294	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06853					FSTA:2021-07-Me3802

In this work, the main characteristics of the uptake mechanism have been studied by incubation of digestive gland thin slices in media with different composition and DA concentration. DA uptake seems to follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with a very high estimated KM (1722 g DA mL-1) and a Vmax of 71.9 g DA g-1 h-1, which is similar to those found for other amino acids in invertebrates. Replacement of NaCl from the incubation media by Cl-choline (Na+-free medium) did not significantly reduce the uptake, but replacement by sorbitol (Na+-free and Cl--depleted medium) did. A new experiment replacing all chlorides with their equivalent gluconates (Na+-and Cl--free medium) showed an important reduction in the uptake that should be attributed to the absence of chloride, pointing to a Na+-independent, Cl- (or anion-) dependent transporter. In media with Na+ and Cl-, neither decreasing the pH nor adding cyanide (a metabolic inhibitor) had significant effect on DA uptake, suggesting that the transport mechanism is not H+-or ATP-dependent. In a chloride depleted medium, lowering pH or adding CN increased the uptake, suggesting that other anions could, at least partially, substitute chloride. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Blanco-Fernandez, C.; Garcia-Vazquez, E.; Machado-Schiaffino, G.							Seventeen years analysing mislabelling from DNA barcodes: towards hake sustainability.		Food Control					Mislabelling is a common threat to fisheries sustainability. Over the last decades, molecular tools have been established as the main resource to detect mislabelling. This study focuses on these efforts in the genus Merluccius. A meta-analysis approach is taken in order to detect trends on mislabelling directions for the last 17 years. A total of 1291 DNA-identified hake products from 45 different studies were compiled. An increase in number of publications using DNA forensics to detect mislabelling in hake can be seen along the studied time period. However, representation of different hake species varies, i.e. Pacific hakes are underrepresented. Different risk of mislabelling has been identified depending on the regions: Highest risk of mislabelling was found in African hake species (only 20.53% of African hake were correctly labelled). Furthermore, a high amount of hake products with incomplete labels (e.g. not reporting the species) were unevenly distributed. Directionality in mislabelling was detected for all cases between sympatric species. Differences in mislabelling rates were found for different regions (Africa, Europe, Pacific America and South America). While a decrease in mislabelling was reported between 2011 and 2014, this has not being sustained over time, as more recent data show an increase in mislabelling rates. Altogether, rigorous monitoring of product authenticity is called for, with special attention to the more vulnerable species. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Combination of synergic enzymes and ultrasounds as an effective pretreatment process to break microalgal cell wall and enhance algal oil extraction.		Foods					Microalgal biomass is a sustainable source of bioactive lipids with omega-3 fatty acids. The efficient extraction of neutral and polar lipids from microalgae requires alternative extraction methods, frequently combined with biomass pretreatment. In this work, a combined ultrasound and enzymatic process using commercial enzymes Viscozyme, Celluclast, and Alcalase was optimized as a pretreatment method for Nannochloropsis gaditana, where the Folch method was used for lipid extraction. Significant differences were observed among the used enzymatic pretreatments, combined with ultrasound bath or probe-type sonication. To further optimize this method, ranges of temperatures (35, 45, and 55 °C) and pH (4, 5, and 8) were tested, and enzymes were combined at the best conditions. Subsequently, simultaneous use of three hydrolytic enzymes rendered oil yields of nearly 29%, showing a synergic effect. To compare enzymatic pretreatments, neutral and polar lipids distribution of Nannochloropsis was determined by HPLC-ELSD. The highest polar lipids content was achieved employing ultrasound-assisted enzymatic pretreatment (55 °C and 6 h), whereas the highest glycolipid (44.54%) and PE (2.91%) contents were achieved using Viscozyme versus other enzymes. The method was applied to other microalgae showing the potential of the optimized process as a practical alternative to produce valuable lipids for nutraceutical applications. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Blanco-Morales, V.; Garcia-Llatas, G.; Yebra, M. J.; Sentandreu, V.; Alegria, A.							In vitro colonic fermentation of a plant sterol-enriched beverage in a dynamic-colonic gastrointestinal digester.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The impact of a plant sterol-enriched beverage on the sterol metabolism, organic acid production and microbiota composition was evaluated by means of a dynamic gastrointestinal and colonic fermentation model. After one week of fermentation, an absence of sterol metabolites was reported, in accordance with the lack of microbiota related to their metabolism. Although total organic acid content was lower in the ascending colon (AC) compared to the transversal (TC) and descending colon (DC) (28-57 mmol/L vs. 55-87 and 44-64 mmol/L, respectively), its increments, with respect to the initial value, were higher (2-fold vs. 1.6-and 1.5-fold). Increments of acetate, butyrate and propionate were observed in all colon vessels, whereas lactate production was only observed in the AC at the first hours of fermentation. Results. Showed a progressive increase in microbial species richness and evenness from the AC to the DC. Beverage fermentation also modulated certain members of the microbiota: Bifidobacterium (within 24 h) and Megasphaera genera were stimulated, and Mitsuokella was reduced in AC, while the growth of Klebsiella genus was promoted and Bacteroidetes phylum decreased in TC and DC. These results show that the beverage modulates the microbial community and activity, which could be physiologically relevant to the host.

Migration of photoinitiators, phthalates and plasticizers from paper and cardboard materials into different simulants and foodstuffs.		Food Chemistry					The migration of photoinitiators, phthalates and plasticizers from two paper and cardboard materials into food simulants (50% and 95% EtOH and Tenax) and foodstuffs (rice, cereals and milk powder) was studied. In the case of liquid simulants migration was observed to reach the equilibrium after 60 min and depended on the material type and the physicochemical parameters of the migrants, whereas the temperature (room temperature and 60 °C) did not show significant effects. The study of migration of the compounds from a baking paper to Tenax at high temperatures (150 and 250 °C) evidenced an increment of migration when increasing temperature, except for the most volatile analytes. Finally, the migration to foodstuffs was studied using fully validated analytical protocols. Overall, the comparison of the migration rates demonstrated that Tenax was adequate for the simulation of the migration to rice and cereals, but underestimated the migration to infant milk powder, for which 95% EtOH resulted a more suitable simulant.

J		Bland, J. M.; Grimm, C. C.; Bechtel, P. J.; Uttam Deb; Madan M. Dey							Proximate composition and nutritional attributes of ready-to-cook catfish products.		Foods					To increase the demand for U.S. farm-raised catfish, five healthy, convenient ready-to-cook products were developed to expand consumers' options beyond basic fresh or frozen fillets. Five new catfish products were produced, consisting of one hundred samples of each, including three size-types of Panko-breaded fish products (strips, center cuts of regular fillets, and center cuts from Delacata fillets) and two marinated products (sriracha and sesame-ginger). The breaded products were to be prepared by baking for convenience over traditional frying methods, while the marinated products were to be microwaved as healthy and convenient products. The nutrient content of the samples was analyzed, including protein, moisture, fat, fiber, ash, and carbohydrate, as well as minerals, amino acid, and fatty acid constituent content, with associated atherogenic index (AI) and thrombogenic index (TI), showing unique differences between the Panko-breaded and marinated products. In addition, a trend was observed showing an increase in moisture, protein, ash, and carbohydrate percentages, and a decrease in lipid content related to the volume-to-surface-area ratio, having the order of strips < standard fillets < Delacata fillets. © 2021 by the authors.

Application of whole genome sequencing to understand diversity and presence of genes associated with sanitizer tolerance in Listeria monocytogenes from produce handling sources.		Foods					Recent listeriosis outbreaks linked to fresh produce suggest the need to better understand and mitigate L. monocytogenes contamination in packing and processing environments. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and phenotype screening assays for sanitizer tolerance, we characterized 48 L. monocytogenes isolates previously recovered from environmental samples in five produce handling facilities. Within the studied population there were 10 sequence types (STs) and 16 cgMLST types (CTs). Pairwise single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ranged from 0 to 3047 SNPs within a CT, revealing closely and distantly related isolates indicative of both sporadic and continuous contamination events within the facility. Within Facility 1, we identified a closely related cluster (0-2 SNPs) of isolates belonging to clonal complex 37 (CC37; CT9492), with isolates recovered during sampling events 1-year apart and in various locations inside and outside the facility. The accessory genome of these CC37 isolates varied from 94 to 210 genes. Notable genetic elements and mutations amongst the isolates included the bcrABC cassette (2/48), associated with QAC tolerance; mutations in the actA gene on the Listeria pathogenicity island (LIPI) 1 (20/48); presence of LIPI-3 (21/48) and LIPI-4 (23/48). This work highlights the potential use of WGS in tracing the pathogen within a facility and understanding properties of L. monocytogenes in produce settings. © 2021 by the authors.

The effect of emulsifier by-products and storage conditions on the techno-functional properties of model aerosol whipping cream.		International Dairy Journal					Model aerosol whipping cream (AWC) with a medium-chain saturated monoacylglyceride (me-sMAG) emulsifier and different emulsifier by-products was stored either at 20 °C, 30 °C, or with a temperature profile for 16 weeks (w). Techno-functional properties were analysed and the MAG content was determined by high-performance thin-layer chromatography with fluorescence detection during the storage time. After 8 w, the MAG content of the me-sMAG emulsifier in the product decreased by about 20%, independent of the applied emulsifier by-products and storage temperatures. No effect of the emulsifier by-products on the techno-functional properties of model AWC was found. Although storage at 20 °C had no effect on the techno-functional properties, storage at 30 °C and at the applied temperature profile led to emulsion instabilities with ongoing storage. At 30 °C and short storage times, the foam stability of the model AWC increased, while the foaming capacity decreased and emulsion destabilisation was not observed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Importance of oral phase in in vitro starch digestibility related to wholegrain versus refined pastas and mastication impairment.		Food Hydrocolloids					Starch represents the main source of carbohydrates in human diet and its digestibility is suspected to be involved in the control of glycemic response. The low glycemic index caused by pastas is mainly attributed to the starch-protein network constituting their compact structure. A significant part of the physico-chemical digestive process probably occurs during mastication with exposure to amylase. However, the respective accountability of oral and intestinal phases in digestion is not clearly established, and this knowledge would especially benefit to health management of people suffering of impaired mastication. Food boluses were produced for in vitro gastrointestinal digestion either by in vitro normal (NM) or deficient mastication (DM) of wholegrain and refined pastas. Boluses were first characterized for physical properties. Many large particles were obtained in DM boluses whatever the pastas. Starch and hydrolysis products were then determined in boluses and gastrointestinal digestas. The beginning of starch hydrolysis was confirmed in the mouth with a production of maltose in the NM boluses, around 1.6 g/100g of cooked pastas, significantly decreased to 1.2 g/100g in the DM boluses, whatever the pastas. Even if the negative effect of DM on gastrointestinal starch hydrolysis into glucose was observed for both pastas, the greatest impact occurred in refined ones with 55.90.82 g glucose/100g pastas after NM versus 53.000.95 g/100g after DM. This study highlighted the importance to consider the oral phase in digestion studies, regarding the impact of food structure and oral disruption, and especially in case of DM.

The impact of high-pressure processing on the polyphenol profile and anti-glycaemic, anti-hypertensive and anti-cholinergic activities of extracts obtained from kiwiberry (Actinidia arguta) fruits.		Food Chemistry					This study analysed the impact of high pressure processing (HHP) on the inhibitory effects (IC50) of kiwiberries (cv. "Weiki"), on the formation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and the activity of angiotenisn-converting enzyme (ACE) and the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The polyphenol profile (HPLC-MS/MS) and antioxidant capacity (PCLACW, ABTS, FRAP) were also studied. HHP-treated "Weiki" (450 MPa/5 min and 650 MPa/5 min) was the most potent inhibitor of AGEs in the BSA-GLU model (6.52 mg/mL on average) relative to other materials (12.09-7.21 mg/mL). Among all samples assayed in the BSA-MGO model (61.97-14.48 mg/mL), HHP-treated "Weiki" (450 MPa/5 min) showed the highest anti-AGE activity (12.37 mg/mL). Pressurization (450 MPa/5 min) significantly enhanced the anti-ACE (14.09 mg/mL) and anti-AChE (16.95 mg/mL) potentials of the tested extract relative to the other materials (23.75-14.50 mg/mL and 37.88-19.69 mg/mL, respectively). Pressurization increased polyphenol content and antioxidant capacity of the samples analysed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Use of food additive titanium dioxide (E171) before the introduction of regulatory restrictions due to concern for genotoxicity.		Foods					Food-grade titanium dioxide (TiO2; E171) is a coloring food additive. In May 2021, a scientific opinion was published by the European Food Safety Authority concluding that TiO2 can no longer be considered as a safe food additive. Our aim was to investigate the trends in the use of TiO2 in the food supply. A case study was conducted in Slovenia using two nationally representative cross-sectional datasets of branded foods. Analysis was performed on N=12,644 foods (6012 and 6632 in 2017 and 2020, respectively) from 15 food subcategories where TiO2 was found as a food additive. A significant decrease was observed in the use of TiO2 (3.6% vs. 1.8%; p< 0.01). TiO2 was most often used in the chewing gum category (36.3%) in 2017, and chocolate and sweets category (45.9%) in 2020. Meanwhile, in 2017, the largest share of TiO2-containing foods was observed in the chewing gum category, namely, 70.3%, and these products presented over 85% of the market share. In 2020, only 24.6% of chewing gums contained TiO2, which accounted for only 3% of the market share. In conclusion, we showed an overall decrease in TiO2 use, even though it has not yet been officially removed from the list of authorized food additives. © 2021 by the authors.

Spectroscopic discrimination of bee pollen by composition, color, and botanical origin.		Foods					Bee pollen samples were discriminated using vibrational spectroscopic methods by connecting with botanical sources, composition, and color. SEM and light microscope images of bee pollen loads were obtained and used to assess the botanical origin. Fourier transform (FT) mid-and near-infrared (FT-MIR, FT-NIR), and FT-Raman spectra of bee pollen samples (a set of randomly chosen loads can be defined as an independent sample) were measured and processed by principal component analysis (PCA). The CIE L*a*b* color space parameters were calculated from the image analysis. FT-MIR, FT-NIR, and FT-Raman spectra showed marked sensitivity to bee pollen composition. In addition, FT-Raman spectra indicated plant pigments as chemical markers of botanical origin. Furthermore, the fractionation of bee pollen was also performed, and composition of the fractions was characterized as well. The combination of imaging, spectroscopic, and statistical methods is a potent tool for bee pollen discrimination and thus may evaluate the quality and composition of this bee-keeping product. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					A bottom-up approach identifying equivalent effects of high-pressure processing (HPP-600 MPa, 20°C, 10min), thermal treatment (TT-70°C, 15 min) and high pressure-mild thermal processing (HPMT-600 MPa, 50°C, 10 min) on quality and stability of peach-strawberry puree was applied during refrigerated storage. TT and HPP ensured 3-log aerobic bacteria inactivation at first, while HPMT reduction was below the detection limit. After 21 days all samples had equivalent microbiological stability. A 2.6-fold increase in the residual activity of PPO and POD was found in the HPP sample compared to TT and HPMT samples (1st day); after 21 days PPO, POD and TPC were equivalent for TT and HPP peach-strawberry purees. Equivalent volatile profile and rheology behavior was observed after 21 days of all samples' storage. Meanwhile, the color of the HPP, TT and HMPT samples remained significantly different (p< 0.05) throughout the whole storage period, with the lowest browning index registered for HPP samples. © 2021 by the authors.

Saccharina latissima cultivated in northern Norway: reduction of potentially toxic elements during processing in relation to cultivation depth.		Foods					There is an increasing interest in the use of Saccharina latissima (sugar kelp) as food, but the high iodine content in raw sugar kelp limits the daily recommended intake to relatively low levels. Processing strategies for iodine reduction are therefore needed. Boiling may reduce the iodine content effectively, but not predictably, since reductions from 38-94% have been reported. Thus, more information on which factors affect the reduction of iodine are needed. In this paper, sugar kelp cultivated at different depths were rinsed and boiled, to assess the effect of cultivation depth on the removal efficacy of potentially toxic elements (PTEs), especially iodine, cadmium, and arsenic, during processing. Raw kelp cultivated at 9 m contained significantly more iodine than kelp cultivated at 1 m, but the difference disappeared after processing. Furthermore, the content of cadmium and arsenic was not significantly affected by cultivation depth. The average reduction during rinsing and boiling was 85% for iodine and 43% for arsenic, but no significant amount of cadmium, lead, or mercury was removed. Cultivation depths determined the relative effect of processing on the iodine content, with a higher reduction for kelp cultivated at 9 m (87%) compared to 1 m (82%). When not taken into consideration, cultivation depth could mask small reductions in iodine content during rinsing or washing. Furthermore, since the final content of PTEs was not dependent on the cultivation depth, the type and extent of processing determines whether cultivation depth should be considered as a factor in cultivation infrastructure design and implementation, or alternatively, in product segmentation. © 2021 by the authors.

Seaweed products for the future: using current tools to develop a sustainable food industry.		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. Although commonly consumed in Asia, seaweeds are a largely underutilized food source in the Western world. However, interest is rising, and seaweeds have a major potential as both main and functional ingredients in European markets. The current barriers for seaweeds as food products relate to food safety, quality preservation and optimization, and food neophobia. Scope and approach. This commentary provides an overview of current challenges to providing seaweed in the European market and proposed solutions to tackle these obstacles, taking inspiration from other food sectors. Processing and packaging concepts for future manufacturing of seaweeds as food are explored and insight into market research and strategies for overcoming the barrier of consumer skepticism are given. Key findings and conclusions. Tackling safety issues related to human consumption of seaweeds is required for their widespread use in food applications. Sustainable, multi-target mitigation strategies towards microbiological and chemical (excessive iodine, heavy metals, allergens) hazards are driving the improvement of food safety of seaweeds and derived products. Rapid post-harvest deterioration of seaweeds can be avoided through stabilization techniques, for instance through temporary storage solutions before final processing, direct utilization into food items, and packaging. Innovative drying and alternative processing strategies may reduce energy consumption and processing time, while at the same time improving the safety as well as the nutritional and sensory qualities of the product. Despite the rising popularity of Asian cuisine and the Western-consumers' perception of seaweeds as a "healthy superfood", understanding consumer behavior in relation to new foods and facilitating information-based decisions could reduce potential consumer skepticism. In conclusion, innovation tools discussed in this work can be exploited for further development of a sustainable seaweed food industry.

Comparing rheological, tribological and sensory properties of microfibrillated cellulose dispersions and xanthan gum solutions.		Food Hydrocolloids					Utilisation of plant waste materials contributes to sustainable food production and allows preparation of functional ingredients from natural bio-materials. Microfibrillated cellulose (MFC) from plant waste materials such as citrus peels has been suggested to have potential as "clean label" thickener. This study compared rheological (shear and extensional rheology, hysteresis, yield stress), tribological and sensory properties of MFC dispersions (0.2-2.0 wt%) to xanthan gum (XG) solutions (0.04-4.3 wt%) and linked sensory characteristics to instrumental properties. Concentrations of MFC and XG were chosen so that shear viscosities of MFC dispersions and XG solutions were similar over a large range of shear rates. XG had higher extensional viscosity at high deformation rates than MFC. XG had higher yield stress than MFC at similar shear viscosity. Yield stress increased linearly with increasing concentrations for XG, while it increased exponentially for MFC. Seventy-three consumers evaluated the appearance, flavour, and mouthfeel of all samples using the Rate-All-That-Apply (RATA) method. Sensory differences between MFC and XG were generally larger at higher concentrations. MFC dispersions were less transparent and had more intense cardboard flavour than XG solutions of comparable shear viscosity. At high thickener concentrations, XG solutions were perceived as glossier, stickier, slimier and more mouthcoating than MFC dispersions of similar shear viscosity. Sticky, slimy and mouthcoating perception were correlated with extensional viscosity at higher deformation rates. We conclude that MFC can thicken foods similar to XG while avoiding undesired texture sensations such as mouthcoating, sliminess and stickiness. The flavour and dispersibility of MFC need to be improved further before it can be applied as thickener in foods. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Blondin-Brosseau, M.; Harlow, J.; Doctor, T.; Nasheri, N.							Examining the persistence of human Coronavirus 229E on fresh produce.		Food Microbiology					Human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are mainly associated with respiratory infections. However, there is evidence that highly pathogenic HCoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), infect the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and are shed in the fecal matter of the infected individuals. These observations have raised questions regarding the possibility of fecal-oral route as well as foodborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV. Studies regarding the survival of HCoVs on inanimate surfaces demonstrate that these viruses can remain infectious for hours to days, however, there is limited data regarding the viral survival on fresh produce, which is usually consumed raw or with minimal heat processing. To address this knowledge gap, we examined the persistence of HCoV-229E, as a surrogate for highly pathogenic HCoVs, on the surface of commonly consumed fresh produce, including: apples, tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce. Herein, we demonstrated that viral infectivity declines within a few hours post-inoculation (p. I) on apples and tomatoes, and no infectious virus was detected at 24h p. I, while the virus persists in infectious form for 72h p.i on cucumbers and lettuce. The stability of viral RNA was examined by droplet-digital RT-PCR (ddRT-PCR), and it was observed that there is no considerable reduction in viral RNA within 72h p.i. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					The present study illustrated modulation of protein aggregation by affecting disulfide/sulfhydryl exchange reactions by adding different concentrations of free thiol represented by reduced-glutathione (GSH) for modulating myofibrillar protein (MP) gel properties at 75°C or 95°C. Gel strength and rheological results showed the effects of GSH were dependent on the concentrations (5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 g/kg) and heating temperatures. SEM results showed that the addition of GSH improved the gel microstructure at 95°C. AFM and DLS results indicated that protein aggregation was also inhibited. At 75°C, the addition of GSH influenced both MP aggregation and gel properties. Low concentrations (5, 10 g/kg) of GSH promoted aggregation, whereas high concentrations (20, 40, and 80 g/kg) of GSH inhibited this. By analyzing the protein structure and cross-linking pattern changes of MP and MP/GSH composites, a pathway involving GSH influencing MP gel properties was determined.

J		Bo Chen; Jie Guo; Yong Xie; Kai Zhou; Peijun Li; Baocai Xu							Modulating the aggregation of myofibrillar protein to alleviate the textural deterioration of protein gels at high temperature: the effect of hydrophobic interactions.		Food Chemistry					In this study, the strategy of utilizing a model hydrophobic molecule, octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA), to inhibit over-aggregation of MP during heating, aiming to alleviate high temperature-induced textural deterioration of MP gels, was proposed, and a series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness. The results showed that the effect was positively dependent on the concentrations of OSA. The addition of OSA at a concentration of 4 g/kg to 24 g/kg delayed the gelation temperature of MP, as confirmed by the DSC results, and inhibited the aggregation of MP through hydrophobic interactions between OSA and MP, as revealed by fluorescence and FTIR spectroscopy. Furthermore, when the concentration of OSA increased from 4 g/kg to 12 g/kg, the controlled aggregation of MP improved the gel properties of MP formed at high temperature, but when the concentration reached 24 g/kg, the protein aggregation was too inhibited to form developed gel networks.

Food Chemistry					Jackfruit seed starch (JFSS) was modified by an improved extrusion cooking technology (IECT), and the supramolecular structure, molecular weight, debranched chain length distributions, relative crystallinity (Rc), and amylose content, were studied. During IECT, the alpha-1.4-glycosidic bond in amylopectin was broken, which led to decreased radius of gyration (Rg), number-average molar mass (Mn), weight-average molar mass (Mw), long chains and Rc. The medium and short chains and PI (Mw/Mn) increased, while the amylose content hardly changed. The crystalline structure of JFSS was converted from A-type to V-type. Increasing the temperature and screw speed during the treatment significantly increased the medium and short chains and Rg, while it decreased the long chains, amylose, Mn, Mw, PI, and Rc. However, the opposite effect was observed when increasing the moisture content. The in vitro digestibility of JFSS was significantly improved after IECT, due to destruction of starch supramolecular structure according to principal component analysis.

Food Hydrocolloids					The starch isolated from Pouteria campechiana seeds and pulp is the novel underutilized tropical fruit resource. Pouteria campechiana seed starch (PCSS) had higher amylose content (33.65%), peak viscosity (PV) (4612 cP), breakdown viscosity (BDV) (1993 cP), pasting temperature (Tp) (74.45 °C), gelatinization enthalpy (DeltaH) (11.06 J/g), gel adhesiveness (-5.15 g-s), relative crystallinity (Rc) (22.68%), and short-range molecular order (0.740) than Pouteria campechiana pulp starch (PCPS) (16.63%, 4288 cP, 544 cP, 70.95 °C, 8.43 J/g, -10.22 g-s, 17.65%, and 0.675, respectively). Contrastingly, PCSS had lower final viscosity (FV) (3651 cP), setback viscosity (SBV) (1032 cP), gel hardness (173.69 g), water absorption capacity (WAC) (95.21%), and average particle size (7.26 mum) than PCPS (5763 cP, 2019 cP, 243.39 g, 122.86%, and 9.21 mum, respectively). PCSS and PCPS had A-type crystalline structures. A principal component analysis disclosed significantly positive correlations between 1047/1,022, amylose, Rc, Tp, DeltaH, and Pt (p < 0.05). Porosity, PV, BDV, FV, gel adhesiveness, gel hardness, and WAC were significantly positively correlated with particle size and SBV whereas 1047/1,022, amylose, Rc, Tp, Pt, and DeltaH were significantly negatively correlated with these parameters (p < 0.05). Thus, a theoretical reference for further empirical investigations into P. campechiana fruit and seed starch applications in the food industry has been provided.

J		Bo Liu; Hua Jiang; Haiyong Wang; Liu Yang							Removal of the N-terminal methionine improves the sweetness of the recombinant expressed sweet-tasting protein brazzein and its mutants in Escherichia coli.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The sweet-tasting protein brazzein is the smallest sweet protein with high sweet potency. Over expression of this protein in a heterogenous host is an essential way for its production in food industry. In this study, the gene of minor form brazzein was cloned into the pET-SUMO vector with optimized codon usage and expressed in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL. The recombinant protein in absence of the N-terminal methionine displayed a sweetness threshold about 1.5 mug/ml, which is the sweetest brazzein protein reported up to now. The unexpected sweet potency of the protein was validated by a series of mutants (7Val Arg, 9Glu Lys and 9Glu Asp), in which E9K exhibited about 50% enhancement of sweetness than the wild type. The superior sweetness of recombinant brazzein and its sweeter mutants suggest their potential applications in food and beverages. Practical applications. The sweet-tasting proteins are natural, low-, or non-caloric and nutritive, showing to be promising replacers of sugars and artificial sweeteners, and can be used as sweet additives in the fields of food, medicine, and biotechnology. In the present study, we report that the recombinant brazzein protein expressed in E. coli exhibits superior and improved sweetness than those previously reported. Furthermore, sweeter mutants were obtained with the expression procedure. The superior sweetness of recombinant brazzein and its sweeter mutants suggest their potential applications in food, beverages, and other fields. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13354					FSTA:2021-07-Tb2713

Food Chemistry					High-purity insoluble dietary fibre (HPIDF) was obtained from low-purity dietary fibre (LPDF) of Okara using a combined-enzyme method. For exploring the value of HPIDF as a functional food material, the structure, physicochemical properties, adsorption properties, potential bioactivities of HPIDF and their changes in different stages of digestion were explored in vitro. The results show that HPIDF shows a high perfect oil-holding capacity, higher viscosity, better cation exchange capacity, alpha-amylase activity ratio due to smaller particle size and larger specific surface area. The heavy metals-adsorption (Cd2+, Pb2+, Zn2+) shows the same, especially in simulated gastric fluid, which is similar to the adsorbability of glucose, cholesterol and acrylamide. Beyond the structure, the dissociation degree of some functional groups result from different digestive environments is the possible cause. Okara is an ideal material for the recovery of HPIDF, which has the potential to be processed into functional food materials.

Foods					In order to explore the changes and properties of high-purity insoluble dietary fiber from okara (HPIDF) after entering the colon and be fermented by colonic flora, fermented high-purity insoluble dietary fiber (F-HPIDF) was obtained by simulated fermentation in vitro by HPIDF and colonic flora from C57BL/6 mice. For exploring the differences of HPIDF and F-HPIDF, the changes of structure (SEM. FTIR, XRD, particle size, specific surface area, monosaccharide composition) and adsorption properties (water, oil, heavy metal irons, harmful substances) of HPIDF/F-HPIDF were explored. The results showed that F-HPIDF had a higher water-holding capacity (19.17 g/g), water-swelling capacity (24.83 mL/g), heavy metals-adsorption capacity (Cd2+: 1.82 mumol/g; Pb2+: 1.91 mumol/g; Zn2+: 1.30 mumol/g; Cu2+: 0.68 mumol/g), and harmful substances-adsorption capacity (GAC: 0.23 g/g; CAC: 14.80 mg/g; SCAC: 0.49 g/g) than HPIDF due to the changes of structure caused by fermentation. In addition, with the fermentation of HPIDF, some beneficial substances were produced, which might be potential intestinal prebiotics. The study of F-HPIDF strengthens the speculation that HPIDF may have potential bioactivities after entering the colon, which proved that okara-HPIDF may have potential functionality. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Diafiltration had been widely used in milk protein fractionation for almost thirty years to produce casein-enriched retentate. Among them, intermittent feed diafiltration was the only way ever used. But we noted some other diafiltration types had been used in other fields such as chemical engineering. In this study. The separation performance, chemical properties, component resistance and mass balance analysis were compared under different diafiltration types, aiming to find suitable diafiltration processes for milk protein fractionation. Research suggested that different diafiltration process may have different advantages. From the separation performance point of view, the highest removal rate of native whey proteins was observed under variable volume diafiltration (VVD) mode. But in terms of average flux, constant volume diafiltration (CVD) mode was utmost time and energy saving with an average flux of 81.25 kg m-2h-1. In addition, the percentage loss of protein under CVD and constant volume concentration ratio diafiltration (CVCRD) mode were significantly lower than that of other diafiltration modes (P < 0.05), indicating fewer protein were absorbed or compacted by the membrane. Therefore, diafiltration type should be selected according to the purpose of production.

Food Chemistry					The acquisition of resveratrol from Polygonum cuspidatum is complicated and costs organic solvents due to extraction and hydrolysis of its corresponding glycoside (polydatin). In this work, a novel one-pot method based on deep eutectic solvent (DES) was developed for simultaneous extraction and conversion of polydatin to resveratrol from Polygonum cuspidatum for the first time. The extraction yield of resveratrol by DES-based one-pot method were significantly higher than that of water, methanol and ethanol. After optimization by One-Variable-at-a-Time and response surface methodology, the extraction yield of resveratrol reached 12.260.14 mg/g within 80 min. The conversation efficiency of polydatin to resveratrol in Polygonum cuspidatum from five different origins was more than 96.3%. Scanning electron microscope results indicated the selected DES disrupted plant cell walls to enhance the yield of resveratrol. The results indicated that one green method was successfully established for efficient extraction and conversion of polydatin to resveratrol from Polygonum cuspidatum.

Food Chemistry					The effect of light exposure on sensory quality, health-promoting phytochemical contents, and antioxidant capacity in the lateral buds of baby mustard plants was investigated at ambient storage temperature (20 °C). The results showed that light exposure (36 mumol m-2 s-1) during post-harvest storage significantly prolonged shelf life (more than 1.75-fold), delayed the weight loss and the decrease of firmness. Light treatments also enhanced chlorophyll and carotenoid contents, and retarded declines in contents of soluble sugars, ascorbic acid, flavonoids and glucosinolates, as well as antioxidant capacity. The quality of baby mustard plants receiving 24 h daily light treatment was superior to those in plants receiving 12 h treatment and constant darkness at 20 °C. These findings indicate that light exposure, especially 24 h treatment, is an effective method of prolonging shelf life and maintaining sensory and nutritional qualities in baby mustard plants stored at ambient temperature.

J		Bo Teng; Hayasaka, Y.; Smith, P. A.; Bindon, K. A.							Precipitation of tannin-anthocyanin derivatives in wine is influenced by acetaldehyde concentration and tannin molecular mass with implications for the development of nonbleachable pigments.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					This study aimed to assess the effect of tannin molecular mass on nonbleachable pigment formation and subsequent stability under wine-like conditions. Tannin fractions of a defined molecular mass range were prepared from grape skins and seeds and reacted with malvidin-3-glucoside for 120 days in three media types: chemically defined wine media with or without acetaldehyde addition or model wine without acetaldehyde. Precipitation was observed after the reaction period and increased in response to both higher tannin molecular mass and acetaldehyde concentration. To confirm whether acetaldehyde-mediated condensation of tannin and anthocyanin modified the solubility of the nonbleachable pigments formed, HPLC-MS was used for the semiquantitative identification of vinyl derivatives and ethyl-linked adducts in soluble and precipitated materials. It was found that the proportion of vinyl derivatives and ethyl-linked anthocyanin was elevated in tannin precipitates relative to soluble pigmented material. Despite substantial losses of tannin due to precipitation, the resulting nonbleachable pigment concentration and color intensity were higher in wine media containing elevated acetaldehyde, when each tannin size category was considered independently. The results of this study indicated that the development of nonbleachable pigments from larger tannins may be limited when acetaldehyde-mediated condensation with anthocyanin predominates in wine, concomitant with precipitation.										2021	69	16	4804	4815	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00396					FSTA:2021-09-Hj8352

Foods					Nontargeted analysis can be used for the rapid screening and confirmatory analysis of veterinary drugs and their metabolites, which are important for the comprehensive safety evaluation of animal-derived foods. Here, a novel nontargeted screening approach based on liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-HR-MS) was developed to determine erythromycin, clarithromycin, and their metabolites in chicken liver microsomes. Erythromycin and clarithromycin were incubated in vitro in the presence of NADPH for 60 min to generate metabolites in chicken liver microsomes. After the incubation, the supernatant was extracted using ultrasonic shaking, orbital shaking, and centrifugation before analysis using LC/ESI-HR-MS in positive ion mode on an Agilent Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 mm*2.1 mm; i. D. 3.5 m) with 0.1 percent formic acid-water and acetonitrile As the mobile phases for gradient elution at 0.4 mL/min. The results show that erythromycin can produce N-desmethyl-erythromycin A in chicken liver microsomes, but clarithromycin cannot produce N-desmethyl-clarithromycin in chicken liver microsomes. The N-desmethyl-erythromycin A and N-desmethyl-clarithromycin were tentatively identified in chicken liver microsomes using the established quick analytic method, which will provide a theoretical foundation for future research on pharmacokinetics and drug elimination in poultry. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bo Wang; Xingang Zhao; Zhen Li; Hailing Luo; Hao Zhang; Yanping Guo; Can Zhang; Qing Ma							Changes of metabolites and gene expression under different feeding systems associated with lipid metabolism in lamb meat.		Foods					The effects of the different feeding systems, graze feeding (GSF), time-limited graze feeding (GF), and stall-feeding (SF)) on the fatty acid content, metabolites, and genes expression of the longissimus dorsi (LD) in Tan lambs were investigated in the present study. Thirty-nine 4-month-old male Tan lambs with similar body weight (24.91 1.74kg) were selected and divided into the three feeding systems (n = 13) randomly. Lambs were slaughtered after 83 days of the feeding trails, and LD muscle samples were collected for further analysis. The results indicated that different feeding systems have no significant effect on short-chain fatty acids in Tan lambs (p> 0.05). However, the total saturated fatty acids (SigmaSFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids (SigmaMUFA) in the GSF and GF groups were lower than those in the SF group (p< 0.001). The total polyunsaturated fatty acids (SigmaPUFA) in the GSF group were higher than those in the GF and SF groups (p< 0.001). Moreover, in the comparison of both GF vs GSF groups and SF vs GSF groups, metabolomic analysis showed that metabolites such as cis-(6,9,12)-linolenic acid, arachidic acid, acetylcarnitine, and L-carnitine with lower concentration were significantly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acid pathway (p< 0.05), but metabolites such as phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphocholine, cytidine 5-diphosphocholine, and glycerol-3-phosphate with higher concentrations were enriched in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway. KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) analysis of the results indicated that in the comparison of the GSF group with the SF group, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) such as LIPC, ERFE, FABP3, PLA2R1, LDLR, and SLC10A6, were enriched in the steroid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism pathways. In addition, differential metabolites and genes showed a significant correlation with the content of SigmaSFA, SigmaMUFA, and SigmaPUFA in lamb meat (p< 0.05). These findings demonstrated that the feeding system was an important factor in regulating fatty acid content by affecting lipid-metabolism-related metabolites and gene expression in muscle, and graze-feeding system provided lamb meat with higher SigmaPUFA content than time-limited-grazing and stall-feeding systems. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bo Wang; Zhenzhen Wang; Yong Chen; Xueliang Liu; Kun Liu; Yingjun Zhang; Hailing Luo							Carcass traits, meat quality, and volatile compounds of lamb meat from different restricted grazing time and indoor supplementary feeding systems.		Foods					This study was conducted to investigate the carcass traits, meat quality, and volatile compounds of growing lambs under different restricted grazing time and indoor supplementary feeding systems. Fifty 3-month-old male Tan lambs (with similar body weight) were divided into five groups randomly according to grazing time 12 h/d (G12), 8 h/d(G8), 4 h/d(G4), 2 h/d (G2), and 0 h (G0, indoor supplementary feeding). Animals were slaughtered at the end of the experiment, and the longissimus thoracis (LT) samples were collected for further analysis. The results indicated that indoor supplementary feeding improved the percentages of carcass fat and non-carcass fat of pre-slaughter weight (PSW) and decreased the cooking loss of lamb meat. Grazing for 8 h/d or 2 h/d enhanced PSW, carcass, and meat percentages of PSW. Lambs grazing for 2 h/d with supplement and indoor supplementary feeding lambs had a higher level of intramuscular fat and lightness (L*) value and lower cooking loss in the LT muscle, but higher yellowness (b*) and fat content were found in indoor supplementary feeding lambs. More categories of volatile compounds were identified in meat from grazing lambs than from indoor supplementary feeding lambs, but lower content of aldehydes and total volatile flavor compounds was detected in grazing lambs. Overall, the results demonstrated that the feeding system is a main factor that affects lamb meat quality, and proper grazing time can improve the quantity and quality of lamb meat and provide meat with different flavors to the consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

The results showed significant decreases in yield, shear force and L* and increases in a*, b* and the amounts of HAA of roasted pork with increased frying temperature and time (P<0.05). The highest score of overall acceptability in crispy and darker roast pork fried at 225 °C for 1min was obtained. However, the principal component analysis demonstrated that higher HAA contents of roasted pork under high frying temperature (225-250 °C) and long frying time (2-2.5min) occurred. Considering the various qualities and the amounts of HAA, frying roasted pork at 175 °C for 1.5-2min was the most suitable condition for preparing roasted pork.

Meat Science					The inhibitory effect of ice structuring protein (ISP) on the quality deterioration of quick-frozen pork patties subjected to multiple freeze-thaw (F-T) cycles was investigated. The inhibitory effect of ISP on patty quality deterioration was obvious after five F-T cycles (P< 0.05). The hardness and springiness of patties with 0.20% ISP were 3.84% and 10.61% higher than those of patties without ISP, and the thawing loss of patties with 0.20% ISP was 43.64% lower than that of patties without ISP (P< 0.05). In addition, ISP effectively restrained moisture migration and destruction of pork patty microstructure during F-T cycles. More importantly, thiobarbituric acid reactive substance levels and carbonyl contents in the patties with 0.20% ISP were 25% and 32% lower than those in the control group (no significant difference with patties with 0.30% ISP) after five F-T cycles. Therefore, these results illustrated the potential benefits of ISP in meat products.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study investigated the efficacy of 40-kHz (200W) ultrasonication (US) for 2min combined with glutathione (GSH) at 0.5% w/v (US + GSH) in preventing browning and preserving the physicochemical quality of lotus rhizome slices stored in a 41 °C refrigerator. According to the visual appearance of the slices, US + GSH treatment more effectively inhibited the browning of the cut surface than did GSH or US treatment alone. US+ GSH and GSH treatments were more effective than US and control treatments in preserving the slices' colour attributes, such as their lightness and whiteness index values, and potentially retarded enzymatic browning reactions and increases in browning index and total colour difference values. Moreover, the application of US and US + GSH treatments noticeably preserved the texture of the slices. None of the treatments affected the total sugar content during storage. The US + GSH treatment markedly enhanced the ferric reducing antioxidant potential of the slices during storage. The slices treated with US, GSH, and US + GSH exhibited slower reductions in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical scavenging activity than did the controls.

P.; Stanton, C.; Hao Zhang; Jianxin Zhao; Wei Chen							Protective effect of Bifidobacterium bifidum FSDJN7O5 and Bifidobacterium breve FHNFQ23M3 on diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.		Food & Function					Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the main bacterial cause of diarrhea among children in developing countries and of traveler's diarrhea. In this study, a mouse model was used to evaluate the effect of Bifidobacterium on alleviating diarrhea caused by ETEC. The results showed that B. breve FHNFQ23M3 and B. bifidum FSDJN7O5 could relieve the symptoms of diarrhea. Both strains significantly reduced the stool water content, restored the villi structure in the jejunum and ameliorated the fecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) content. In addition, B. breve FHNFQ23M3 restored body weight to the level before ETEC challenge and significantly reduced interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), while B. bifidum FSDJN7O5 significantly improved interleukin (IL)-10. Furthermore, all the Bifidobacterium strains used in this study could significantly downregulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and restore the unbalanced gut microbiota, which had a high content of pathogenic Escherichia-Shigella and low content of Blautia and Clostridium innocuum groups due to ETEC. All the results proved that Bifidobacterium could be a potential probiotic for alleviating diarrhea from ETEC infection. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	16	7271	7282	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00504a					FSTA:2021-12-Ad17605

Foods					Lactobacillus ruminis can stimulate the immune response in vitro, but previous studies were only carried out in vitro and the anti-inflammatory effects of L. ruminis needs more in vivo evidences. In this study, the immune regulation and potential mechanisms of L. ruminis was investigated in DSS-induced colitis mice. L. ruminis FXJWS27L3 and L. ruminis FXJSW17L1 relieved the symptoms of colitis, including inhibition of colon shortening and colon tissue damage. L. ruminis FXJWS27L3 significantly reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-17, while L. ruminis FXJSW17L1 significantly increased short chain fatty acids in mice feces. Moreover, L. ruminis FXJWS27L3 and L. ruminis FXJSW17L1 treatments significantly increased the gut microbiota diversity and balance the intestine microbiota profiles, which improved the imbalance of intestine microbiota composition to a certain extent. The results showed that L. ruminis can alleviate DSS-induced colitis, which possibly was related to promoting the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, up-regulating SCFAs and restoring the imbalance of gut microbiota. © 2021 by the authors.

P.; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Wei Chen							Lactobacillus reuteri FYNLJ109L1 attenuating metabolic syndrome in mice via gut microbiota modulation and alleviating inflammation.		Foods					Metabolic syndrome is caused by an excessive energy intake in a long-term, high-fat and/or high-sugar diet, resulting in obesity and a series of related complications, which has become a global health concern. Probiotics intervention can regulate the gut microbiota and relieve the systemic and chronic low-grade inflammation, which is an alternative to relieving metabolic syndrome. The aim of this work was to explore the alleviation of two different Lactobacillus reuteri strains on metabolic syndrome. Between the two L. reuteri strains, FYNLJ109L1 had a better improvement effect on blood glucose, blood lipid, liver tissue damage and other related indexes than NCIMB 30242. In particular, FYNLJ109L1 reduced weight gain, food intake and fat accumulation. Additionally, it can regulate the gut microbiota, increase IL-10, and reduce IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), as well as liver injury, and further reduce insulin resistance and regulate lipid metabolism disorders. In addition, it could modulate the gut microbiota, particularly a decreased Romboutsia and Clostridium sensu stricto-1, and an increased Acetatifactor. The results indicated that FYNLJ109L1 could improve metabolic syndrome significantly via alleviating inflammation and gut microbiota modulation. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bo Yang; Pu Zheng; Dan Wu; Pengcheng Chen							Efficient biosynthesis of raspberry ketone by engineered Escherichia coli coexpressing zingerone synthase and glucose dehydrogenase.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Raspberry ketone (RK), the main aroma compound of raspberry fruit, has applications in cosmetics, food industry, and pharmaceutics. In this study, we biosynthesized RK via the catalytic reduction of 4-hydroxybenzylidenacetone using a whole-cell biocatalyst. Reductase RiRZS1 from Rubus idaeus and glucose dehydrogenase SyGDH from Thermoplasma acidophilum were expressed in Escherichia coli to regenerate NADPH for the whole-cell catalytic reaction. Following the optimization of balancing the coexpression of two enzymes in pRSFDuet-1, we obtained 9.89 g/L RK with a conversion rate of 98% and a space-time yield of 4.94 g/ (L.H). The optimum conditions are 40 °C, pH 5.5, and a molar ratio of substrate to auxiliary substrate of 1:2.5. Our study findings provide a promising method of biosynthesizing RK.										2021	69	8	2549	2556	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07697					FSTA:2021-07-Jf9187

P.; Stanton, C.; Jianxin Zhao; Hao Zhang; Haiqin Chen; Wei Chen							Linoleate isomerase complex contributes to metabolism and remission of DSS-induced colitis in mice of Lactobacillus plantarum ZS2058.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A linoleate isomerase complex including myosin-cross-reactive antigen, short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase, and acetoacetate decarboxylase has been confirmed as the pivotal factor for conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) production in Lactobacillus plantarum. However, its role in the metabolism and health-associated benefits of Lactobacillus remain unclear. In the current study, the mild type, knockout, and complemented mutants of the linoleate isomerase complex of L. plantarum ZS2058 were used to investigate those putative effects. The metabonomic results showed that a linoleate isomerase complex could significantly influence the glycol-metabolism, lipid metabolism, and antioxidant compounds. Especially, with the stress of linoleic acid, linoleate isomerase complex knockout mutants induced the increase of several antioxidant compounds, such as glutamic acid, glycine, L-cysteine, glycerol, and L-sorbosone. Moreover, the linoleate isomerase complex played a pivotal role in ameliorating DSS-induced colitis. The knockout mutants showed effects similar to those in the DSS group, whereas complementation of the corresponding gene in the knockout mutants could restore the anti-inflammatory activity, wherein the integrity of a mucus layer was repaired, the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines decreased, and the amount of anti-inflammatory cytokines increased significantly. All the results indicated that the linoleate isomerase complex plays a key role in CLA production and metabolism as well as the health-associated benefits of L. plantarum ZS2058. These results are conducive to promote clinical trials and product development of probiotics for colitis.										2021	69	29	8160	8171	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02944					FSTA:2021-11-Ad16872
J		Bo Zhang; Hongzhou Li; Yan Li; Xiaoling Fu; Daolin Du							A sensitive chemiluminescence immunoassay based on immunomagnetic beads for quantitative detection of zearalenone.		European Food Research and Technology					Sensitive and rapid analysis of zearalenone (ZEN) in grains and feed is essential to guarantee the food security for human health. Herein a chemiluminescence method was demonstrated to measure the content of zearalenone in food samples. An immunomagnetic beads-anti-ZEN monoclonal antibody complex was prepared. Besides, the immunomagnetic beads were utilized as the solid support for rendering the immunoassay through the rapid formation of immune complexes in the solution, rapid separation and efficient heterogeneous detection. Under the optimal experimental parameters, the standard curve of ZEN detection is y= -0.3839x+0.1565 (R2=0.9978), the signal ratio has a well linear relationship with the logarithm of ZEN concentration in the range of 0.03-2.43 ng/mL. The limit detection of zearalenone in the developed assay was 0.01 ng/mL. The applicability of the reported approach for zearalenone detection in grains was demonstrated. In addition, the good recoveries of zearalenone were obtained, ranging from 85.15 to 102.60% at 5,50, 150 ng/g spiked ZEN concentrations. The relative standard deviation was <10%. The proposed chemiluminescence immunoassay is sensitive, simple, rapid and reliable for monitoring of zearalenone contamination, which provides a powerful avenue for further application of other mycotoxin in food analysis. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	9	2171	2181	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03777-z					FSTA:2021-12-Cd3470

Food Bioscience					As the key precursor of coenzyme A synthesis in vivo, D-pantothenic acid plays an important role in maintaining biological function, which is widely applied in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries. At present, it was mainly produced by chemical methods, with serious environmental pollution, therefore, it is urgent to develop an economical, practical, and environmentally friendly biological fermentation method based on microbial chassis cells. Herein, based on our previously developed D-pantothenic acid producing strains, we obtained higher yielding D-pantothenic acid producing strains by systematic metabolic engineering. First, according to the results of CRISPRi experiments, lpd were overexpressed, disrupted the non-PTS (non-phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate transport system) as well as enhanced the PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate transport system) allowing precursor accumulation. Subsequently, based on the analysis of metabolic intermediates, the pyruvate bypass pathway was blocked as well as the (R)-pantothenic acid pathway was further enhanced, increasing the titer of D-pantothenic acid to 4.60 g/L. Finally, the organic acid and branched-chain amino acid synthesis pathways were blocked, and in order to accelerate the synthesis of acetolactate and the output of D-pantothenic acid, heterologous acetolactate synthase and pantothenate transfer protein were introduced, which significantly increased the yield of D-pantothenic acid, reach to 6.33 g/L. The final strain in a 5 L bioreactor produced 32.32 g/L D-pantothenic acid with a productivity of 2.33 g/L/h and the high-yielding strain provides an effective platform for biological fermentation to produce D-pantothenic acid.

Food Chemistry					Chinese black truffle (Tuber indicum) is rich in nutrition. However, commercial interests lead to the aroma components and nutrients of T. indicum being greatly affected by overexploitation without consideration of their maturity. This study investigated the proteomic and metabolomic profiles of truffle fruiting bodies at different maturities using a meta-proteomic approach. Among the 3007 identified proteins, the most up-expressed protein in the mature ascocarps was involved in the peptidyl-diphthamide biosynthetic process, while thiamine metabolism was the most differentially expressed pathway. Furthermore, a total of 54 metabolites identified upon LC-MS differed significantly, with 30 being up-expressed in the mature ascocarps, including organic acids, carnitine substances and polysaccharides. Additionally, the ash, protein, fat, crude fiber and total sugar contents were all higher in the mature ascocarps. Overall, our findings reveal that mature truffles have a higher nutritional value, providing a basis for further exploring protein functionality of T. indicum at different maturities.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Although phenolic copigments are rarely colored, they can still influence color expression in red wine copigmentation. Here, prefermentative agents, such as caffeic and rosmarinic acids, were added as copigments during Cabernet Sauvignon red winemaking. The evolution of colors and polyphenols was analyzed by tristimulus colorimetry and high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry during brewing and aging periods. The results showed that the addition of caffeic and rosmarinic copigments was beneficial to obtain more saturated and vivid hue of wines. The changes in color were correlated with a significant increase in anthocyanins concentration. Moreover, the results demonstrated that the addition of the two phenolic copigments increased the concentration of total phenols and enhanced the copigmentation effect, indicating improved chromatic intensity and color stability of wines. Therefore, the addition of caffeic and rosmarinic acids is a simple and useful enological technique to obtain red wines with high color quality and aging potential.

Journal of Food Science					A lyophilized powder of Lactobacillus rhamnosus MP108, a strain isolated from infant feces, has been developed for potential as a probiotic. To assess safety, three genetic toxicity studies (Ames, in vivo mouse micronucleus, and in vivo mouse spermatocyte chromosome aberration assays) and one 90-day oral rat toxicity study were conducted. Lactobacillus rhamnosus MP108 had no activity in the Ames assay, with or without metabolic activation, up to the highest dose tested (5000 g/plate). Also, no evidence of genotoxicity was observed in the two in vivo genotoxicity assays up to the maximum dose tested of 5.6 g/kg body weight. Feeding of L. rhamnosus MP108 to SD rats at doses of 0, 0.25, 0.5, or 1.5 g/kg body weight/day had no statistically or biologically significant effects on any of the parameters measured. An evaluation of Lactobacillus spp. Generally, and L. rhamnosus specifically, showed no indication of concern for translocation or pathogenicity. The results of the toxicology studies showed no indications for safety concerns. Practical Application. Lactobacillus rhamnosus MP108 Is a bacterium that shows potential as a probiotic. While this bacterium has been used in food and food production, a series of studies were conducted to provide further assurance that this particular strain of L. rhamnosus is safe. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	1	228	241	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15546					FSTA:2021-05-Ad8113

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Normal and waxy wheat starches were subjected to dry-heat treatment for physical modification. The influence of repeated (RDH) versus continuous dry-heating (CDH) on the performance of wheat starch with different amylose content was investigated. Native waxy starch illustrated greater crystallinity, solubility, swelling power, peak viscosity and thermal properties than normal wheat starch. The dry-heating could not transform the crystalline structure, wheat starches remained A-type. Additionally, dry-heated samples showed lower transition temperatures and pasting properties, but higher crystallinity and solubility. Dry-heating increased gelatinization enthalpy in normal wheat starch, but reduced this value in waxy ones. Furthermore, RDH can highly influence starch characteristics due to the cooling procedure compared to CDH under the same duration. The differences between RDH and CDH starches were expected to be suitable for varied food and non-food industries.

J		Bo-Min Kim; Hyeon-Jeong Lee; Yeong H. Song; Hyun-Jin Kim							Effect of salt stress on the growth, mineral contents, and metabolite profiles of spinach.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Increased soil salt concentration decreases productivity and changes the physiological and chemical properties of plants. Various omics technologies have been used to understand the salt response in plants but overall changes in the metabolite profiles of spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) under salt stress have not been studied. In this article, therefore, the changes in mineral and metabolite profiles of spinach plants cultivated with different NaCl concentrations of 0-200mmol L-1 in the irrigation water were analyzed to investigate the effect of salt stress on nutritional quality. Results. Increasing NaCl concentration decreased plant growth due to mineral imbalance. The amounts of minerals (K+, Ca2+, and Fe2+) were reduced with increasing NaCl concentration, resulting in altered ratios of Na+: K+ and Na+: Ca2+. The change in the mineral ratios due to NaCl irrigation led to a decrease in the height and an increase in the weight of spinach. Moreover, the profiles of 32 metabolites, including flavonoids, amino acids, acidic compounds, sugars, and lipid-related compounds, were altered by NaCl irrigation; most of them showed decreased levels. In particular, at 200mmol L-1 NaCl, the levels of sucrose, glutamic acid, hexose sugars, and acidic compounds significantly decreased upon NaCl irrigation. Based on these metabolites, a salt-stress-related spinach metabolomic pathway was proposed. Conclusion. Sodium chloride irrigation increased mineral imbalance, resulting in decreased plant growth, and the levels of most metabolites involved in energy production, sensory quality, and health benefits decreased with NaCl irrigation. The results suggest that NaCl irrigation negatively affects the nutritional quality of spinach. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3787	3794	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11011					FSTA:2021-10-Jq12941
J		Bo-Yu Chen; Qing-An Zhang; Bao-Shan Zhang; Ya-Feng Zhang; Er-Chun Li							Effects of ultrasound on the formation of oxidative pigments in a model red wine solution containing glutathione.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Xanthylium cations and its ethyl ester are important pigments derived from (+)-catechin and glyoxylic acid in wine. In this paper, ultrasound treatment was applied in model wine containing glutathione to study its effects on the formation of xanthylium cation pigments triggered by free radicals from the ultrasound cavitation. The changes in color parameters, concentration of pigment compounds and free radicals were investigated during wine storage by the means of ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometer, colorimeter, high performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), respectively. Results indicate that longer ultrasonic treatment in conjunction with glutathione can significantly enhance the formation of xanthylium cation pigments and accelerate the red wine color evolution, and no extra (+)-catechin was involved, which might be attributed to the stronger 1-hydroxyethyl radicals intensity induced by ultrasound irradiation. In summary, ultrasound treatment can accelerate the oxidative coloration of wine with GSH during ageing, which would contribute to well understand the changing mechanism of wine color properties modified by ultrasound.

Beta-glucan interaction with lentil (Lens culinaris) and yellow pea (Pisum sativum) proteins suppresses their in vitro digestibility.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					In this study, beta-glucan interaction with lentil and yellow pea proteins and the effect on in vitro protein digestibility were investigated. Proteins were mixed with beta-glucan at mass ratios of 1:0.5, 1:1, and 1:2. The interaction between beta-glucan and the proteins was demonstrated by the decrease in transmittance and surface charge and the increase in particle size of the complexes. Bright-field microscopy showed the formation of aggregates between the biopolymers, although increased molecular size was not observed by discontinuous native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Fluorescence microscopy indicated that beta-glucan formed aggregates with lentil proteins, while the interaction with yellow pea proteins appeared as distinct phases of protein within the beta-glucan network. The in vitro protein digestibility of lentil and pea protein decreased by 27.3 and 34.5%, respectively, in the presence of a beta-glucan mass ratio of 1:2. The findings confirm the possibility to modulate protein digestibility by changing the physical characteristics of a food matrix.		fogliano, vincenzo/W-6885-2019; fogliano, vincenzo/A-1419-2009	fogliano, vincenzo/0000-0001-8786-9355; fogliano, vincenzo/0000-0001-8786-9355; Udenigwe, Chibuike/0000-0001-8802-7707							2021	69	36	10630	10637	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03022					FSTA:2022-01-Jp0701

Food & Function					The pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediates the resistance of sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by promoting the clearance or elimination of sorafenib via the drug resistance-related downstream genes of the PXR. Previously, we revealed that rhamnetin (a flavonoid functioning as an inhibitor of sirtuin (Sirt) 1) could inhibit expression of the downstream gene of the PXR: multidrug resistance 1 (mdr-1). However, how rhamnetin regulates the PXR pathway in HCC cells is not known. Here, we demonstrated that rhamnetin decelerated elimination of the molecular-targeting agent sorafenib in HCC cells via the microRNA (miR)-148a/PXR axis. Rhamnetin treatment decreased expression of the drug resistance-related downstream genes of PXR (cyp3a4 [cytochrome P-450] or mdr-1 [multi-drug resistance 1]), which mediate the metabolism or elimination of sorafenib in HCC cells. Mechanistically, rhamnetin increased expression of miR-148a (which is tumor-suppressive) in a P53-dependent manner, leading to inhibition of PXR expression and decrease in expression of its downstream genes. Rhamnetin enhanced miRNA-148a transcription by repressing Sirt1 activation to enhance acetylation at residue-373 of P53. Rhamnetin treatment decelerated the metabolic clearance of sorafenib in HCC cells and enhanced the sensitivity of HCC cells to sorafenib. Our results suggest that rhamnetin could be a potential agent for overcoming sorafenib resistance in HCC treatment. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	6	2404	2417	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02270e					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10719
J		Boateng, I. D.; Xiao-Ming Yang							Thermal and non-thermal processing affect Maillard reaction products, flavor, and phytochemical profiles of Ginkgo biloba seed.		Food Bioscience					Works of literature focused on the standardization of Ginkgo biloba extract from the dried ginkgo leaves, and little research has been done on ginkgo seed as a functional food and a nutraceutical. Drying can have beneficial effects on phytochemicals, flavor as well as improving their bio-accessibility or modifying chemical structures to enhance absorption. In this study, Ginkgo biloba seed (GBS) was dehydrated using non-thermal (freeze-drying) and thermal (infrared-drying, hot-air drying, pulsed-vacuum drying) processing. A comparative analysis were performed using UV-Vis spectrophotometer, fluorescence spectrophotometer, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), gas chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy (GC-MS/MS), and electronic nose (E-nose). Results showed drying methods had a significant influence on Maillard reaction products, flavor, and phytochemical profiles, while FTIR analysis showed drying methods did not change preliminary structures. GC-MS/MS showed many phytoconstituents that led to a better appreciation of nutraceutical, pharmaceutical, and medicinal benefits. These compounds consist of fatty alcohol, long-chain alkanes, fatty acids, carboxylic acid, sterols, diterpenes, triterpenes, flavonoids, and their derivatives. The infrared-dried GBS had the highest (61) phytoconstituent, while pulsed-vacuum dried ginkgo seeds the least (24). Electronic nose differentiated flavor intensity of dried ginkgo seed, with freeze-drying exhibiting the least intensity. The principal component analysis combined with GC-MS/MS and E-nose differentiated samples and was attested by Hierarchical cluster analysis. Infrared-dried product was superior with the highest Maillard reaction (highest A294 and A420). These data will provide vital information for selecting a befitting drying method for ginkgo seed processing and GBS application as a nutraceutical. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					In this research, Ginkgo biloba L. Seeds (GBS) were freeze-dried, infrared-dried, hot-air dried, and pulsed-vacuum dried. A detailed analysis of their drying kinetics (drying curve, drying rate curve, effective moisture diffusivity, mathematical modeling), shrinkage and energy efficiency (specific moisture extraction, specific energy consumption), and physicochemical properties (soluble solids, total sugar, reducing sugar, ascorbic acid, phenolics, and tannins) were performed. Results. Showed drying methods had various effects on different indexes and were confirmed by principal component analysis. The drying process occurred in the falling-rate period. The effective moisture diffusivity values amongst various drying methods ranged from 3.5 *10-8 to 7.6 *10-8 m2/s, which were within the normally expected range for food materials. The exponential model best fitted the experimental results for drying with coefficient of determination (R2) >.981 and root mean square error, sum of square error, and reduced chi-square closer to zero than the parabolic and inverse-logarithmic (Log3p1) models. The freeze-dried GBS had the highest nutritional (statistically the same with the fresh GBS) and lower shrinkage; nevertheless, it had the lowest moisture extraction rate and the highest energy consumption. Hot-air dried GBS had the highest shrinkage and lowest nutritional retention. Infrared-dried GBS was superior with the highest non-tannic phenolic, proanthocyanidins content, effective moisture diffusivity, drying rates, and energy efficiency. The current findings indicate that infrared drying is a promising drying technology for GBS and has the potential to be applied on a commercial scale. Practical application. Ginkgo seeds (GBS) are utilized as functional food across Asia. In China, ginkgo trees' extensive cultivation has surpassed market requirements, as GBS production could reach 60,000 tons per year. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find new opportunities to take advantage of the availability and usage of GBS regardless of the season and overcome the situation that GBS usage only remains at incipient phases of home-cooked recipes. Drying is a common approach to preserve foods'. Nonetheless, there are some drawbacks to conventional drying method, such as low energy efficiency, lengthy process periods, and a decline in quality attributes. The infrared dryer provided a reduced drying time, highest drying rate, energy efficiency, and good quality; thus, it could be applied in the food industry to hot air and freeze-drying, allowing the drying method for GBS faster. The research provided a predictive mathematical model for the parameter control GBS drying process. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Science					This study evaluated the mass transfer, drying, and rehydration kinetics (drying and rehydration curve, moisture diffusivity [Deff]), energy consumption (specific energy consumption [SEC], moisture extraction rate (MER), and specific moisture extraction rate [SMER]), and mathematical modeling of infrared dried Ginkgo biloba seed (GBS) using the various nonthermal pretreatments namely: osmotic (OS), osmovacuum (V + OS), ultrasound (US, ginkgo seed immersed in a distilled water with US), and osmosonication (US+ OS, ginkgo seeds immersed in an OS solution with US). Results showed that various pretreatments affected mass transfer, drying, and rehydration characteristics, and energy consumption, which was confirmed by principal component analysis. In terms of mass transfer, US pretreatment recorded the highest weight loss while the osmosonication pretreatment registered the highest solid gain. The entire drying process occurred in the falling-rate period. The Deff values were within the normal range of agroproducts (10-11 to 10-8 m2/s). The modified Page-I and Weibull model best fitted the drying and rehydration kinetics, respectively, with the coefficient of determination (R2) > 0.991, root mean square error, residual sum of squares, and reduced chi-square closer to zero, compared with the other models. The untreated GBS (control) had the lowest energy efficiency (lowest SMER and MER) and the highest SEC than the pretreated GBS. Among the various pretreatments, the US pretreatment of GBS was superior, with the highest Deff, MER, SMER, and drying rate, and lowest drying time and SEC. Based on the findings, sequential US pretreatment and infrared drying is a feasible drying technique for GBS that could be used commercially. Practical Application. Ginkgo tree cultivation in China has exceeded market needs with 60,000 tons per annum of GBS produced. Hence, there is a compelling need to explore new chances to use GBS availability irrespective of the seasonality and address the problem where GBS utilization is limited to the early phases of home-cooked dishes. Although drying increases the shelf life of ginkgo seeds, there is a higher operation cost. Thus, pretreatment can reduce energy consumption and augment the product quality is ideal. This research reported the impact of non-thermal pretreatments on ginkgo seeds' mass transfer, drying, and rehydration characteristics. The present results will provide a comprehensive understanding of the engineering application of ginkgo seed pretreatment, allowing for the best technique to be selected. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Hydrolysable tannins in Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell fruit powder and comparison of their functional properties from different solvent extracts.		Food Chemistry					This study identified and quantified hydrolysable tannins (HTs) in Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell (Kakadu plum) fruit, freeze dried powder extracted with 80% aqueous acetone (AA) and 80% aqueous acidified ethanol (AAE), using UHPLC-Q/Orbitrap/MS/MS. The vitamin C and ellagic acid were quantified by UHPLC-PDA. A total of seven HTs were identified: corilagin, 3,4, 6-tri-O-galloyl-beta-d-glucose, elaeocarpusin, chebulinic acid, chebulagic acid, helioscopin B, and punicalagin, with five classified as ellagitannins. The two extracts AA and AAE, comprised of gallic acid (2.5 and 2.2 mg/g DW), punicalagins alpha and beta (2.8 and 1.3 mg/g DW), respectively, and both contained ellagic acid (~4 g/100 g DW). These extracts showed high antioxidant properties and strong antimicrobial effects against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clinical isolate, Staphylococcus aureus, and Shewanella putrefaciens. These results suggest that Kakadu plum fruit is a rich, edible source of ellagitannins, ellagic acid and vitamin C with potential applications in food, cosmetic and nutraceutical industries.

Detection of changes in total antioxidant capacity, the content of polyphenols, caffeine, and heavy metals of teas in relation to their origin and fermentation.		Foods					Tea (Camellia sinensis) is widely sought for beverages worldwide. Heavy metals are often the main aims of the survey of teas, given that the use of agricultural fertilization is very frequent. Some of these may affect the content of bioactive compounds. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed fermented and non-fermented teas of a single plant origin from Japan, Nepal, Korea, and China, and described mutual correlations and changes in the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and the content of polyphenols (TPC), caffeine, and heavy metals in tea leaves, in relation to the origin and fermentation process. Using UV-VIS spectrophotometry and HPLC-DAD, we determined variations in bioactive compounds' content in relation to the fermentation process and origin and observed negative correlations between TAC and TPC. Heavy metal content followed this order: Mn > Fe > Cu > Zn > Ni > Cr > Pb > Co > Cd > Hg. Given the homogenous content of these elements in relation to fermentation, this paper also describes the possibility of using heavy metals as determinants of geographical origin. Linear Discriminant Analysis showed an accuracy of 75% for Ni, Co, Cd, Hg, and Pb, explaining 95.19% of the variability between geographical regions. © 2021 by the authors.

Most national, mandatory flour fortification standards do not align with international recommendations for iron, zinc, and vitamin B12 levels.		Food Policy					As national flour fortification standards are one of the policy documents developed to guide food fortification, the objective was to compare national, mandatory wheat and maize flour fortification standards to World Health Organization (WHO) fortification guidelines. For each nutrient in 72 countries' standards, the type of compound was noted as "yes" if it was included in international guidelines or "no" if it was not. Nutrient levels in standards were classified as lower than, equal to, or higher than those suggested by WHO. If another food (i.e.rice, oil, milk) was mass fortified with a nutrient categorized as "lower than," the classification was changed to "less than recommendation and included in other mass fortified food". At least 61% of standards included one or more recommended compounds for all nutrients in standards for wheat flour alone (iron, folic acid, vitamin A, zinc, vitamin B12,), wheat and maize flour together (iron, folic acid, vitamin A, zinc, vitamin B12) and maize flour alone (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine); no country included pantothenic acid in its maize flour standard. For folic acid, vitamin A, thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and pyridoxine, at least 50% of standards (1) met or exceeded WHO suggested levels, or (2) were lower than suggested levels and another food was mass fortified with the specific nutrient in the country. For iron, zinc and vitamin B12, less than 50% of standards met (1) or (2). In conclusion, iron, zinc and vitamin B12 may require the most attention in national fortification standards.

J		Bobryk-Mamczarz, A.; Kieltyka-Dadasiewicz, A.; Rachon, L.							Usefulness of hulled wheats grown in polish environment for wholegrain pasta-making.		Foods					The best pasta raw material is durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.). Recently, old wheat species have also attracted interest. The aim of the study was to evaluate their usefulness for industrial pasta production. The technological characteristics of grains and the organoleptic characteristics of pasta obtained from hulled emmer (T. turgidum subsp. dicoccum) and spelt (T. aestivum ssp. spelta) were determined and compared to durum wheat, as a standard pasta raw material, and common wheat (T. aestivum). All wheats were grown under identical conditions. The hardness of kernels was assessed using the practical size index, wheat hardness index, torque moment, milling work of 50 g of flour, semolina yield, and starch damage. The technological and nutritional values of semolina, i.e., protein and ash content, wet gluten yield and quality, and falling number, were determined. Moreover, the organoleptic characteristics of cooked pasta were analysed in terms of appearance, colour, taste, smell, and consistency. The milling parameters of emmer were comparable to those of durum wheat; moreover, the content of protein, gluten, and ash was higher in emmer. Spelt was found to be similar to common wheat. Hulled wheats, especially emmer, show good quality parameters and can be an alternative raw material for industrial pasta production. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Foods					Chronic alcohol consumption can cause hepatic injury and alcohol-induced toxicities. Extracts from Smilax china root have been widely used in traditional medicine and for their potential pharmacological benefits. We aimed to determine if fermented Smilax china extract (FSC) regulates alcoholic fatty liver and liver injury using two in vivo experiments. Sprague-Dawley rats were administered ethanol (3 g/kg b. W.; po) with or without FSC pretreatment to induce an acute hangover. In another experiment, rats were fed either a normal or Lieber-DeCarli ethanol (6.7%) diet with or without FSC pretreatment (125, 250, and 500 mg/kg b. w.; po) for 28 days. Serum biomarkers, liver histopathology, and the mRNA levels of anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, lipogenic, and lipolytic genes were analyzed. FSC pretreatment significantly reduced blood alcohol and acetaldehyde concentrations, upregulated the mRNA expression of alcohol dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase, and decreased the activities of liver enzymes in a dose-dependent manner. It also downregulated SERBP-1c and upregulated PPAR-alpha and reduced the gene expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 in the liver. The final extract after fermentation had increased GABA content. Furthermore, FSC was found to be safe with no acute oral toxicity in female rats. Thus, FSC increases alcohol metabolism and exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects to induce hepatoprotection against alcohol-induced damage. It may be used as a functional food ingredient after excess alcohol consumption. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bocate, K. P.; Evangelista, A. G.; Luciano, F. B.							Garlic essential oil as an antifungal and anti-mycotoxin agent in stored corn.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Corn kernels are highly susceptible to fungal and mycotoxin contamination. This study verified the effectiveness of garlic essential oil (GEO) to inhibit Aspergillus parasiticus, Fusarium verticillioides, and Gibberella zeae, producers of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), fumonisin B1 (FB1), and zearalenone (ZEA), respectively, in stored corn kernels. The potential of the oil to interact with these mycotoxins and their bioaccessibility after swine simulated digestion was also evaluated. GEO showed minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for A. parasiticus, G. zeae, and F. verticillioides of 0.0086, 0.069, and 0.0086 mg/mL, respectively, and minimal fungicidal concentrations (MFCs) four-fold greater than the MIC. Fungal growth was reduced completely by gaseous GEO at a range between 2 and 10 muL/L. The population of A. parasiticus and G. zeae was reduced to levels below the detection limit, whereas F. verticillioides had a 2.33 Log UFC/g reduction after 30 d of storage when contaminated corn kernels were treated with 1000 muL/L of GEO. GEO was not able to directly react with either AFB1, FB1, or ZEA in phosphate buffer or during simulated digestion. The results of our study confirmed that GEO can avoid the growth of mycotoxigenic fungi and, therefore, may be used to improve safety of stored corn kernels.

The combined effect of fermentation of lactic acid bacteria and in vitro digestion on metabolomic and oligosaccharide profile of oat beverage.		Food Research International					Oat (Avena sativa L.) is widely appreciated for its beneficial properties for human health, which have led to the introduction of more food products on the market, including oat beverages. The fibre components found in the oat are recognized for their beneficial effects, despite other bioactive compounds with healthy properties being present. This work aimed to evaluate the metabolites profile of a commercial oat beverage, either fermented with lactic bacteria or not, following in vitro gastro-intestinal digestion. UHPLC-QTOF untargeted metabolomics allowed investigation of the bioaccessibility of health-related metabolites from the oat beverage at the intestinal level. The results identified flavonoids, phenolic acids (avenanthramides), amino acids and steroids as the major classes of compounds. In particular, after in vitro digestion, amino acids, peptides, and phenolic acids showed the highest increases. The co-fermentation of oat milk by Lactobacillus spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. strains decreased the levels of both lignans and phytic acid, while increased the levels of some polyphenols like avenanthramides. Furthermore, fermentation by microorganisms increased the bioaccessibility of specific amino acids, vitamins, and polyphenols (flavonoids and phenolic acids). Interestingly, despite lacking a significant part of beta-glucans, the HPAEC-PAD profiling of our oat beverage evidenced that the fermentation process did not alter the oligosaccharides profile, thus preserving its prebiotic potential. The phytochemical profile of oat milk was shown to have a functional potential. Nonetheless, the fermentation by bacterial strains changed the profile of metabolites during in vitro digestion, thus offering an interesting option in the future development of cereal-based beverages.

J		Bochetto, A.; Merino, N.; Kaplan, M.; Guinez, M.; Cerutti, S.							Design of a combined microextraction and back-extraction technique for the analysis of mycotoxins in amaranth seeds.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A methodology was optimized for the determination of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol and zearalenone in Amaranthus-based samples. The extraction/preconcentration procedure consisted of an in-phase liquid-liquid microextraction based on the solidification of a floating organic drop followed by a double solvent-assisted back-extraction combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (DLLME-SFO-SBE). The solvent assisted back-extraction enabled the direct injection of deoxynivalenol (DON) and zearalenone (ZEA) in the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry system configured with an electrospray source operated in a positive polarity mode (UHPLC-ESI+-MS/MS). Parameters affecting the efficiency of the back-extraction procedure were evaluated and optimized, including the nature of the back-extractant volume and the agitation effect. Detection and quantification limits were in the range of 0.07-0.73mug kg-1 and 0.22-0.91mug kg-1. Acceptable extraction recoveries between 80.35 and 100.05% and enrichment factors between 16 and 20-fold, with relative standard deviations < 10.12%, were obtained. The method was successfully applied to the analysis of different types of Amaranthus samples. Concentration levels of deoxynivalenol from 10.62-76.86mug kg-1 and zearalenone from 9.18-89.29mug kg-1, were detected in seeds, flours, and the burst of Amaranthus. The proposed methodology is an easy, sensitive, and accurate analytical approach to determine deoxynivalenol and zearalenone in the mentioned food samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bochnia, M.; Ziegler, J.; Glatter, M.; Zeyner, A.							Hypoglycin A in cow's milk-a pilot study.		Toxins					Hypoglycin A (HGA) originating from soapberry fruits (litchi, and ackee) seeds or seedlings from the sycamore maple (SM) tree (related to Sapindaceae) may cause Jamaican vomiting sickness in humans and atypical myopathy in horses and ruminants. A possible transfer into dairy cow's milk cannot be ruled out since the literature has revealed HGA in the milk of mares and in the offal of captured deer following HGA intoxication. From a study, carried out for another purpose, bulk raw milk samples from four randomly selected dairy farms were available. The cows were pastured in the daytime. A sycamore maple tree was found on the pasture of farm No. 1 only. Bulk milk from the individual tank or milk filling station was sampled in parallels and analyzed for HGA by LC-ESI-MS/MS. Measurable concentrations of HGA occurred only in milk from farm No. 1 and amounted to 120 and 489 nmol/L. Despite low and very variable HGA concentrations, the results indicate that the ingested toxin, once eaten, is transferred into the milk. However, it is unknown how much HGA the individual cow ingested during grazing and what amount was transferred into the bulk milk samples. As a prerequisite for a possible future safety assessment, carry-over studies are needed. Furthermore, the toxins' stability during milk processing should also be investigated as well. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparison of the chemical and technological characteristics of wholemeal flours obtained from amaranth (Amaranthus sp.), quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) and buckwheat (Fagopyrum sp.) seeds.		Foods					A sound fundamental knowledge of the seed and flour characteristics of pseudocereals is crucial to be able to promote their industrial use. As a first step towards a more efficient and successful application, this study focuses on the seed characteristics, chemical composition and technological properties of commercially available pseudocereals (amaranth, quinoa, buckwheat). The levels of starch, fat, dietary fiber and minerals were comparable for amaranth and quinoa seeds but the protein content is higher in amaranth. Due to the high amount of starch, buckwheat seeds are characterised by the lowest amounts of fat, dietary fibre and minerals. Its protein content ranged between that of amaranth and quinoa. Buckwheat seeds were larger but easily reduced in size. The lipid fraction of the pseudocereals mostly contained unsaturated fatty acids, with the highest prevalence of linoleic and oleic acid. Palmitic acid is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid. Moreover, high levels of P, K and Mg were found in these pseudocereals. The highest phenolic content was found in buckwheat. Amaranth WMF (wholemeal flour) had a high swelling power but low shear stability. The pasting profile strongly varied among the different quinoa WMFs. Buckwheat WMFs showed high shear stability and rate of retrogradation. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Quinoa kernels are generally whole-milled due to their small kernel size. However, roller milling allows the separation of the starchy perisperm from the protein- and fat-rich bran fraction. Both fractions can be used for specific food applications. Studies have focused on roller milling of quinoa but information on tempering is rather limited. This study investigates the impact of different tempering conditions on roller milling of quinoa. Three types of commercially available quinoa seeds were roller-milled on small scale by a Brabender Quadrumat Junior. Two levels of tempering time (8 and 20 h) were combined with three levels of tempered moisture (13, 15 and 17%). Flour yield was recorded and the obtained flour was characterised by moisture, ash and protein content, flour colour index (FCI) and particle size distribution (PSD). An increase in tempered moisture reduced the flour yield, while a change in tempering time had no effect on two out of three samples. Flour composition depended on the combination of tempering conditions but increasing tempered moisture generally resulted in a better bran-perisperm separation. Differences in kernel properties were reflected in the PSD: small kernels created a coarser flour with higher ash and protein content.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					EU regulation No. 1169/2011 states that foods that have been frozen and thawed before being sold, the name shall be accompanied by the designation "defrosted". This requirement does not apply when defrosting has no negative impact on their safety and quality. Producers should be able to show that defrosting has no negative impact during the shelf-life. Therefore, the impact of temporary frozen storage on the quality and safety of industrially produced bakery products, including wholemeal bread, sandwich rolls, sponge cake and pie, was studied in comparison with non-frozen products. Total plate count, aw, texture analysis and sensory analysis were applied to assess microbial, physico-chemical quality and consumer acceptability of the products. All tests were performed before and after the defrosted shelf-life period. Freezing and defrosting of bakery products did not enhance microbial spoilage. All values remained under the maximal limit of microbial contamination, respectively 5 log CFU/g for bread products and 4 log CFU/g for sponge cake and pie. Texture analysis and aw showed only limited differences between fresh and defrosted products. Although a slight difference in texture was observed for sandwich rolls, sponge cake and pie through sensory trials, all products were found acceptable for consumption.

J		Bockuviene, A.; Zalneravicius, R.; Sereikaite, J.							Preparation, characterization and stability investigation of lycopene-chitooligosaccharides complexes.		Food Bioscience					The application of lycopene has been increased in the food industry as well as in medicine. However, lycopene is unstable, sensitive to the oxidation and degrades under the exposure to high temperature, light and extreme pH. A new lycopene delivery system was developed by complexing lycopene with chitooligosaccharides. The complexes were prepared by sonication, freeze-drying and kneading methods. The sonication and freeze-drying resulted in the best characteristics of complexes. The solubility of complexes prepared by those methods was 10.8-12.9 mg/mL, while the solubility of complexes obtained by kneading was 2.8-2.9 mg/mL. The size of particles prepared by kneading, freeze-drying and sonication was in the range of 358-400,75.9-84.1 and 102-105 nm, respectively. The stability of complexes under different conditions, i.e., in the dark at 4 and 24 °C, in the light at 24 °C and under UVC irradiation in the dark at 24 °C was evaluated. The antioxidant activity of complexes and chitooligosaccharides was also determined. The complexation of lycopene with chitooligosaccharides extends the possibility for its application in the development of functional food. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A.							beta-glucan production by Levilactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus claussenii for in situ enriched rye and wheat sourdough breads.		Foods					Sourdough fermentation is a common practice spread across the globe due to quality and shelf life improvement of baked goods. Above the widely studied exopolysaccharide (EPS) formation, which is exploited for structural improvements of foods including baked goods, beta-glucan formation, by using lactic acid bacteria (LAB), offers additional values. Through renunciation of sucrose addition for bacterial beta-d-glucan formation, which is required for the production of other homopolysaccharides, residual sweetness of baked goods can be avoided, and predicted prebiotic properties can be exploited. As promising starter cultures Levilactobacillus (L.) brevis TMW (Technische Mikrobiologie Weihenstephan) 1.2112 and Pediococcus (P.) claussenii TMW 2.340 produce O2-substituted (1,3)-beta-d-glucan upon fermenting wheat and rye doughs. In this study, we have evaluated methods for bacterial beta-glucan quantification, identified parameters influencing the beta-glucan yield in fermented sourdoughs, and evaluated the sourdough breads by an untrained sensory panel. An immunological method for the specific detection of beta-glucan proved to be suitable for its quantification, and changes in the fermentation temperature were related to higher beta-glucan yields in sourdoughs. The sensory analysis resulted in an overall acceptance of the wheat and rye sourdough breads fermented by L. brevis and P. claussenii with a preference of the L. brevis fermented wheat sourdough bread and tart-flavored rye sourdough bread. © 2021 by the authors.

Food & Function					Osteoarthritis (OA) is presently the most prevalent form of chronic degenerative joint disease, which is characterized by erosion of articular cartilage, subchondral bone sclerosis and synovitis. Accumulating evidence has revealed that 18beta-glycyrrhetinic acid (18beta-GA), a major bioactive component derived from Glycyrrhiza glabra, exerts anti-inflammatory effects on several diseases. However, the anti-inflammatory effects of 18beta-GA on OA remain undetermined. The present study aimed to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of 18beta-GA on chondrocytes and the therapeutic effects on destabilization of the medial meniscus destabilization (DMM) mouse models of OA. For the in vivo study, we randomly divided the mice into three groups: vehicle control (n = 15), sham (n = 15) and 18beta-GA (n = 15) groups, and treated them with similar doses (50 mg kg-1 day-1) of 18beta-GA or saline. Cartilage tissues were harvested from the mice for histological analyses eight weeks after operation. For the in vitro studies, mouse chondrocytes were administered with 10 ng mL-1 interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) after being treated with 18beta-GA at various concentrations. In vitro assays revealed that treatment with 18beta-GA considerably suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines, including prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nitric oxide (NO), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which were induced by IL-1beta. Furthermore, 18beta-GA decreased the expression of matrix-degrading proteases, including matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13) and A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5), in a concentration-dependent manner, which mediated extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation. 18beta-GA reversed aggrecan and type II collagen degradation. Furthermore, we observed that 18beta-GA significantly suppressed IL-1beta-induced nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation by activating the nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (Nrf2) /heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) pathway in vitro and in vivo. Experiments demonstrated that 18beta-GA might alleviate the progression of OA in the DMM mouse model in vivo. The findings demonstrate that 18beta-GA reduces inflammation induced by IL-1beta in chondrocytes. Therefore, 18beta-GA could be a potential therapeutic agent for OA. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	18	8399	8410	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01379c					FSTA:2022-01-Aj0364
J		Bodhika Khare; Veenu Sangwan; Varsha Rani							Influence of sprouting on proximate composition, dietary fiber, nutrient availability, antinutrient, and antioxidant activity of flaxseed varieties.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study evaluated the effect of sprouting on nutritional characteristics of flaxseed varieties Neelam, Garima, Shekhar, and Kusum. It was found that moisture and ash contents of sprouted flaxseeds were higher, while the crude protein, fat, and fiber content of sprouted flaxseeds were significantly lower than that of raw. The highest protein content among all the four raw and sprouted flaxseed varieties was in Neelam while lowest protein content was of Kusum variety. After sprouting of flaxseeds their soluble dietary fiber increased while insoluble dietary fiber decreased. There was less change in total calcium content even after germination as compared to raw. On mean basis, the total iron and magnesium contents of sprouted flaxseed varieties were significantly (p< 0.05) lower as compared to raw varieties. Sprouting caused increase in available mineral contents (calcium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and phosphorus), in vitro protein and starch digestibilities and antioxidant activity of processed flaxseeds. Practical applications. Flaxseeds are nutritious oilseeds being a rich source of dietary fibers (lignans), essential fatty acids, protein, minerals like iron, calcium, zinc, phosphorus, and magnesium and antioxidants which are important for human nutrition and development. Sprouting resulted in a decrease in anti-nutritional factor in flaxseeds thereby removing the toxic constituents present in flaxseeds and rendering them safe for human consumption. Sprouting is a very easy economical and efficient technique which can be followed at household level to obtain safe, pro-health, nutritionally, and functionally superior flaxseeds; which can be further utilized for product development, value addition, and combating nutritional deficiencies. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15344					FSTA:2021-08-Js10423
J		Bodjrenou, F. S. U.; Hounkpatin, W. A.; Termote, C.; Dato, G.; Savy, M.							Determining factors associated with breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in rural Southern Benin.		Food Science & Nutrition					This study aimed at characterizing breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices in a food-insecure area of Benin and identifying factors associated with these practices. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the districts of Bopa and Houeyogbe among n=360 mother-child pairs. Children aged 0-17 months were considered. Socioeconomic characteristics among children and mothers, Breastfeeding on demand, Breastfeeding frequency during children illness, and Positioning and Attachment of children while breastfeeding were assessed using semi-structured interviews and observations. Qualitative 24-hr recalls were administered to mothers to compute WHO recommended complementary feeding practices indicators namely minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF), and minimum acceptable diet (MAD) among 6-17 months old children (n=232). Associations between each feeding practice and mothers' socioeconomic characteristics were tested using multivariate generalized linear models. Breastfeeding on demand and good positioning and attachment for breastfeeding rates were 59% and 66%, respectively. Only 26% of mothers used to increase breastfeeding frequency when their children were ill. The proportions of children who met MDD, MMF, and MAD were 51%, 75%, and 44%, respectively. Children living in Houeyogbe were less likely to be breastfed on demand compared with those living in Bopa; however, they had better breastfeeding frequency during illness and meal frequency. Socioeconomic factors with significant association with breastfeeding practices were children age and sex and mothers' education, ethnicity, and employment status. Complementary feeding practices were positively associated with children's age but not with other socioeconomic characteristics. Breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices were almost suboptimal or medium and still need to be improved through well designed nutrition intervention program including nutrition education. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Bodor, K.; Bodor, Z.; Szep, A.; Szep, R.							Classification and hierarchical cluster analysis of principal Romanian bottled mineral waters.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In the present study, 53 Romanian origin and commercially available mineral water brands were collected from the market and analyzed based on the chemical, mineral content labeled by manufacturers. The selected chemical parameters were, from the cations: Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, from the anions: HCO3-, Cl-, SO42-, and fixed residue at 180 °C. The Spearman correlation showed that cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+) had a positive correlation of 0.90, 0.83 and 0.75 with HCO3-. The mineral content of bottled waters varied between a broad spectrum. According to the fixed residue, the distribution of low, medium, and rich mineralized water was 43.9%, 41.46% and 14.63%. Based on ion composition, mineral waters can be classified as bicarbonate-, calcium-, magnesium-sodium waters with 34%, 26.4%, 24.5% and 18.9%, respectively. From the Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) two different clusters and five sub-clusters were derided; the first had three mineral and bicarbonate degrees (1.1-low, 1.3-medium and 1.2-high), and the average Ca2+/Mg2+ ratios varied between 3.61-5.71. The mineral water brands with very high mineral and bicarbonate content belonged to cluster 2. The differences in the chemical composition of the bottled waters can be mainly attributed to the geological structure of the hydro-mineral basins, the post-volcanic activities and residence time as well.

J		Bodor, Z.; Benedek, C.; Urbin, A.; Szabo, D.; Sipos, L.							Colour of honey: can we trust the Pfund scale? - An alternative graphical tool covering the whole visible spectra.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Honey is popular and versatile nutraceutical product, widely used as a sweetener. Its sensory properties, determined by the botanical origin, play a high role in consumers" decision. Among these, colour is an important, often price-defining property. Colour evaluation of honey can be done by different ways, the most commonly known being the Pfund scale, but Lovibond scale or spectral analysis are used as well. The Pfund method provides a specific evaluation scale for honeys, however, this method is not able to detect slight differences and it also has some deficiencies. Our aim was to provide some examples proving the shortages of the present methodology for determination of honey colour and suggest a solution that could qualify as a possible standardized method. A template providing all the calculations (Pfund value, L* a* b*, C*ab, h°ab, DeltaE*ab, DeltaC*ab, Deltah*ab, DeltaH*ab, DeltaL*, Deltaa*, Deltab*) based on the UV-VIS transmission spectra, comparing the results of honey samples is attached. The experiment revealed the drawbacks of the Pfund scaling system. We provide an alternative analytical method that can deliver more details and information on honey colour and could overcome the deficiencies of the present protocols. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Identification of biomarkers in hydrosoluble extracts from spelt and wheat cultivated in different production systems.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In the present paper, a method for differentiation between common and spelt wheat grown in different farming systems (biodynamic, ecological, integrated, conventional), based on biomarkers identified from aqueous flour extracts (nitrogen and 14 soluble carbohydrates) was employed. Results. The identification and determination of soluble carbohydrate content were carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, with the UV spectrum generated by mass spectrometry for comparison with the WILEY database. Soluble carbohydrates were determined in the peak area between 21.92 and 43.63min-1 retention time. The obtained data set was analyzed by multivariate statistical techniques. It was revealed that common wheat exerted a much more pronounced tendency than spelt wheat to be influenced by the farming system. Conclusion. This differentiation was particularly well visualized after subjecting the data set to principal component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA). In the PCA graph, all spelt samples were positioned closer to the corresponding control sample, in contrast to the wheat samples, which were distributed over a huge area in the factor space. CA showed that the spelt samples grown under different farming systems were highly similar and grouped into one cluster. Common wheat samples cultivated under organic, biodynamic and integrated system were similar and represented the second cluster, whereas that cultivated under the conventional system was clearly separated from other samples. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Bodur, M.; Baspinar, B.; Ozcelik, A. A.							Do sleep quality and caffeine consumption mediate the relationship between late chronotype and body mass index?		Food & Function					Aim. To determine the role of sleep quality and caffeinated beverage consumption in the effect of late chronotype on body mass index (BMI). Materials and methods. The study consisted of a total of 661 healthy university students with a mean age of 21.41.38 years. Within the scope of the study, The Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire (MEQ) was used to determine the chronotypes of individuals, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to determine sleep quality, and a 24 h physical activity record was taken to determine physical activity levels. The caffeine intake of the individuals was determined using a food frequency questionnaire for the intake of caffeinated food and beverages. The role of mediators in the effect of late chronotype on BMI was evaluated via multiple mediation analysis. Results. In this study, evening-type individuals had higher daily caffeine intake, worse sleep quality (P< 0.001), and higher BMI (P< 0.05). When the effect of mediators was taken into account, the negative relationship between the chronotype score and BMI was maintained (beta =-0.109, 95% CI (-0.194, -0.021), P< 0.05). Decreased sleep quality had a mediated effect in this relationship [beta =-0.208, 95% CI (-0.275, -0.119)], and caffeinated beverage consumption was found to have no mediator function (beta=0.040 95% CI (-0.050, 0.108), P> 0.05). Conclusion. To conclude, eveningness chronotype had an effect on higher levels of caffeinated beverage consumption, lower sleep quality, and increased BMI. Chronotype, sleep quality, and caffeinated beverage consumption should be taken into account in studies examining the relationship between circadian rhythm and obesity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Bodur, S.; Erarpat, S.; Balcik, U.; Bakirdere, S.							A rapid, sensitive and accurate determination of cobalamin with double monitoring system: HPLC-UV and HPLC-ICP-OES.		Food Chemistry					This study proposed a novel analytical method for the separation and determination of cobalamin and cobalt in kefir samples by high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-OES) in addition to determination of cobalamin in HPLC system. Chromatographic parameters such as column type, buffer solution, mobile phase flow rate and sample injection volume were individually studied and optimized. In addition, cobalamin was simultaneously determined by high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection (HPLC-UV). LOD values of cobalt in cobalamin and cobalt for HPLC-ICP-OES system were calculated as 0.07 mg/kg (as Co) and 0.06 mg/kg, respectively. Recovery studies were conducted to evaluate the accuracy/applicability of the method. Recovery results for cobalt in cobalamin and cobalt detected by the HPLC-ICP-OES system were calculated in the range of 87.4-100.1 and 98.8-115.0%, respectively while recovery results for cobalamin were found to be between 89.2 and 98.3% for HPLC-UV system.

Foods					The substitution of animal protein with proteins of plant origin is a viable way to decrease the negative impact caused by animal husbandry on the environment. Pulse consumption has been widely promoted as a nutritious contribution to protein supplementation. In this study, an emulsion of lentil (Lens culinaris) protein isolate is fermented with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to manufacture a yoghurt alternative and the techno-functional properties compared to a dairy- and a soy-based product with similar protein contents. The yoghurt-like products are subjected to large and small deformation analysis, quantification of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP), water holding capacity tests, protein profile analysis and the gel structure is visualised by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The lentil yoghurt alternative shows good water holding capacity, high firmness and consistency values in large deformation analysis, with cohesiveness and viscosity not significantly different from that of dairy yoghurt. The high gel strength and rigidity of the lentil yoghurt gels measured by small deformation analysis is well-reflected in the dense protein matrix in the CLSM graphs. FODMAP content of the lentil yoghurt is very low, making it suitable for consumption by irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) patients. Our results show that lentil protein isolate is an excellent base material for producing a plant-based yoghurt alternative. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Boehme, B.; Bickhardt, A.; Rohm, H.							Pre-crystallization of nougat by seeding with cocoa butter crystals enhances the bloom stability of nougat pralines.		Foods					Fat bloom is an outstanding quality defect especially in filled chocolate, which usually comprises oils of different origins and with different physical properties. Dark chocolate pralines filled with nougat contain a significant amount of hazelnut oil in their center and have been reported as being notably susceptible to oil migration. The current study was designed to test the assumption that a targeted crystallization of nougat with cocoa butter seed crystals is an appropriate technological tool to reduce filling oil transfer to the outside of the praline and, hence, to counteract chocolate shell weakening and the development of fat bloom. For this purpose, the hardness of nougat/chocolate layer models and the thermal properties of chocolate on top of nougat were analyzed during storage at 23 °C for up to 84 days. Pronounced differences between layer models with seeded nougat and with control nougat that was traditionally tempered were observed. The facts that chocolate hardness increased rather than decreased during storage, that the cocoa butter melting peak was shifted towards a lower temperature, and that the hazelnut oil content in the chocolate was reduced can be taken as explicit indicators for the contribution of seeded nougat to the fat bloom stability of filled chocolate. © 2021 by the authors.

Antioxidant and antimicrobial effect of an innovative active film containing corn stigma residue extract for refrigerated meat conservation.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					A bioactive film based on gelatin and corn starch with corn stigma extract (CSE) was developed for application to protect the quality of chilled beef. The physical and functional properties of the films were evaluated. It was found that the incorporation of CSE did not affect the thickness and moisture of the films, but reduced the solubility in water. The opacity of the active films was slightly higher than that of the control film. The incorporation of the CSE extract in the films considerably increased the bioactive and antioxidant properties. The application of CSE reduced lipid oxidation by 60% compared with the control (without additive). It is important to emphasize that the pH values remained low until the 7th day of shelf life. The active film also showed antimicrobial activity against mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria. The overall results emphasized the potential use of bioactive compounds from the CSE for the production of films intended for food packaging. Practical applications. This study proved the antioxidant and antimicrobial action of corn stigma extract (CSE) incorporated in films to package refrigerated beef. The CSE demonstrated a strong antioxidant action, reducing lipid oxidation by 60% compared with the control, decreasing the count of mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria. The compiled results confirm that the active film containing CSE extract can be used as an alternative packaging. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15721					FSTA:2022-01-Sg0060

Food Chemistry					This study aimed at evaluating mitigation of nivalenol (NIV) in alcoholic fermentation with magnetic field application (MF). Mitigation was related to both the glutathione (GSH) redox molecule and the enzyme peroxidase (PO), which were synthesized by Saccharomyces cerevisiae US-05. Conditions under evaluation were NIV (0.2 g mL-1), MF application (35 mT) and simultaneous use of mycotoxin and MF. The GSH content and the PO activity were increased when the culture contained NIV and the alcohol profile was altered after 48 h of fermentation. At the end of the alcoholic fermentation, NIV was mitigated by 56.5%. Therefore, this process is a promising method to reduce contamination by NIV, although the mycotoxin affects the chemical characteristics of the final product. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Boekel, M. A. J. S. van							To pool or not to pool: that is the question in microbial kinetics.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Variation observed in heat inactivation of Salmonella strains (data from Combase) was characterized using multilevel modeling with two case studies. One study concerned repetitions at one temperature, the other concerned isothermal experiments at various temperatures. Multilevel models characterize variation at various levels and handle dependencies in the data. The Weibull model was applied using Bayesian regression. The research question was how parameters varied with experimental conditions and how data can best be analyzed: no pooling (each experiment analyzed separately), complete pooling (all data analyzed together) or partial pooling (connecting the experiments while allowing for variation between experiments). In the first case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions. While variation in the initial number parameter was low (set by the researchers), the Weibull shape factor varied for each repetition from 0.58-1.44, and the rate parameter from 0.006-0.074 h. With partial pooling variation was much less, with complete pooling variation was strongly underestimated. In the second case study, level 1 consisted of the measurements, level 2 of the group of repetitions per temperature experiment, level 3 of the cluster of various temperature experiments. The research question was how temperature affected the Weibull parameters. Variation in initial numbers was low (set by the researchers), the rate parameter was obviously affected by temperature, the estimate of the shape parameter depended on how the data were analyzed. With partial pooling, and one-step global modeling with a Bigelow-type model for the rate parameter, shape parameter variation was minimal. Model comparison based on prediction capacity of the various models was explored. The probability distribution of calculated decimal reduction times was much narrower using multilevel global modeling compared to the usual single level two-step approach. Multilevel modeling of microbial heat inactivation appears to be a suitable and powerful method to characterize and quantify variation at various levels. It handles possible dependencies in the data, and yields unbiased parameter estimates. The answer on the question "to pool or not to pool" depends on the goal of modeling, but if the goal is prediction, then partial pooling using multilevel modeling is the answer, provided that the experimental data allow that.

J		Boelsen-Robinson, T.; Blake, M. R.; Brown, A. D.; Huse, O.; Palermo, C.; George, N. A.; Peeters, A.							Mapping factors associated with a successful shift towards healthier food retail in community-based organisations: a systems approach.		Food Policy					Background. Food retailers in community settings are gatekeepers to the crucial food systems changes needed to improve population nutrition. Evidence-based models of change are needed to enable shifts in these complex retail environments. Systems thinking offers unique insights by capturing potential unintended consequences and multiple pathways to success. This study sought to create a systems map for retailers, public health practitioners and other stakeholders seeking to implement healthy food retail policies. It aimed to identify (i) points of intervention through which community-based organisations can shift to healthier food provision, and (ii) key feedback loops that could drive potential unintended consequences of such policies in a complex system. Methods. Semi-structured interviews (n=26) were conducted, from 2015 to 2018, across four community food retail settings where healthy food retail policies had been implemented in Victoria, Australia. Interviews were coded by identifying causal relationships and their direction between factors. Vensim software was used to merge interview results and then reduce the map to the strongest and most frequent factors and relationships. Illustrative implementation stories and points of intervention were identified. Findings The resulting map is titled the Systems Thinking Approach for Retail Transformation (START) map. Five prominent implementation stories incorporating 17 factors highlighted that: 1) retailer resistance to change is strongest in the beginning but decreases with the demonstration of favourable initiative outcomes; 2) successive changes tend to be increasingly complex, and therefore harder for retailers to implement; 3) organisational resourcing can be influenced through multiple pathways; 4) customer acceptability of healthy changes and retailers' willingness to engage in changes influence each other; and 5) challenges in accessing healthy supply options make retailers more resistant to implementing healthy changes. Conclusions. The application of systems thinking to the challenge of unhealthy food retail creates novel and practical insights for retailers and health promotion practitioners into what actions are most likely to promote healthy changes in complex retail environments.

J		Boer, J. de; Aiking, H.							Exploring food consumers' motivations to fight both climate change and biodiversity loss: combining insights from behavior theory and Eurobarometer data.		Food Quality and Preference					Using data from Eurobarometer 83.4, this study combines the two branches of research that address climate-related and biodiversity-related opinions and actions of individuals in the EU. The literature shows that the differences between climate-related and biodiversity-related policies correspond, at an individual level, to a person's basic attitudes towards environmental protection and towards nature protection, respectively. The contribution of this study is to demonstrate how these attitudes can influence behavior that has environmental repercussions for both issues, such as food consumption practices. The analysis focused on two Eurobarometer questions about buying local and seasonal food (to fight climate change) and about buying organic and local food (to protect biodiversity and nature). The results of two multinomial regression analyses, separately in Northwestern European countries and Eastern and Southern European countries, demonstrated that climate-related and biodiversity-related attitudes were, independent of each other, related to the adoption of these purchase behaviors. The results may support Europe's new Farm to Fork (F2F) strategy and indicate that improving food consumption practices can enable individuals to better play their part in fighting climate change and biodiversity loss simultaneously, which opens up interesting new perspectives for policymakers, businesses and consumers.

J		Boga, M.; Ozkan, E. E.; Ersoy, E.; Tuncay, E.; Canturk, Y. Y.; Cinar, E.; Kara, E. M.; Gokhan Zengin							Identification and quantification of phenolic and volatile constituents in five different Anatolian thyme species using LC-MS/MS and GC-MS, with biological activities.		Food Bioscience					Being widely used in the food industry, thyme is one of the most valuable plants in many aspects, and Turkey is one of the hotspots for thyme industry. Five thyme species, Thymus convolutus (endemic), Thymus fallax, Thymus haussknechtii Velen (endemic), Thymus kotschyanus var. kotschyanus, and Thymus sipyleus from Turkey were subjected in this study. Their essential oils and the extracts of aerial and root parts were obtained. GC-MS analyses showed that camphor was the major compound in T. convolutus (12.7%), and in T. sipyleus (13.1%) essential oils. The major volatile compound of T. fallax was bicyclogermacrene (21.5%), whereas the T. kotschyanus var. kotschyanus essential oil showed a predominance of carvacrol (48.5%), and thymol (22.5%). Carvacrol was also the major compound of T. haussknechtii with 28.2%. LC-MS/MS analyses showed that nicotiflorin (293.28-4201.15 mug/mL), caffeic (516.41-851.28 mug/mL), quinic (344.37-4410.94 mug/mL), rosmarinic (1800.18-9631.71 mug/mL), and fumaric acid (350.88-682.10 mug/mL) were detected as the main compounds in the extracts. All extracts exerted strong antioxidant activity, and the highest radical scavenging activity was demonstrated by T. haussknechtii root extract. T. convolutus and T. haussknechtii aerial parts extracts showed significant antimicrobial activity against C. tropicalis at MIC of 19.53 mug/mL . The extracts were found to be non-toxic against COLO205 and KM12 human colon, and UO-31, and A498 human renal cell lines. Their enzyme inhibitory activities were also evaluated against cholinesterase, tyrosinase and urease enzymes and T. fallax aerial part extract was the most effective with 34.480.60% in antibutyrylcholinesterase activity . These species with strong antioxidant and antifungal properties and no toxicity could be beneficial to be used as preservatives in the food processing industry.

J		Bogacz, A.; Stec, M.; Ramos, P.; Pilawa, B.							UV-irradiation influence on free radical formation and radical scavenging ability of caffeic acid-EPR, UV-Vis, and colorimetric examination.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, and colorimetric analysis, were used to examine nonirradiated and UV-irradiated caffeic acid. In this work free radical formation during UV-irradiation of caffeic acid and the effect of UV-irradiation on its radical scavenging ability, were studied. The influence of time of UV-irradiation on these problems was evaluated. EPR spectra of free radicals in caffeic acid and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylo-hydrazyl (DPPH) were measured. DPPH was used as the model free radical reference to test antioxidative properties of caffeic acid. Amplitudes, linewidths, integral intensities, and g-factors were analyzed. Free radical concentrations were determined by comparing of the EPR spectra of caffeic acid and ultramarine-the paramagnetic reference. Free radicals were found (~1018 spin/g) in all the UV-irradiated samples independent on irradiation time. Free radical concentrations in caffeic acid increased with increasing of irradiation time. Analysis of spectral shape for different microwave powers pointed out that free radicals system in UV-irradiated caffeic acid was complex. Nonirradiated and UV-irradiated caffeic acid as antioxidants strongly interacted with free radicals and EPR signals of DPPH were highly quenched. UV-irradiation increased interactions of caffeic acid with free radicals, and this effect increased with increasing of irradiation time. Practical Application. The performed studies indications that caffeic acid should not be storage exposed to UV. UV-irradiation formed free radicals in caffeic acid and changed its antioxidative properties as radical scavenging ability. Free radical concentrations in caffeic acid increased with increased UV irradiation time. UV-irradiation causes a change of color in caffeic acid. The change of color and formation of free radicals in caffeic acid during UV-irradiation can indicate the destruction of the chemical structure of tested samples. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Dairy Science					Heating, pressurization, and shearing can modify native milk proteins. The effects of pressurized heating (0.5 vs. 10 MPa at 75 or 95 °C) with shearing (1,000 s-1) on proteins of raw bovine skim milk (SM, ~9% total solids) and concentrated raw skim milk (CSM, ~22% total solids) was investigated. The effects of evaporative concentration at 55 °C and pressurized shearing (10 MPa, 1,000 s-1) at 20 °C were also examined. Evaporative concentration of SM resulted in destabilization of casein micelles and dissociation of alphaS1-and beta-casein, rendering CSM prone to further reactions. Treatment at 10 MPa and 1,000 s-1 at 20 °C caused substantial dissociation of alphaS1-and beta-casein in SM and CSM, with some dissociated caseins forming shear-induced soluble aggregates in CSM. The pressure applied at 10 MPa induced compression of the micelles and their dissociation in SM and CSM at 75 or 95 °C, resulting in reduction of the micelle size. However, 10 MPa did not alter the mineral balance or whey proteins denaturation largely, except by reduction of some beta-sheets and alpha-helices, due to heat-induced conformational changes at 75 and 95 °C.

J		Bogard, J. R.; Andrew, N. L.; Farrell, P.; Herrero, M.; Sharp, M. K.; Tutuo, J.							A typology of food environments in the pacific region and their relationship to diet quality in Solomon islands.		Foods					Extensive literature describes the importance of food environments (FEs) as a driver of food choices and nutrition outcomes; yet existing FE frameworks do not adequately capture the diversity of FEs relevant to the Pacific Region. This limits identification of opportunities in food systems to reduce the multiple burden of malnutrition. We present a conceptual typology of FEs including six primary FEs relevant in the Pacific; wild; cultivated; kin and community; informal retail; formal retail; and food aid and services. We then apply this typology to food acquisition data from Solomon Islands 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey and analyse the relationship between FEs and diet quality. The cultivated FE accounts for 60% of the quantity of food acquired nationally, followed by wild (15%), kin and community (9%), and formal and informal retail FEs (8% each), with wide variation between urban and rural households, provinces and wealth groups. Reliance on different FEs is a significant predictor of diet quality and affirms the importance of subsistence fisheries and agriculture, and community and kinship networks. Integration of a FE typology such as the one presented here in commonly conducted household expenditure surveys offers significant opportunity to advance our understanding of food system leverage points to improve nutrition and health. © 2021 by the authors.

Roasted coffee oil microencapsulation by spray drying and complex coacervation techniques: characteristics of the particles and sensory effect.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The objective of this research was to microencapsulate roasted coffee oil using spray drying (SD) and complex coacervation (CC) techniques and to compare the microparticles properties and their sensory impact on the perception of soluble coffee brew aroma. Starch was used as wall material for spray dried microparticles (MSD), and gelatin and gum Arabic for that produced by complex coacervation (MCC). Ultrasound stable emulsions were obtained. Both microparticles presented a continuous wall and similar glass transition temperature (49.3°C). MSD had 10.2% oil content and low surface oil content, and high solubility and wettability. MCC stood out for its high oil content (42.8%) and larger diameter (125 mum). Sensory evaluation showed that, when dissolved in hot water, microparticles provided a coffee aroma. Despite the MCC brew was preferred by assessors, the perception of coffee aroma intensity during the preparation of a soluble coffee brew containing MSD or MCC were similar.

J		Bogyoung Choi; Eunmi Koh							Effect of fruit thermal processing on ethyl carbamate content in maesil (Prunus mume) liqueur.		Food Science and Biotechnology					The thermal effect of maesil on the content of ethyl carbamate and its precursors during one-year ripening of maesil liqueur was investigated. Fresh maesil (control), fruit blanched for 2 min (blanched), and fruit blanched and dried for 15 h at 50°C (blanched/dried) were soaked in the liquor containing 25% alcohol at a ratio of 1:2 (w/w) for 100 days at 25°C and the liquid was further ripened for 260 days. Ethyl carbamate ranged from 13.1 to 204.4 mug/kg with the highest value at 210 day. Thermally treated samples had higher ethyl carbamate concentration than the control, suggesting that thermal treatment increased the formation of ethyl carbamate. A positive correlation between ethyl carbamate content and beta-glucosidase activity in all samples indicated that enzymatic hydrolysis of amygdalin by beta-glucosidase determined ethyl carbamate concentration during the fermentation of maesil liqueur. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.

J		Bohai Li; Fan Hui; Zhang Yuan; Qingxiang Shang; Guo Shuai; Yingshu Bao; Yongfu Chen							Untargeted fecal metabolomics revealed biochemical mechanisms of the blood lipid-lowering effect of koumiss treatment in patients with hyperlipidemia.		Journal of Functional Foods					Our previous study found that consuming koumiss daily could beneficially reduce the levels of blood lipids, but the exact mechanism is not clear. Thus, this work aimed to investigate the biochemical mechanism of lipid-lowering effect using untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). The fecal metabolomes of hyperlipidemia patients who consumed koumiss daily were analyzed before and after koumiss treatment. A total of ten significant differential metabolites (ursolic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid, alpha-tocotrienol, gamma-tocotrienol, alanine, tyrosine, sphingosine, acetate, and butyrate) were detected, and they all showed significant increased relative concentrations at days 30 and 60. Many of these metabolites were involved in lipid metabolism and transport. These results suggested that the ten identified metabolites were likely associated with the observed lipid-lowering effect. Finally, by using the Search Tool for Interactions of Chemicals (STITCH), metabolic networks connecting these metabolites were constructed to elucidate the biochemical mechanism of the hypolipidemic effect.

J		Bohan Liu; Ruixue Deng; Maoxin Yan; Shuai Zhang; Junpeng Yi; Pu Liu; Yanlong Zhang							Extraction, isolation and bioactivity of oligostilbenes from oil peony seed shells.		Food Bioscience					An efficient strategy for the extraction of total oligostilbenes extract (TOE) from oil peony seed shells was developed. The chemical constituents, the antimicrobial and antitumor activities of TOE were also measured. Based on the results, the optimum conditions were as follows: an ultrasonic extraction temperature of 64.0 °C, an ultrasonic extraction time of 25.0 min, a liquid-to-solid ratio of 25.0 mL/g, and an ethanol concentration of 66.0%. With these conditions, the extraction yield of TOE was 20.5%. Bioactivity assays showed that the TOE had varying degrees of antibacterial activity and strong antitumor activity in vitro. Twelve oligostilbenes were isolated from the TOE, and trans-gnetin H and suffruficosol B were the main compounds in the oil peony seed shells. These results suggested that the TOE from oil peony seed shells can be prepared as value-added products for their good antimicrobial and antitumor activities.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Myoglobin (MG) is one of the eukaryotic heme-binding proteins that is closely associated with the real color and metallic taste of meat and can be used as a color additive in artificial meat alternatives. However, the traditional extraction methods are expensive and time-consuming and the heterologous biosynthesis of MG has never been reported. Herein, we achieved the secretory expression of porcine MG by engineered Komagataella phaffii using the suitable host (X33), signal peptide (alpha-factor signal peptide), and modified constitutive promoter (G1 promoter). In addition, the fermentation conditions for MG production were optimized at shaking-flask level (BMGY medium with 40 mg/L of hemin, 30 °C) and at fermenter level (30% DO, feeding 150 mg/L of hemin), resulting in the highest titer of 285.42 mg/L MG in fed-batch fermentations. Furthermore, a purification method for food-grade MG was developed, which can obtain 0.22 mol of heme/mol of MG with 88.0% purity and 66.1% recovery rate.										2021	69	35	10235	10245	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04124					FSTA:2022-01-Bi0021
J		Bohlouli, M.; Yin, T.; Hammami, H.; Gengler, N.; Konig, S.							Climate sensitivity of milk production traits and milk fatty acids in genotyped Holstein dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					The aim of this study was the evaluation of climate sensitivity via genomic reaction norm models [i.e., to infer cow milk production and milk fatty acid (FA) responses on temperature-humidity index (THI) alterations]. Test-day milk traits were recorded between 2010 and 2016 from 5, 257 first-lactation genotyped Holstein dairy cows. The cows were kept in 16 large-scale cooperator herds, being daughters of 344 genotyped sires. The longitudinal data consisted of 47, 789 test-day records for the production traits milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), and protein yield (PY), and of 20, 742 test-day records for 6 FA including C16:0, C18:0, saturated fatty acids (SFA), unsaturated fatty acids (UFA), monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). After quality control of the genotypic data, 41, 057 SNP markers remained for genomic analyses. Meteorological data from the weather station in closest herd distance were used for the calculation of maximum hourly daily THI. Genomic reaction norm models were applied to estimate genetic parameters in a single-step approach for production traits and FA in dependency of THI at different lactation stages, and to evaluate the model stability. In a first evaluation strategy (New_sire), all phenotypic records from daughters of genotyped sires born after 2010 were masked, to mimic a validation population. In the second strategy (New_env), only daughter records of the new sires recorded in the most extreme THI classes were masked, aiming at predicting sire genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) under heat stress conditions. Model stability was the correlation between GEBV of the new sires in the reduced data set with respective GEBV estimated from all phenotypic data. Among all test-day production traits, PY responded as the most sensitive to heat stress. As observed for the remaining production traits, genetic variances were quite stable across THI, but genetic correlations between PY from temperate climates with PY from extreme THI classes dropped to 0.68. Genetic variances in dependency of THI were very similar for C16:0 and SFA, indicating marginal climatic sensitivity. In the early lactation stage, genetic variances for C18:0, MUFA, PUFA, and UFA were significantly larger in the extreme THI classes compared with the estimates under thermoneutral conditions. For C18:0 and MUFA, PUFA, and UFA in the middle THI classes, genetic correlations in same traits from the early and the later lactation stages were lower than 0.50, indicating strong days in milk influence. Interestingly, within lactation stages, genetic correlations for C18:0 and UFA recorded at low and high THI were quite large, indicating similar genetic mechanisms under stress conditions. The model stability was improved when applying the New_env instead of New_sire strategy, especially for FA in the first stage of lactation. Results. Indicate moderately accurate genomic predictions for milk traits in extreme THI classes when considering phenotypic data from a broad range of remaining THI. Phenotypically, thermal stress conditions contributed to an increase of UFA, suggesting value as a heat stress biomarker. Furthermore, the quite large genetic variances for UFA at high THI suggest the consideration of UFA in selection strategies for improved heat stress resistance. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Dairy Journal					The microbiological status of raw milk sold from vending stations at farm level in northern Germany was determined in relation to hygiene quality parameters and the presence of foodborne pathogens. For this, one hundred and ten samples were examined. The total viable count (TVC) was higher than 5 log cfu mL-1 in 36.4% of the milk samples. Counts of Pseudomonas spp., Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts and moulds were detected at mean values of 3.91.3 log cfu mL-1, 2.71.2 log cfu mL-1, 3.10.9 log cfu mL-1 and 1.50.8 log cfu mL-1, respectively. Overall, only 43% of the raw milk samples were of satisfactory quality from a microbiological point of view. Campylobacter jejuni and Arcobacter butzleri were determined in the enrichment broth of three raw milk samples. A long-term monitoring of three farms revealed that individual differences in farm management practice influenced raw milk quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Rumen bacteria play a critical role in feed degradation and productivity. This study evaluated the impact of feeding regimen on the rumen microbial populations and fatty acid composition of the meat of sheep. Twenty-four Sunit sheep were raised on a grass pasture from birth to 9 months of age, at which time they were randomly divided into two feeding groups: pasture feeding (PF) and barn feeding (BF). Sheep in the PF group were allowed to graze freely on wild grassland for 3 months. Sheep in the BF group were confined for 3 months to a dry barn, in which they roamed freely with corn straw and corn. Results. Sheep in the PF group had greater rumen bacteria diversity. The relative abundances of the genera Butyrivibrio_2, Saccharofermentans and Succiniclasticum were increased, and that of the genus RC9_gut_group was decreased, in the PF compared to the BF sheep. The n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid contents were greater in meat from PF sheep than from BF sheep. In addition, the alpha-linolenic acid (C18:3 n-3, ALA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) contents were positively correlated with the abundance of Butyrivibrio_2.Conclusion. Grazing may improve the diversity of rumen bacteria and increase the proportion of ALA and CLA in sheep meat. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	3	1100	1110	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10720					FSTA:2021-05-Sl2679

Meat Science					Understanding the priorities of beef consumers is important for planning strategies to attract and maintain each customer. Using self-administered interviews with Spanish and Brazilian adults who regularly consume beef, we analyzed their purchasing behaviors in relation to their perceptions and priorities regarding beef quality that guide their choices. The current study identifies the influences of information (labeling and marketing) requirements, concerns about humane production systems, and the intrinsic characteristics of beef. To evaluate the data extracted from the interviews, the questions were grouped into four main factors. While extrinsic factors are the highest valued in both Spain and Brazil, those such as beef freshness and tenderness present inverse concerns between the two countries based on cultural dissimilarities. The data also reveals a clear symmetry among consumers who increasingly seek specific pre-purchase information and products with guaranteed superior quality. Despite other characteristics that differentiate developed and developing countries, the perceptions of quality among consumers in Spain and Brazil are decidedly similar.

The synergic interaction between environmental factors (pH and NaCl) and the physiological state (vegetative cells and spores) provides new possibilities for optimizing processes to manage risk of C. sporogenes spoilage.		Food Microbiology					Clostridium sporogenes has been widely used as a surrogate for proteolytic C. botulinum for validating thermal processes in low-acid cans. To limit the intensity of heat treatments, industrials must use other ways of control as an association of acidic and saline environment after a low heat treatment. The probability of growth of pH (7-4.4), sodium chloride concentration (0-11%) and heat treatment (80 °C-10 min; 100 °C-1.5 min and 5.2 min) were studied on C. sporogenes PA 3679 spores and vegetative cells. Vegetative cells or heat-treated spores were inoculated in PYGm broth at 30 °C for 48 days in anaerobic conditions. Vegetative cells growth (pH 4.6-pH 4.5; 7%-8% NaCl) range is larger than the spore one (pH 5.2-pH 5.0; 6%-7% NaCl). Spores germination and outgrowth rage is decreased if the spores are heat-treated at 100 °C for 1.5 min (pH 5.5-5.3; 4%-5% NaCl) and 5.2 min (pH 5.7-5.3; 4%-5% NaCl). The C. sporogenes PA 3679 spores germination and outgrowth is impacted by their physiological state.

Effect of metabolaid on pre- and stage 1 hypertensive patients: a randomized controlled trial.		Journal of Functional Foods					Many patients with stage 1 hypertension have difficulties to achieve lifestyle changes to avoid the progression of the disease. The use of natural alternatives with demonstrated blood pressure-regulating properties is instrumental at this stage, avoiding the side effects found in some pharmaceutical drugs. In this context, previous studies have indicated the possibility that a botanical nutraceutical product based on the combination of Lippia citriodora and Hibiscus sabdariffa extracts has hypotensive properties in overweight and obese individuals. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the antihypertensive properties of this dietary supplement, as well as the effect on anthropometric and circulating parameters in pre-hypertensive and early stage 1 hypertensive patients (n = 84). The nutraceutical product, rich in polyphenolic compounds, has been assessed in a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with pre-hypertensive and early stage 1 hypertensive (non-medicated) individuals. Participants consumed early in the morning in fasting conditions 2 capsules/day containing each one 250 mg of the polyphenolic extracts. Anthropometric and blood parameters as well as punctual and continuous blood pressure monitoring were determined in placebo and experimental groups. As a result and compared to baseline values, volunteers showed a significant reduction of average daily systolic/diastolic blood pressure as well as in daytime diastolic/systolic, nighttime diastolic blood pressure and in% dipper. Intergroup analysis revealed that the consumption of the plant extract resulted in a significant reduction of body fat content (-1.26%; p < 0.05) and nocturnal systolic blood pressure (-16.60 mmHg; p < 0.05) as well as an improvement of the dipper status (3.18%; p < 0.01). In conclusion, these results suggest that the nutraceutical acts as a main regulator of the individual's blood pressure towards healthier values, and therefore may be useful for pre-hypertensive/pre-medicated individuals.

Food Chemistry					In the present research, seven different cornelian cherry (Cornus mas L.) cultivars and selections were examined. In vitro and in silico methods were applied for determining and correlating phytochemical constituents and biological potential. Loganic acid, cornuside, cyanidin 3-galactoside, and pelargonidin 3-galactoside were determined as the most dominant compounds, presenting ≥90% of the all detected iridoid and phenolic constituents in the extracts. Cornelian cherry fruits were characterized by high antioxidant capacity and antiproliferative activity on human colon cancer cells (HT29). It was observed the strong inhibitory potential of alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP III) enzyme activities. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used as a very helpful tool to discriminate the constituents with the highest contribution to tested bioactivities and to highlight the most potent genotypes. PCA, together with binding energies measurements and docking analysis, pointed out pelargonidin 3-robinobioside as the strongest inhibitor of alpha-glucosidase.

J		Bojnanska, T.; Musilova, J.; Vollmannova, A.							Effects of adding legume flours on the rheological and breadmaking properties of dough.		Foods					The influence of the addition of four legume flours, chickpea, broad bean, common bean and red lentil (in amounts of 5%, 10% and 15% to a wheat-rye composite flour (50:50:0-control flour), in ratios of 50:45:5; 50:40:10; 50:35:15) was studied by analyzing the rheological properties of dough in order to further exploit the functionality of legume flours in bakery products. The rheological properties of dough were monitored using a Mixolab 2. A Rheofermentometer F4 was used to check the dough fermentation, and a Volscan was used for evaluating the baking trials. The addition of different legume flours in the mixtures resulted in different viscoelastic properties of the dough. The results showed a weakening of the protein network depending on the amount of legume flour added and on the specific legume flour. On the contrary, all samples with a higher proportion of legume flour showed an increased resistance to starch retrogradation. All flours had the ability to produce a sufficient volume of fermenting gases, with the exception of flours with a higher addition of broad bean flour, and the baking test confirmed a lower bread volume for bread with this addition. The results of the sensory evaluation indicated that legume flour additions resulted in breads with an acceptable sensory quality, in the case of additions of 5% at the same level as the bread controls, or even better. The aromas and flavors of the added non-cereal ingredients improved the sensory profile of wheat-rye bread.

Microbial interactions between amylolytic and non-amylolytic lactic acid bacteria strains isolated during the fermentation of Pozol.		Foods					Pozol is a Mexican beverage prepared from fermented nixtamalized maize dough. To contribute to understanding its complex microbial ecology, the effect of inoculating on MRS-starch pure and mixed cultures of amylolytic Sii-25124 and non-amylolytic W. confusa 17, isolated from pozol, were studied on their interactions and fermentation parameters. These were compared with L. plantarum A6, an amylolytic strain isolated from cassava. Microbial growth, kinetic parameters, amylolytic activity, lactic acid production, and hydrolysis products from starch fermentation were measured. The population dynamics were followed by qPCR. L. plantarum A6 showed higher enzymatic activity, lactic acid, biomass production, and kinetic parameters than pozol LAB in pure cultures. Mixed culture of each pozol LAB with L. plantarum A6 showed a significant decrease in amylolytic activity, lactic acid yield, specific growth rate, and specific rate of amylase production. The interaction between Sii-25124 and W. confusa 17 increased the global maximum specific growth rate (), the lactic acid yield from starch (Ylac/s), lactic acid yield from biomass (Ylac/x), and specific rate of lactic acid production (qlac) by 15, 30, 30, and 40%, respectively, compared with the pure culture of Sii-25124. Interactions between the two strains are essential for this fermentation. © 2021 by the authors.

Food loss and waste actions: experiences of the Costa Rican food loss and waste reduction network.		Foods					Food Loss and Waste (FLW) reduction and prevention can be crucial entry points to achieve sustainable food systems. However, the complexity of this problem poses the need for multistakeholder and multidimensional approaches. The Costa Rican FLW Reduction Network has been working since 2014 as a collaborative platform that brings together different sectors and disciplines to promote a change through communication and awareness, alliances, and research and innovation. The purpose of our study was to share the experience of Costa Rica in regards to the applied FLW actions and its catalytic effect on FLW innovation. The study was developed through a multimethod approach that included case studies, stakeholder analysis and literacy analysis to provide an overall assessment of the strategy as input for further efforts in this matter. The main findings indicate that collaborative actions among institutions and sectors are vital in promoting FLW reduction; however, FLW innovation is still at an inception phase where financial resources and policy barriers remain as aspects to address. In conclusion, the Costa Rica FLW Network represents an asset to trigger ongoing and future actions, and approaches like an integrated innovation ecosystem must be promoted. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bolbocean, C.; Tylavsky, F. A.							The impact of safety net programs on early-life developmental outcomes.		Food Policy					Existing scholarly evidence suggests that early-life environments play a critical role in shaping an individual's long-term socioeconomic outcomes. The impact of safety net programs on early-life environments and outcomes is largely unknown. This study uses novel data to estimate the impact of the Women, Infants and Children (WIC), the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and home visitation (HV) programs on cognitive and language outcomes in children up to 24 months. Repeated measurements on participation in public programs and early-life outcomes for a large sample of children and mothers in Memphis, Shelby county, TN were collected. Within this dataset the exposure-outcome relationship is directly observable over time. The specific structure of the data enables us to address endogeneity concerns via the use of first-difference estimators combined with a rich set of time-varying covariates. We provide empirical evidence to conclude that WIC participation is associated with a positive and statistically significant impact of 0.32 and 0.16 standard deviations in receptive communication and expressive communication scores. Overall, participation in these safety net programs is shown to have meaningfully contributed to improving developmental outcomes among children up to two years of age. Presented empirical evidence might be critical at a time when funding for WIC, SNAP or other safety-net programs is in peril.

Digestive n-6 lipid oxidation, a key trigger of vascular dysfunction and atherosclerosis in the western diet: protective effects of apple polyphenols.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. A main risk factor of atherosclerosis is a Western diet (WD) rich in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) sensitive to oxidation. Their oxidation can be initiated by heme iron of red meat leading to the formation of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), a cytotoxic aldehyde. An increased 4-HNE production is implicated in endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. By contrast, a diet rich in proanthocyanidins reduces oxidative stress and arterial diseases. This study evaluates the effects of a WD on vascular integrity in ApolipoproteinE (ApoE-/-) mice and the protective capacity of apple extract and puree rich in antioxidant proanthocyanidins. Methods and results. ApoE-/- mice are fed during 12 weeks with a WD with or without n-6 PUFAs. Moreover, two WD+ n-6 PUFAs groups are supplemented with apple puree or phenolic extract. An increase in digestive 4-HNE production associated with a rise in plasmatic 4-HNE and oxidized LDL concentrations is reported. Oxidizable n-6 PUFAs consumption is associated with a worsened endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. Interestingly, supplementations with apple polyphenol extract or puree prevented these impairments while reducing oxidative stress. Conclusion. N-6 lipid oxidation during digestion may be a key factor of vascular impairments. Nevertheless, an antioxidant strategy can limit 4-HNE formation during digestion and thus durably protect vascular function. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Bolei Yang; Li Li; Hairong Geng; Chenxi Zhang; Gang Wang; Shuo Yang; Sheng Gao; Yueju Zhao; Fuguo Xing							Inhibitory effect of allyl and benzyl isothiocyanates on ochratoxin a producing fungi in grape and maize.		Food Microbiology					The purpose of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) and benzyl-isothiocyanate (BITC) on fungal growth and Ochratoxin A (OTA) production by Aspergillus ochraceus, A. carbonarius and A. niger. Here, we found that spore germination and fungal growth of the three fungi were significantly inhibited when the concentration of AITC and BITC was higher than 1.25 mug/mL. The inhibitory effect of AITC or BITC on A. carbonaceus and A. ochraceus was significantly stronger than that of A. niger. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the mycelia of all three fungi were changed by AITC and BITC. Compared with A. ochraceus and A. carbonarius, the damage to A. niger was lower. For OTA production, AITC and BITC could significantly down-regulated the expression of all five OTA biosynthesis genes in A. niger and A. carbonarius. In A. ochraceus, although several OTA biosynthesis genes were up-regulated, the key PKS gene was down-regulated by AITC and BITC. Twenty-five mug/mL of AITC or BITC could reduce the infection of the three fungi on grapes with inhibition rates of 28%-36% during 14 days and prolong the shelf life of grapes. In maize, the OTA production of the three fungi was significantly reduced by 25 mug/mL of AITC and BITC with the inhibition rates 68.04%-93.49% and 65.87%-75.45%, respectively. These results suggest that AITC and BITC can be used as natural fungicides to prevent A. niger, A. carbonarius and A. ochraceus from infecting grapes and maize and control OTA contamination.

J		Bolek, S.							Food purchasing, preservation, and eating behavior during COVID-19 pandemic: a consumer analysis.		Italian Journal of Food Science					Due to the highly infectious virus known as COVID-19 impacting the lives of the populace, more than any other event in recent memory, there is a pandemic in the world. In order to determine food purchasing behavior and eating habits, food preservation techniques and source of knowledge about COVID-19,992 consumers living in Istanbul, the most populous city in Turkey, were surveyed. The questionnaire was disseminated to participants via an online platform. Thirty questions, including the demographics of participants, changes in purchasing behavior, knowledge, and attitudes about food preservation techniques, changes in eating habits, and source of knowledge about COVID-19, were asked. The results of this study surveyed that COVID-19 has changed food purchasing and eating habits of Turkish consumers significantly (p< 0.05). During the survey in late March of 2020 and late December of 2020, about 65% of respondents have tried to consume more food that boost the immune system and 58% of the respondents have been more willing to buy fresh products. Consumers have greatly adopted preserving of food stuffs by freezing during quarantine days. This survey revealed that the effective use of media tools could increase awareness and lead to behavioral changes that can reduce the spread of COVID-19, especially in consumers aged over 65 years.										2021	33	3	14	24	1120-1770				10.15586/ijfs.v33i3.2048					FSTA:2022-10-Ja13314
J		Bolek, S.							Effects of waste fig seed powder on quality as an innovative ingredient in biscuit formulation.		Journal of Food Science					Being a rich source of antioxidants, phenolic compounds and dietary fiber, the fig seed could be valuable health-promoting food ingredient. The possibility of using fig seed powder in biscuits was investigated. For this purpose, wheat flour was replaced by fig seed powder at levels of 0, 5, 10, and 15%. The effects of replacement on proximate composition, color values, total phenolic contents, antioxidant activity, textural characteristics, and sensorial properties of biscuit samples were investigated. The composition of fig seed powder showed a significantly higher concentration of fiber (56.60.27%), protein (14.320.21%), fat (20.320.32%), and total phenolic content (665.120.52 mg GAE/100 g). The biscuit samples were obtained with increased fiber content by adding fig seed powder to the biscuit formulation. Moreover, fig seed powder increased the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of biscuits significantly (P< 0.05). The addition of fig seed powder to the biscuit formulation up to 10% increased the sensory scores of the biscuits in terms of odor, flavor, and overall impression. Practical Application. The use of waste products in food industry is relevant in terms of the circular economy context. The enrichment of biscuit with waste fig seed powder could also supplies accessional channel for valorization of a food waste. Fig seed powder could be used to produce acceptable biscuits with improved nutritional quality. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Bolenz, S.; Glode, L.							Technological and nutritional aspects of milk chocolate enriched with grape pomace products.		European Food Research and Technology					The French paradox is the observation of low heart disease death rates despite high intake of cholesterol and saturated fat, possibly related to the consumption of red wine containing polyphenols. Those are also found in pomace and affect health as radical catchers inhibiting cancer, inflammations and arteriosclerosis. European cocoa regulation allows incorporating up to 40% of added foodstuffs into chocolate, so grape pomace can be used. Cocoa itself is known as a very good source of phenolic compounds, and consequently dark chocolate is considered to have similar health benefits as red wine. Milk chocolates contain only little fat-free cocoa dry matter; therefore, grape pomace is considered most beneficial here. Entire pomace or flour from seeds have been tested to evaluate technical aspects as well as the impact on chocolate properties like particle size distribution, flow properties, total phenol content, antioxidative capacity and sensory perception. Initial trials revealed that additional drying and also pre-grinding was necessary before pomace can be used as an ingredient. Various samples were produced by the coarse conching process, which uses a ball mill for size reduction below 30 m. A difficulty arises when some tough particles slip through without being properly ground; D99-values can be used to better control this issue. Grape pomace contains almost as many polyphenols as cocoa liquor, so it can serve as a substitute. Its content and thus quality depends on gentle drying. Finally, adding, e.g., just 3.5% was able to significantly increase the polyphenol contents of milk chocolate. ©The Author(s) 2020.										2021	247	3	623	636	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-020-03651-4					FSTA:2021-06-Ka0496

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The high sucrose content in sweet bakery products is a nutritional concern. However, the technological functions of sucrose in such products make its replacement challenging. D-allulose, which only has 5% of the energy content of sucrose, may be an ideal sucrose substitute, due to its similar physicochemical and bulk properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of d-allulose as the main sugar component in cupcakes, in comparison to both sucrose and d-fructose, by assessing the physicochemical and physical properties of cupcakes baked for 12, 16, and 20 min. D-allulose batters experienced less volume expansion and took longer to lose weight and thermally set during baking than did sucrose batters. D-allulose cupcakes had lower water activity values at all baking times and developed a browner colour and greater acrylamide concentration, compared to sucrose cupcakes. Comparable textural properties were achieved by d-allulose and sucrose cupcakes at the longest baking time (20 min). D-allulose and d-fructose produced cupcakes with comparable physical properties. There is potential for the use of d-allulose in the bakery products industry, by employing longer baking processes, or in other products requiring lower moisture content and less volume development.

J		Bolin Mou; Yuanyuan Liu; Wenqing Yang; Shuang Song; Cai Shen; Oi-Ming Lai; Chin-Ping Tan; Ling-Zhi Cheong							Effects of dairy processing on phospholipidome, in-vitro digestion and Caco-2 cellular uptake of bovine milk.		Food Chemistry					Present work investigated the effects of processing (homogenization, sterilization) and cold storage on physicochemical properties, in vitro digestion and Caco-2 cellular uptake of bovine milk. Extreme heat sterilization and low temperature storage have significant impact on particle size and phospholipidome of bovine milk. In addition, cold storage of bovine milks led to formation of beta' polymorphs crystals and endothermic peak with Toffset higher than body temperature. Processing and cold storage also increased the initial digestibility but reduced the overall digestibility of bovine milk. This might be related to the decreased particle size of the milk fat globules, changed in the phospholipidome of the MFGM and formation of beta' polymorphs crystals in frozen milk. It is interesting to note that PE has relatively faster digestion meanwhile SM has relatively slower digestion. HTST milk which demonstrated lesser changed in terms of phospholipidome demonstrated highest cellular uptakes of most fatty acids.

Quantifying the bioprotective effect of Lactobacillus sakei CTC494 against Listeria monocytogenes on vacuum packaged hot-smoked sea bream.		Food Microbiology					In this study, the bioprotective potential of Lactobacillus sakei CTC494 against Listeria monocytogenes CTC1034 was evaluated on vacuum packaged hot-smoked sea bream at 5°C and dynamic temperatures ranging from 3 to 12°C. The capacity of three microbial competition interaction models to describe the inhibitory effect of L. sakei CTC494 on L. monocytogenes was assessed based on the Jameson effect and Lotka-Volterra approaches. A sensory analysis was performed to evaluate the spoiling capacity of L. sakei CTC494 on the smoked fish product at 5°C. Based on the sensory results, the bioprotection strategy against the pathogen was established by inoculating the product at a 1:2 ratio (pathogen:bioprotector, log CFU/g). The kinetic growth parameters of both microorganisms were estimated in monoculture at constant storage (5°C). In addition, the inhibition function parameters of the tested interaction models were estimated in co-culture at constant and dynamic temperature storage using as input the monoculture kinetic parameters. The growth potential (delta log) of L. monocytogenes, in mono-culture, was 3.5 log on smoked sea bream during the experimental period (20 days). In co-culture, L. sakei CTC494 significantly reduced the capability of L. monocytogenes to grow, although its effectiveness was temperature dependent. The LAB strain limited the growth of the pathogen under storage at 5 °C (<1 log increase) and at dynamic profile 2 (<2 log increase). Besides, under storage at dynamic profile 1, the growth of L. monocytogenes was inhibited (<0.5 log increase). These results confirmed the efficacy of L. sakei CTC494 for controlling the pathogen growth on the studied fish product. The Lotka-Volterra competition model showed slightly better fit to the observed L. monocytogenes growth response than the Jameson-based models according to the statistical performance. The proposed modelling approach could support the assessment and establishment of bioprotective culture-based strategies aimed at reducing the risk of listeriosis linked to the consumption of RTE hot-smoked sea bream.

A new expanded modelling approach for investigating the bioprotective capacity of Latilactobacillus sakei CTC494 against Listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat fish products.		Food Research International					Understanding the role of food-related factors on the efficacy of protective cultures is essential to attain optimal results for developing biopreservation-based strategies. The aim of this work was to assess and model growth of Latilactobacillus sakei CTC494 and Listeria monocytogenes CTC1034, and their interaction, in two different ready-to-eat fish products (i.e., surimi-based product and tuna pate) at 2 and 12°C. The existing expanded Jameson-effect and a new expanded Jameson-effect model proposed in this study were evaluated to quantitatively describe the effect of microbial interaction. The inhibiting effect of the selected lactic acid bacteria strain on the pathogen growth was product dependent. In surimi product, a reduction of lag time of both strains was observed when growing in coculture at 2°C, followed by the inhibition of the pathogen when the bioprotective L. sakei CTC494 reached the maximum population density, suggesting a mutualism-antagonism continuum phenomenon between populations. In tuna pate, L. sakei CTC494 exerted a strong inhibition of L. monocytogenes at 2°C (<0.5 log increase) and limited the growth at 12°C (<2 log increase). The goodness-of-fit indexes indicated that the new expanded Jameson-effect model performed better and appropriately described the different competition patterns observed in the tested fish products. The proposed expanded competition model allowed for description of not only antagonistic but also mutualism-based interactions based on their influence on lag time. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bolivar, F.							Simultaneous sugar cooling and drying in a retrofitted and upgraded granulator.		International Sugar Journal					Simultaneous sugar cooling and drying in a retrofitted and upgraded granulator. Using the drying step, the obvious goals are to consistently produce sugar of the desired moisture content and temperature. Our subtle goal is to prolong the drying step within the dryer to allow the greatest opportunity for crystallization of sucrose within the film around each crystal. The main objective into define the best path to achieve the sugar production capacity and correct output conditions for the sugar within the budget and location constraints. Michigan Sugar Company - at its Caro facility needed to increase production and the bottle neck was the existing Hersey granulator (1911) model. Non desired sugar outlet conditions in terms of moisture content and temperature had been an ongoing problem for CARO with reviews previously undertaken to determine the root cause. A decommissioned (1977) Sterns Roger Cooler Drum was therefore considered as a replacement by retrofitting and upgrading to a Modern Sugar Dryer-Cooler system. This paper describes the modifications to convert the cooler to a fully counter-current sugar dryer-cooler system together with control to significantly reduce the tendency for sugar of higher moisture content and temperature and provides initial performance results and energy savings compared with the original system.

J		Bollom, M. A.; Clark, S.; Acevedo, N. C.							Edible lecithin, stearic acid, and whey protein bigels enhance survival of probiotics during in vitro digestion.		Food Bioscience					Bigels are materials with semi-solid organic and aqueous phases and, therefore, have the potential to deliver both lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds to humans. Additionally, because bigels are two-phase systems, a diverse array of synthesis options are possible, allowing many unique characteristics to be achieved. The purpose of this study was two-fold: to assess the ability of bigels to protect probiotics during in vitro digestion in a simulated gastrointestinal system and to determine the effect of phospholipids on probiotic survival. A standardized COST INFOGEST Network in vitro digestion system was used, and survival of Bifidobacterium lactis and Lactobacillus acidophilus was measured. By measuring the increase in free fatty acids, the enzymes' lipolytic activity was confirmed. A control, with no gelators, had the greatest lipolysis. The formulated bigel was effective at protecting probiotics from the harsh conditions of the digestive tract compared to the control. L. acidophilus was more resistant to high shear conditions than B. lactis during gel preparation. Probiotics in bigels with phospholipids had greater survival during digestion; nonetheless, the difference was not statistically significant. It was hypothesized that this was due to the phospholipids being enzymatically broken down in the in vitro system. Therefore, for phospholipids to have a beneficial impact on probiotic survival, they must be in their native form. Overall, this study showed the potential of bigels to efficiently protect probiotics during digestion. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bolona, P. S.; Reinemann, D. J.; Upton, J.							Increasing the teatcup removal settings of the last milking quarter did not reduce box time in a pasture-based automatic milking system.		Journal of Dairy Science					This research followed our previous experimental and simulation work on the effect of different teatcup removal settings based on the rolling average milk flowrate and on milking duration at the quarter and udder levels. The aims of this experiment were to (1) quantify the differences in quarter milking duration in a pasture-based automatic milking system and (2) test the effect of increasing the milk flowrate at which teatcups are removed on the last milking quarter on udder milking duration, box time, milk production rate, and somatic cell count (SCC). Milking duration is an important component of efficiency and profitability in conventional and automatic milking systems. Additionally, quarters within an udder have significantly different milk yields and milking durations. This study used data from April to May 2018 of a pasture-based automatic milking system to evaluate quarter milking duration differences between quarters of an udder. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluated the use of 2 percentage-based teatcup removal settings applied to the last milking quarter (i.e., the last quarter with a teatcup still attached) on milking duration, box time, milk production rate, and SCC. The teatcup removal settings were at 30 or 50% of the last quarter's rolling average milk flowrate, while the other quarters remained at the 30% level. The selection of the quarter that would receive the more aggressive teatcup removal setting was determined by identifying the last quarter with a teatcup attached in every milking. Sixty-nine cows were divided into 2 groups that each received 1 of the 2 treatments for a 1-wk period and then switched to the other treatment for a second week. For the months of April and May 2018, quarter milking duration was significantly different between the quarter with the longest and the second longest milking duration within an udder. The quarter with the longest milking duration was milked on average 49 s longer than the quarter with second longest milking duration. However, in 36% of the milkings, the quarter with the longest milking duration was different from that of the previous milking. In the experimental part of this study, we saw no differences in milking duration, box time, milk production rate, or SCC between the 30 and 50% teatcup removal setting applied to the last milking quarter. Further research on using a variation of this percentage-based setting to target the quarter with the average longest milking duration or using an absolute milk flowrate switch-point or a maximum milking duration setting on the last quarter for reducing cow milking duration and box time is warranted.

J		Bolos, L. A.; Lagerkvist, C. J.; Normann, A.; Wendin, K.							In the eye of the beholder: expected and actual liking for apples with visual imperfections.		Food Quality and Preference					Food appearance is an important determinant for expected and actual liking, but some food is not even available for purchase due to visual imperfections. In two studies conducted with 130 participants in Sweden, we measured consumers" expected and actual liking for different apples with three types of visual imperfection (color, shape and damage). We investigated the effects of apples" visual characteristics on expected liking and whether or not this relationship is mediated by emotions and attitudes. Secondly, we investigated how actual liking differed between the groups of apples, and how it differed from expected liking. Results indicated that attitudes are the strongest mediator between visual characteristics of apples and expected liking. Moreover, participants indicated higher expected liking for color and shape imperfections relative to damaged apples. Results from the second study indicated a significant difference between expected and actual liking, and less variability in actual liking between the apple groups relative to the variability in expected liking. It can be concluded that the visual characteristics of apples influence both expected and actual liking, the practical implication for retailers being a need to carefully distinguish between the different types of visual sub-optimality and to keep the products that have a higher chance to be chosen (sub-optimal in shape and colour). Thus, these results generate a clearer understanding of visual sub-optimality, and can be incorporated in strategies for reducing food waste in stores.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Fresh-cut leafy greens are washed in water with antimicrobials such as free chlorine to mitigate risk of pathogen cross-contamination. Validation of the process in a commercial setting poses challenges, including the identification of effective surrogates that can be used directly on the processing line during commercial operation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an abiotic, DNA-based indicator as a potential surrogate for Escherichia coli O157:H7 during the washing of spinach. E. coli O157:H7 and DBAS (DNA barcode abiotic surrogate) were inoculated onto spinach leaves and washed in water with free chlorine. E. coli O157:H7 and DBAS populations were enumerated by selective plate counting or qPCR, respectively, and by laser scanning confocal microscopy. DBAS displayed high sensitivity to free chlorine at concentrations ≥12.5 mg/L, similar to concentrations commonly used in leafy green washing. Linear regression analysis indicated that inactivation of E. coli O157:H7 and DBAS had comparable inactivation responses (R2=0.76). Microscopy analysis also showed similar rates of decontamination between the two analytes from the surface of spinach. These results show that DBAS is a promising abiotic surrogate for onsite validation of antimicrobial processes targeting foodborne pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 on fresh produce.

Food Bioscience					Chewing gums can act as a drug delivery system due to their long duration in the oral cavity. In this study, 26 sugary and sugar-free propolis added chewing gums were produced, and a D-optimal mixture design was used to optimize the amount of components based on the responses (texture, and sensory parameters). It was found that a high amount of propolis (10%) had a negative effect on sensory and textural properties of the samples, however, 5.06% and 4.75% propolis additions can improve the overall acceptance, taste, and odor of PSFC (sugar-free chewing gum) and PSC (sugary chewing gum), respectively. The biological activity of optimized PSC and PSFC were investigated in terms of total phenolic and flavanoid content, antioxidant power, and antibacterial effect against Streptococcus mutans. The results of the present study showed that the 5 min chewed PSC showed a higher inhibition zone on Streptococcus mutans, which was 7.10 mm. The second significant finding was that the total phenolic content, total flavonoid, and antioxidant power of the chewing gum bolus increased after the chewing simulation. Suitable bioactive molecule delivery kinetic model was used for the determination of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) releasing, and CAPE was released 80% and 50% in 10 min for PSC and PSFC, respectively. One of the most significant findings in this study was that propolis resin was suitable for chewing gum formulations. Consequently, chewing gum can be a proper delivery product for transporting bioactive components of resin. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food & Function					Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) has been receiving worldwide attention. Developing safe and effective iron supplements is of great significance for IDA treatment. Tegillarca granosa (T. granosa), a traditional aquaculture bivalve species in China, is considered to be an excellent source of micronutrients, but the distribution and bioavailability of these minerals have yet to be investigated. The present research was conducted to determine the contents and in vitro enzymatic digestibility of minerals in T. granosa, using beef and wheat flour as reference foods. Meanwhile, two iron-binding proteins, hemoglobin and ferritin, were extracted from T. granosa, and their structures, iron accessibility and bioavailability were investigated. Moreover, the effects of ascorbic acid (AA) and citric acid (CA), two commonly applied dietary factors, on these parameters were evaluated. Our results indicated that the mineral levels varied significantly among different food matrices, with T. granosa showing the highest contents of the tested elements. Comparison of iron absorption of meat versus wheat flour and hemoglobin versus ferritin confirmed that heme iron exhibited higher bioavailability than non-heme iron. The addition of the two organic acids notably enhanced the cellular iron uptake of T. granosa-derived proteins. This could be because AA/CA weakened hydrogen bonds within proteins and caused disordered secondary structures, thereby improving their enzymatic digestibility and releasing more soluble iron to be available for absorption. The results of this study provided a basis for the development of T. granosa-derived protein-based iron supplements, promoting the diverse utilization of marine aquatic resources. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	22	11491	11502	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01650d					FSTA:2022-03-Re0842

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Squid skin, often discarded as processing by-product, is a good resource of collagen/gelatin. In this study, acid soluble collagen (ASC), pepsin soluble collagen (PSC) and water soluble gelatin (WSG) were extracted from squid (Dosidicus gigas) skin and physicochemically examined. The lowest yield of 33.5% was obtained for ASC extracted at 4 °C, and the addition of pepsin increased the collagen yield by around 35.0% (PSC). The highest yield of 81.9% (WSG) was achieved by thermal extraction at 60 °C. A low temperature can largely retain the native helix structures of ASC and PSC, contrariwise, thermal treatment converted collagen into gelatin with unordered and renatured structures. The proline and hydroxyproline contents of ASC, PSC and WSG were 183/1000 residues, 194/1000 residues and 175/1000 residues, respectively. In addition, WSG showed a denaturation temperature at 80.7 °C which was much higher than that of ASC (24.2 °C) and PSC (26.2 °C), while a significant lower resistance towards enzymatic digestion. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3443	3454	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14968					FSTA:2021-10-Re3648
J		Bon-Jae Gu; Kerr, C. J.; Morris, C. F.; Girish M. Ganjyal							Soft durum wheat as a potential ingredient for direct expanded extruded products.		Journal of Cereal Science					Soft durum wheat was extruded to assess the influence of independent parameters (moisture content, screw speed, and barrel temperature each) on system responses (back pressure, torque value, and specific mechanical energy input) and product responses (expansion ratio, unit density, water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI)). The lowest barrel temperature (120 °C) and moisture content (16%) with the highest screw speed (250 rpm) resulted in the highest specific mechanical energy input, expansion ratio, and water solubility index in the extrudates. Among the three independent parameters evaluated, moisture content was the most influential factor on the system and product responses. Energy efficiency on solubility (EES) was defined, and the notable impact of moisture content on EES was observed. Extrudates made from soft durum wheat had a reasonable expansion ratio, proving its potential usage in snack and cereal products.

Tucuma (Astrocaryum aculeatum) prevents oxidative and DNA damage to retinal pigment epithelium cells.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Eye diseases have a negative impact on the eyesight quality of the world population. The age-related macular degeneration (AMD) draws special attention since it is a chronic disorder characterized by oxidative and inflammatory damage to the retinal epithelial pigment, which triggers progressive vision loss. In the Brazilian Amazon, Astrocaryum aculeatum is an Amazonian fruit (Tucuma) used by riverside communities in traditional medicine to treat a number of ailments. These communities have recently shown to have increased longevity and reduced prevalence of age-related morbidity. Thus, the aim of this research was to chemically characterize and analyze the in vitro antioxidant effect and molecular damage prevention of the Tucuma ethanolic extract in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells in a model for AMD. The extract was chemically characterized by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with diode-array detection and mass spectrophotometry (HPLC-DAD-MS). In vitro protocols were performed, and the cytopreventive effect of Tucuma on RPE cells exposed to high concentrations of superoxide anion, an oxidant and genotoxic molecule, as well as the effect of Tucuma extract on oxidative and molecular makers were assessed. Biochemical and flow cytometry analyses were conducted in these protocols. The extract presents high concentrations of caffeic acid, gallic acid, catechin, luteolin, quercetin, and rutin. Treatment did not show cytotoxic effects in cells treated only with extract at 50 mug/mL. In fact, it improved cell viability and was able to prevent necrosis and apoptosis, and oxidative and molecular damage was significantly reduced. In summary, Tucuma is an important Amazon fruit, which seems to contribute significantly to improve human health conditions, as our findings suggest that its extract has a relevant chemical matrix rich in antioxidant molecules, and its consumption could improve eye health and contribute to prevention against oxidative stress through cytoprevention, reactive oxygen species reduction, and maintenance of DNA integrity in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.										2021	24	10	1050	1057	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.0171					FSTA:2022-08-Jg10975
J		Bonanno, A.; Mendis, S. S.							Too cool for farm to school? Analyzing the determinants of farm to school programming continuation.		Food Policy					Among the various food school programs adopted in the U.S., the Farm to School Program (FTSP) is unique in its aims to improve school children's dietary outcomes and to support farm income. As repeated food school interventions/programs are more likely to affect students' dietary outcomes than one-time efforts, school districts' continued participation in FTSP activities is paramount for the program's effectiveness. We use data from the Farm to School Census to evaluate differences across school districts participating in the FTSP which decided to continue or not the program, and to assess the determinants of their continuation decision, using a sample-selection probit estimator. Mean comparisons show that, compared to school districs staying in the program, school districts ceasing FTSP are smaller, more reliant on federal assistance programs, with a higher share of students on federal benefits programs, lower overall per-student expenditures, higher per-student food services expenditure and lower awareness of the USDA geographic preference option. However, these factors do not appear to be direct determinants of the probability of continuation, except the awareness of the USDA geographic preference option, which is strongly associated with continuation. Also, we find that the types and number of FTS activities (particularly promotional activities, and activities taking place in the cafeteria) contribute to explaining the decision to continue FTSP more than the challenges experienced when procuring local foods. We find mixed results regarding the association between state-level policies and a school district's probability of participating and continuing in FTSP. In summary, while policy efforts to ensure continued FTSP participation by smaller and more disadvantaged school districts are needed, efforts to increase awareness of the federal geographic procurement preference option, and policies focusing on promotional and cafetia based activites, may sustain continued FTSP participation in the long-run.

J		Bonardi, S.; Blagojevic, B.; Belluco, S.; Roasto, M.; Gomes-Neves, E.; Vagsholm, I.							Food chain information in the European pork industry: where are we?		Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. The European General Food Law (Regulation No 178/2002) declares that risk analysis should be the basis of food legislation to achieve a high level of protection of human health. Concerning meat safety, the food chain information (FCI) set down by Regulation No 853/2004 is a very important tool that is required for animals admitted to slaughter. To properly integrate FCI, harmonised epidemiological indicators (HEIs) have been proposed by EFSA for high priority risks and risks that might emerge in the future. Scope and approach. In the pig meat chain, the HEIs within meat inspection cover Salmonella spp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Toxoplasma gondii, Trichinella spp., Taenia soliumand mycobacteria.Nevertheless, ten years after the HEIs specification were published, only two biological hazards (TrichinellaandSalmonella) are included in official control programs in the EU countries. While Trichinella monitoring is mandatory,Salmonellacontrol plans have been implemented by some countries only. Key findings and conclusions. In countries where Salmonella in pigs is monitored at farm level, the status of the farm is described in the FCI. This information is crucial for the risk manager to organise slaughter operations and implement hygienic measures, as well as for the competent authorities to properly follow inspection procedures and additional controls according to Regulation No 2019/627. Since FCI needs to enable forward and backward flow of information on animal and public health hazards between all operators involved in pig husbandry and pig meat production, its implementation with HEIs will allow risk-based decision making in food safety.

J		Bonatto, D.							The diversity of commercially available ale and lager yeast strains and the impact of brewer's preferential yeast choice on the fermentative beer profiles.		Food Research International					Yeasts from the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ale yeast) and Saccharomyces pastorianus (lager yeast) are the main component of beer fermentation. It is known that different beer categories depend on the use of specific ale or lager strains, where the yeast imprints its distinctive fermentative profile to the beer. Despite this, there are no studies reporting how diverse, rich, and homogeneous the beer categories are in terms of commercially available brewing yeast strains. In this work, the diversity, richness, and evenness of different beer categories and commercial yeast strains available for brewing were evaluated by applying quantitative concepts of diversity analysis in a sample of 119,189 beer recipes. For this purpose, the frequency of ale or lager and dry or liquid yeast formulations usage was accessed and its correlation with the number of yeast strains, recipes, lowest and highest values of original and final gravity, international bitter units, and alcohol by volume were analyzed. A statistical framework was applied for comparing the lowest and highest fermentation temperature as well as the attenuation percentage for ale and lager yeasts strains in both dry and liquid formulations. Additionally, the brewer's preferential use of a specific brewing yeast strain in comparison to all different yeast strains reported for a beer category was estimated. The results indicated that many beer categories are preferentially fermented with dry yeast formulations instead of liquid yeasts, despite the high number of available liquid yeast formulations. Finally, the preferential use of specific yeast formulations drives the fermentative diversity of a beer category, showing that many yeast strains are potentially and industrially underexplored.

J		Boncinelli, F.; Piracci, G.; Casini, L.							Understanding the role of information and taste heterogeneity in consumer preferences for functional beef: the case of the omega-3 enriched burger.		Meat Science					Beef demand has progressively decreased due to an increasing number of consumers who perceive beef as harmful to their health, among other causes. In contrast, functional foods are one of the fastest-growing markets. This study aims to analyse consumer preferences and estimates the willingness to pay for beef enriched with omega-3 fatty acids. We intend to identify and profile the potential market segments for functional beef and determine how the provision of information can affect consumer preferences. Data have been collected by applying a choice experiment on a sample of 757 Italian beef purchasers. The sample was randomly split into two information treatments plus a control group. Participants in the information treatments were given an explanation about the functional meat production system. Results showed that the average consumer has a preference for omega-3 enrichment and that information about the food's production process increases this preference. Therefore, the study reveals the existence of a potentially profitable market for functional beef. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Hydrocolloids					Wheat bran incorporation in bread has multiple health benefits, but also a detrimental effect on overall bread quality. Bran is hypothesised to withdraw water from gluten, resulting in less optimal viscoelastic dough properties and a lower gas retention capacity, in turn resulting in a decreased bread loaf volume. In this study, wheat bran samples having different water retention capacities were produced and used to investigate this hypothesis. Gluten-starch model systems were used and the effect of substitution of part of the starch by bran in combination with different water absorptions and mixing times was evaluated. The properties of the gluten network in the doughs were investigated using rheological and microstructural analyses and these properties were linked to the final bread loaf volume. A proper gluten network microstructure, as visualised with CLSM, could be achieved in the presence of wheat bran. However, significant effects of the type of wheat bran, water absorption and mixing time on dough rheology and loaf volume were observed. Wheat bran addition decreased the strain hardening of dough despite optimisation of water absorption and mixing time. The deleterious effect of wheat bran on dough rheology increased by adding modified wheat bran with high water retention capacity and surface area. The results indicate that dynamic water redistribution after mixing and gas cell incorporation can have an effect on dough rheology when wheat bran is added to dough. The strain hardening behaviour of dough proved itself a valuable predictor of bread loaf volume also in the presence of (modified) wheat bran.

Exploring the aromatic complexity of Sardinian red wines obtained from minor and rare varieties.		European Food Research and Technology					Sardinia has an important heritage of autochthonous grape varieties, most of which are not widely known or cultivated. The aromatic profile of 19 wines (free and glycoconjugate fractions), obtained from different minor varieties, was investigated to contribute to their oenological characterisation. From a genetic point of view, most of the studied varieties are identical to certain Mediterranean grapes, while a few have been recognised as a native of the Corso-Sardinian area. All wines analyzed were produced from grapes harvested in 2014 following the same protocol and under microvinification conditions. Both instrumental data and sensorial analysis highlighted a significant contribution of varietal compounds linked to an unusual aromatic profile in the wines produced from certain native Sardinian varieties namely, Giro di Gonnos, Amansosu Triei, Gregu Nieddu and Nera di Bosa. In the context of an increasingly globalized market, the aromatic originality of these wines could be appreciated for commercial success. ©Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Food Hydrocolloids					The present work describes a sample preparation method using acid decomposition in reflux system for the determination of Hg on xanthan gum samples by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometry (CV AAS). The best conditions of sample preparation method were optimized. This procedure proved to be safe for the quantification of this analyte, because no significant losses of Hg by volatilization, which is due to the efficient reflux system. The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0049 and 0.0163 mug g-1, respectively. The accuracy was evaluated through recovery tests performed with different species of Hg and CRM analysis, obtaining excellent recoveries. The values of Hg were below the LOD(m) for xanthan gum samples A and B. However, the other samples showed concentrations in the range of 0.027-0.325 mug g-1. The method proves suitable for the quantification of Hg, which is important due to the wide applicability of xanthan gum. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					This study presents information about the total concentration and bioaccessible fraction of barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), potassium (K), lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) in different cultivars of tomato (Gaucho, Paulista, Italiano and Cherry) and their derivatives (sauce and tomato extract). The determinations were performed by microwave induced plasma optical emission spectrometry (MIP OES). The bioaccessible fraction of the elements was evaluated through in vitro digestion process and the concentrations varied between 25 and 100 % ​for Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn, depending on the type of tomato sample and its derivatives. The total concentrations for all the elements studied were below the recommendation of dietary guidelines. For Ba, only the Italiano sample presented 22 % of bioaccessibility. For Pb, the highest percentage of bioaccessible fraction was found in sauces and tomato extracts. The elements Cd, Hg, Li and Mo presented concentrations lower than the limit of detection for the bioaccessibility method.

Determination of antibiotic residues in honey in relation to different potential sources and relevance for food inspection.		Food Chemistry					Honey contaminations could derive from intensive agriculture and industrial activities, but also from beekeeper treatments. In EU no MRLs for antibiotics in honey are set, only a minimum required performance limit for chloramphenicol of 0.3 mug kg-1 is recommended. Screening tests are available, characterised by their rapidity and simple use. Due to their high rate of false positives and the need to meet zero tolerance levels for antibiotics, their presence in samples was investigated using a liquid chromatography High Resolution Mass Spectrometry (LC-HRMS) multiclass antibiotic residue method, comparing the results with those of previous screening tests. The confirmatory method showed good sensitivity: CCalpha and CCbeta ranging from 0.03 to 4.80 ng g-1 and from 0.12 to 5.56 ng g-1, respectively. Ninety-eight honey samples from different geographical areas, analysed by two screening tests, showed a high percentage of false positives. This is fundamental to guarantee honey safety, especially, for organic production. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Progression of different udder inflammation indicators and their episode length after onset of inflammation using automatic milking system sensor data.		Journal of Dairy Science					In automatic milking systems (AMS), sensors can measure cow behavior and milk composition at every milking. The aim of this observational study of previously collected data was to gain insight into the differences in dynamics of udder inflammation indicators between cows that recover and those that do not recover after detection of an initial inflammation. Milk diversion (milk separated from the bulk tank and thus indicating farmer intervention), conductivity, and somatic cell count (SCC) data from 4 wk before the initial inflammation to 12 wk after the initial inflammation were used to analyze 2,584 cases of udder inflammation. An udder inflammation case was defined as an initial observation of SCC ≥200,000 cells/mL as well as 1 additional SCC measurement >200,000 cells/mL within 10 d after the initial case, among other requirements. The data originated from 15 AMS herds in 6 countries. Four subsets of cows were created based on whether milk was diverted after the initial inflammation and whether the udder inflammation cases recovered, using a 10-d rolling average SCC threshold of 200,000 cells/mL and checking whether this rolling mean was below the threshold within 90 d after the initial inflammation as the indication of recovery. This formed the following subsets of cow lactations: milk diverted-recovered, milk diverted-not recovered, no milk diverted-not recovered, no milk diverted-recovered. Thresholds of 100,000 SCC/mL and 300,000 SCC/mL for the definition of case and recovery were also applied in a sensitivity analysis but with no substantial difference in results. Linear mixed models were used for each subset to study the variation in SCC (natural logarithm of SCC divided by 1,000) and sigma-conductivity (natural logarithm of standard deviation of quarter conductivities). When observing the fraction of cows with SCC <200,000 cells/mL in the recovery subsets, most cows recovered within 20 d after the initial inflammation. In the recovery subsets, both sigma-conductivity and SCC stabilized, mostly within 3 to 4 wk after the initial inflammation. sigma-Conductivity stabilized above the pre-onset level in all subsets and did not show a clear increase in the no-milk-diverted subgroups, whereas SCC stabilized closer to the pre-onset level. Overall, this study indicated a cutoff point between nonchronic and chronic changes in indicators 3 to 4 wk after the initial inflammation for SCC and sigma-conductivity.

J		Bong, J.; Middleditch, M.; Loomes, K. M.; Stephens, J. M.							Proteomic analysis of honey. Identification of unique peptide markers for authentication of NZ manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey.		Food Chemistry					Proteomics is an emerging tool in food authentication that has not been optimised for honey analysis. In this study, we present a qualitative proteomic analysis of New Zealand manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey. A total of fifty bee-derived proteins were identified in the honey, the most predominant being major royal jelly proteins (MRJPs). We also demonstrate for the first time the presence of unique nectar-derived proteins in manuka honey. A total of 17 manuka plant proteins were identified, a-third of which were putative pathogenesis-related proteins. Two proteins involved in drought tolerance were also identified. Twelve candidate peptides were selected as potential authentication markers based on their uniqueness to manuka honey. Nectar analyses confirmed the origin and specificity of these peptides to L. scoparium nectar, thus presenting peptide profiling as a viable and novel approach for manuka honey authentication.

J		Bong Song; Yumeng Zhang; Baojia Yang; Panpan Zhu; Xiaoyang Pang; Ning Xie; Shuwen Zhang; Jiaping Lv							Effect of different temperature-controlled ultrasound on the physical and functional properties of micellar casein concentrate.		Foods					Micellar casein concentrate (MCC) is a novel dairy ingredient with high protein content. However, its poor functional properties impair its potential for further application, highlighting the importance of using innovative processing methods to produce modified MCC, such as ultrasound (US). This work investigated the impact of US on the physical and functional properties of MCC under temperature-controlled and-uncontrolled conditions for different time intervals. Under temperature-controlled ultrasound (TC-US) treatment, a reduction was found in the supernatant particle size of casein micelles. Soluble calcium content and hydrophobicity increased following ultrasound treatment at 20°C, resulting in a remarkable improvement in emulsification. However, long-time ultrasonication led to an unstable state, causing the MCC solutions to show shear thinning behavior (pseudoplastic fluid). Compared with 50°C temperature-controlled ultrasonication, ultrasonication at 20°C had a greater influence on particle size, viscosity and hydrophobicity. These findings indicate that 20°C TC-US could be a promising technology for the modification of MCC. © 2021 by the authors.

A single method to analyse residues from five different classes of prohibited pharmacologically active substances in milk.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					In the European Union, the use of veterinary drugs belonging to the A6 group is prohibited in food-producing animals according to Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2010/37. The aim of this study was to improve the analytical control strategy by developing a single method to analyse residues of prohibited pharmacologically active substances in milk. For this, a single method was developed to analyse 16 prohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five different substance classes at required or recommended levels: nitroimidazoles at 3 mug kg-1, nitrofurans at 0.5 mug kg-1, chloramphenicol at 0.1 mug kg-1, dapsone at 5 mug kg-1 and chlorpromazine at 1 mug kg-1. Milk sample preparation started with an acid hydrolysis combined with a derivatisation. These steps were followed by a clean-up consisting of a dispersive solid-phase extraction and a liquid-liquid extraction. Finally, the sample extracts were analysed by liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry, operating alternately in the positive and negative mode. The method was fully validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC for bovine milk and additionally validated for caprine milk. The validation proved that the method is highly effective to detect and confirm all 16 substances in bovine and caprine milk and, additionally to quantify 15 of these substances in bovine milk and 13 of these substances in caprine milk. This study resulted in a new multi-class method to detect, quantify and confirm the identity of 16 prohibited pharmacologically active substances belonging to five different substance classes in two types of milk. © 2021 The Author(s).

Aflatoxin contamination in Tanzania: quantifying the problem in maize and groundnuts from rural households.		World Mycotoxin Journal					Aflatoxins are toxic and carcinogenic secondary metabolites, produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus, which contaminate food and feed and threaten human and animal health. To assess the prevalence of aflatoxins in Tanzania, 180 groundnut and 200 maize samples were collected from 9 and 10 districts, respectively. Aflatoxin contamination was quantified using high performance liquid chromatography. Aflatoxins were detected in samples collected from all districts and prevalence ranged from 92 to 100% for groundnuts and 10 to 80% for maize. The mean aflatoxin level for groundnuts was 6.37 mug/kg and the highly contaminated sample had 40.31 mug/kg. For maize, the mean aflatoxin level was 12.47 mug/kg and the highly contaminated sample had 162.40 mug/kg. The estimated average probable daily intake (APDI) of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from groundnuts consumption was 1.88 ng/kg body weight/day, while for maize, it ranged between 151.98-272.89 ng/kg body weight/day. The APDI for both groundnut and maize exceeded the provisional maximum tolerable daily intake (PMTDI) of AFB1 for adults (1 ng/kg body weight/day), bringing about health concerns for populations in Tanzania. Another alarming finding was that 75% of the farmers who provided samples for analysis were not aware of aflatoxins or the negative health impacts from consuming contaminated products. Results reported in this paper show that aflatoxin contaminated staple crops are widely distributed in Tanzania and that the risk of human exposure is high due to diet preferences. Awareness campaigns are required to inform and protect farmers and consumers.										2021	14	4	553	564	1875-0710				10.3920/WMJ2020.2646					FSTA:2022-11-Cd3669

Chemical reactivity of nitrite and ascorbate in a cured and cooked meat model implication in nitrosation, nitrosylation and oxidation.		Food Chemistry					Nitrite, added to cured meat for its bacteriological and technological properties, is implicated in the formation of nitroso compounds (NOCs), such as nitrosylheme, nitrosamines and nitrosothiols, suspected to have a potential impact on human health. The mechanisms involved in NOC formation are studied in regard with the dose-response relationship of added nitrite and its interaction with ascorbate on NOC formation in a cured and cooked meat model. The impact of a second cooking stage on nitrosation was evaluated. The addition of nitrite in the cured and cooked model promoted heme iron nitrosylation and S-nitrosation but not N-nitrosation. Nitrite reduced lipid oxidation without an additional ascorbate effect. The second cooking sharply increased the nitrosamine content while the presence of ascorbate considerably lowered their levels and protected nitrosothiols from degradation. This study gives new insights on the chemical reactivity of NOCs in a cured meat model.

New insights into the chemical reactivity of dry-cured fermented sausages: focus on nitrosation, nitrosylation and oxidation.		Foods					Nitrite and nitrate are added to cured meat for their bacteriological, technological and sensorial properties. However, they are suspected to be involved in the formation of nitroso compounds (NOCs), such as potentially mutagenic nitrosamines, nitrosylheme and nitrosothiols. Controlling the sanitary and sensorial qualities of cured meat products by reducing these additives requires elucidating the mechanisms involved in the formation of NOCs. To this end, we studied the dose-response relationship of added sodium nitrite and/or sodium nitrate (0/0, 80/80, 0/200, and 120/120 ppm) on the formation of NOCs in dry cured fermented sausages. The results showed a basal heme iron nitrosylation in the absence of NaNO2/NaNO3 due to starter cultures. This reaction was promoted by the addition of NaNO2/NaNO3 in the other conditions. Reducing the dose to 80/80 ppm still limits lipid oxidation without the formation of non-volatile nitrosamines. Conversely, the addition of NO2/NO3 slightly increases protein oxidation through higher carbonyl content. The use of 80/80 ppm could be a means of reducing these additives in dry-cured fermented meat products. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bonifazi, G.; Capobianco, G.; Gasbarrone, R.; Serranti, S.							Contaminant detection in pistachio nuts by different classification methods applied to short-wave infrared hyperspectral images.		Food Control					In this paper different multivariate classification methods applied to hyperspectral images acquired in the short-wave infrared range (SWIR: 1000-2500 nm) were evaluated for quality control of pistachio nuts. In more detail, the detection of contaminants in edible pistachio products was assessed. Six material classes (i.e. edible and inedible pistachio nuts, pistachio shells, pistachio husks, twigs, and stones) were investigated. Samples were divided into two groups: a training set and a validation set. The acquired hyperspectral images were first explored by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The following multivariate classification methods were selected in order to verify and compare their efficiency and robustness: Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA), Principal Component Analysis with Discriminant Analysis (PCA-DA), Principal Component Analysis with k-Nearest Neighbor (PCA-kNN), and Classification And Regression Tree (CART). The classification results obtained for the four models in terms of prediction maps and values of the performance parameters (Sensitivity, Specificity, and Efficiency) were good in most cases. The main misclassification errors occur between "Edible pistachio" and "Inedible pistachio" classes and between "Pistachio shell", "Pistachio husk", and "Twig" classes, confirming the similar spectral features of such classes observed by PCA. PCA-kNN provided the best discrimination ability in prediction, with Efficiency values from 0.92 to 0.99, followed by PLS-DA and PCA-DA. The performance of CART decreased from the calibration to the validation phase. The overall results demonstrated that SWIR-HSI technology, coupled with multivariate analysis modeling, is a promising approach to develop both "off-line" and "on-line" fast, reliable and robust contaminant detection in edible pistachios.

Modeling the behavior of Listeria innocua in Italian salami during the production and high-pressure validation of processes for exportation to the U.S..		Meat Science					A model describing Listeria innocua evolution according to process parameters of 51 Italian salami processes and HPP in 31 companies was developed. A total of 51 challenge tests were performed. During processing a L. innocua reduction of 0.34-4.32 Log10 CFU/g was observed and HPP further reduced the count of 0.48-3.47 Log10 CFU/g; an overall reduction of 1.04-5.68 is reached. PH after acidification/drying process, aw after seasoning, duration of the seasoning and caliber resulted associated (p< 0.05) with L. innocua decrease. HPP efficacy was associated (p < 0.05) with aw and pH of the product: higher the pH and aw after the acidification/drying and seasoning phases, higher resulted the L. innocua reduction after HPP. No significant association was observed between L. innocua and salt, nitrate and starter content and other characteristics of process. The model meets companies and Authorities needs and represents a useful tool to predict L. monocytogenes lethality, giving recommendations to food business operators interested in exportation to the U.S. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Genetic parameters associated with meat quality of Nellore cattle at different anatomical points of longissimus: Brazilian standards.		Meat Science					The present study estimated genetic parameters and evaluated the genetic and phenotypic correlations between meat quality characteristics of Nellore cattle evaluated at different anatomical points of the longissimus. Data from 1329 Nellore young bulls were used to evaluate, in the 5th and 12th ribs, marbling score (MAR), shear force (SF), cooking weight losses (CWL) and intramuscular fat (IMF). In addition, the subcutaneous fat thickness was measured at the 12th rib (SFT12) and between the last lumbar and the first sacral vertebrae (SFTLR), in the separation of loin and round. Results yielded moderate heritability coefficients for evaluated characteristics, except CWL. High genetic correlations (0.61) were found between measurements of SFT12 and SFTLR. MAR, IMF and SF were evaluated at the 5th and 12th rib. Meat quality and subcutaneous fat thickness measured at different anatomical points of the longissimus are genetically correlated and can be used in genetic selection programs to improve meat quality characteristics in Nellore cattle.

Food Policy					Women's empowerment is essential to improve nutrition in low and middle-income countries. We investigated the empowerment of women in agriculture in association with household production and the dietary diversity of children 12-59 months old and their mothers in Timor-Leste. Using the Abbreviated Women's Empowerment in Agriculture Index (A-WEAI) we analyzed 156 dual-adult rural households applying multivariable regression models. We found that the dietary diversity scores of empowered women and their children were higher than among those disempowered. The associations between different measures of empowerment and dietary diversity were larger and more significant among women than children. Food production diversity was consistently associated with children's improved diets. We found small gender gaps in decisions on production, access to resources, and control over income, similar to findings in other Southeast Asian countries. Nutrition-sensitive policies and programmes in Timor-Leste could gain from prioritizing women's empowerment and promoting agriculture diversification strategies as valuable investments to improve the diets and wellbeing of mothers and children.

Preharvest factors affecting quality on "Abate Fetel" pears: study of superficial scald with multivariate statistical approach.		Journal of Food Quality					Although superficial scald (SS) is well characterized on apples, there are only a few insights concerning the influence that agronomic and management variability may have on the occurrence of this physiological disorder on pears. In this study, we aimed to improve our understanding of the effect of different preharvest factors on SS development using a multivariate statistical approach. Pears (Pyrus communis L.) cv "Abate Fetel" were picked during two consecutive seasons (2018-2019 and 2019-2020) from twenty-three commercial orchards from three growing areas (Modena, Ferrara, and Ravenna provinces) in the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy. Bioclimatic indices such as weather and soil, agronomic management such fertilization and irrigation, orchard features such as rootstock and training systems, and SS incidence were carried out at harvest and periodically postharvest in all producers. Two different storage scenarios (regular atmosphere and use of 1-MCP) were also evaluated. Our data in both seasons showed high heterogeneity between farms for SS symptoms after cold storage either in the regular atmosphere or with 1-MCP treatment. Nevertheless, in 2018, all the producers showed SS at the end of the storage season, but in 2019 some of them did not exhibit SS for up to 5 months. In fact, some preharvest factors changed considerably between the two seasons such as yield and weather conditions. Indeed, some factors seem to affect SS in both growing seasons. Some can increase its occurrences such as physiological and agronomical factors: high yields, late date of blooming, heavy downpours, improper irrigation management (low watering frequency and high volumes), nitrogen (included that deriving from organic matter), soil texture (presence of clay), orchard age, and canopy volume in relation to training system and rootstock. Others can decrease SS such as climatic and management factors: late harvest dates, rain, gibberellins, calcium, manure, absence of antihail nets or use of photoselective nets, and site (probably related to better soils toward the Adriatic coast). Initial preharvest variability is an important factor that modulates physiological plant stress and, subsequently, the SS after cold storage in "Abate Fetel" pears. Multivariate techniques could represent useful tools to identify reliable multiyear preharvest variables for SS control in pear fruit different batches.

Microbiological and chemical properties of chokeberry juice fermented by novel lactic acid bacteria with potential probiotic properties during fermentation at 4 °C for 4 weeks.		Foods					On the frame of this research survey, a novel potentially probiotic strain (Lactobacillus paracasei SP5) recently isolated from kefir grains was evaluated for chokeberry juice fermentation. Chokeberry juice was retrieved from the variety Aronia melanocarpa, a plant known to provide small, dark berries and to be one of the richest sources of antioxidants. The juice was subsequently fermented inoculating L. paracasei SP5 for 48 h at 30 °C. The fermented juices were left at 4 °C and tested regarding microbiological and physicochemical characteristics for 4 weeks. The potentially probiotic strain was proved capable of performing lactic acid fermentation at 30 °C. Cell viability of L. paracasei was detected in high levels during fermentation and the whole storage period, while the fermented juice showed higher levels of viability in juice with 40.3 g/L of initial sugar concentration. No ethanol was detected in the final fermented juice. Fermented chokeberry juice was characterized by aromatic desirable volatiles, which were retained in adequate levels for the whole storage period. Specifically, the occurrence of organic esters detected in fermented juices is considered as positive evidence of the provision of fruity and floral notes to the final product. During storage, total phenolics content and antioxidant activity were observed in higher levels in fermented chokeberry juice compared with non-fermented juice. Subsequently, fermentation of chokeberry juice by potentially probiotic lactic acid bacteria could provide high industrialization potential, providing the market with a nutritional beverage of good volatile quality with an enhanced shelf-life compared with an unfermented fresh juice. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Chemistry					Rice is known to contain limiting amino acids. Synthesis of GABA in plants is an adaptive response by initiating glutamic acid. A higher rate of GABA production was observed in samples enriched with glutamic acid and vacuum impregnation (VI) with longer germination time. Heat map profiles classified GABA and essential amino acids into 1) small increments consisting of Arg, His and Met, 2) moderate increments consisting of GABA, Trp, Lys, Phe and Thr, and 3) large increments consisting of Ile, Leu and Val. In Jasmine rice, highest essential amino acids were found in samples soaked with water, enriched with glutamic acid, and germinated for 72-96 h. Highest GABA (44.8 mg/100 g) was noticed after VI for 20-40 min and germinated for 72-96 h. In Riceberry, highest GABA (74.2 mg/100 g) and essential amino acids were associated with samples treated with VI for 20-40 min and germinated for 96 h.

Valorization of ultrasound assisted restructured soy protein: Impact on the quality characteristics of instant noodles.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The food application of ultrasound-assisted restructured soy protein (re-SP) was evaluated by analyzing the impact on functional, textural, sensorial, in-vitro protein digestibility (IVPD), thermal, rheological, and morphological attributes of instant noodles. The incorporation of re-SP significantly (P≤0.05) increased the water absorption capacity, water solubility index, oil binding, and gelation capacity of the semolina, and also considerably (P≤0.05) altered the pasting profile. The re-SP also facilitated the mixing, binding, balls, and sheets forming behavior of dough. Rheological results also validated the impact of re-SP on the handling properties of dough as the storage (G') and loss (G'') modulus showed a constant optimum increasing trend with frequency. The re-SP significantly (P≤0.05) decreased the cooking loss (about 9.5%-17%) and increased the hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, gumminess, chewiness, resilience, and overall acceptability thus, imparting the structural strength and integrity with their resistance to wear and tear during handling and manufacturing. The re-SP also significantly (P≤0.05) altered the thermal behavior and showed higher IVPD (87.070.41). The increased network continuity and noodles" structure with compact and closed integrity, confirmed from morphology, also validated the adequacy for re-SP fortification.

Production of hydrogen peroxide in formulated beverages is associated with the presence of ascorbic acid combined with selected redox-active functional ingredients.		Food Chemistry					Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species (ROS) that mediates essential signaling in vivo but may cause irreversible tissue damage under dysregulated or acute exposure conditions. Beverages containing redox-active compounds might produce H2O2 during shelf storage and potentially be consumed. Concentrations of H2O2 in selected "functional" (including energy, E, n=28), "non-functional" flavored, (S, n=6) and mineral water (W, n=6) drinks were measured under ambient (i.e., produced in situ) and "potentiated" conditions (i.e., H2O2 production enhanced by addition of a reducing agent, to simulate availability of reducible substrates in vivo). Under air-saturated conditions, mean H2O2 contents were: 15.6015.84; 1.392.06 and 0.300.21 M in E, S and W drinks, respectively. Under air-saturated, potentiated conditions, mean rates of H2O2 production were 21.733.3,0.982.84, and-0.381.18 M/h for E, S and W drinks, respectively. Using multivariate statistics, the ingredient significantly associated with H2O2 production in combination with other ingredients was found to be ascorbic acid. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Bioscience					The use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces yeast species as mixed starters has advantages over pure culture fermentation because of increased wine sensory characteristics. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the divergences of wine compositions fermented by indigenous non-Saccharomyces strains (Torulaspora delbrueckii TD12 and Lachancea thermotolerans LT9) or commercial non-Saccharomyces strains (T. delbrueckii Prelude and L. thermotolerans Concerto) combined with S. cerevisiae D254, respectively. Results. Evidenced that although belong to the same species, the content of chemical and aromatic compounds of red wines produced by indigenous and commercial strains was significantly different after alcoholic fermentation (ALF) and malolactic fermentation (MLF). TD12/D254 was characterized with a higher amount of glycerol, ethyl esters, and volatile acids, whilst Prelude/D254 was distinguished by a higher intensity of isoamyl acetate and a lower production of acetic acid. LT9/D254 increased the intensity of higher alcohols, esters, and beta-damascenone compared with Concerto/D254. After MLF, the diversities variation of glycerol and lactic acid were increased, but acetic acid and most volatile compounds were reduced. TD12/D254 obtained better aromatic quality as assessed by calculating the odor activity values (OAVs). Our results highlighted the strain-specificity of non-Saccharomyces strains in shaping the aromatic characteristic of wine, and suggested that more attention should be paid to the strain-specific characteristics when selecting non-Saccharomyces strains to improve aroma diversity and quality of the wine. In this regard, the indigenous strain is a suitable choice because of better adaptation to fermentation conditions and generating typical sensory characteristics specific to the wine region.

J		Boqin Zhang; Changqing Duan; Guoliang Yan							Effects of mediums on fermentation behaviour and aroma composition in pure and mixed culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with Torulaspora delbrueckii.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The nutrient status and composition in mediums have a significant effect on yeast metabolism and phenotypic characteristics in wine fermentation. In this study, the effects of three frequently used mediums, including synthetic grape juice (SGJ), grape juice without grape pericarp and seeds (GJ) and grape must with grape pericarp and seeds (GMPS), on yeast fermentation behaviour and aroma compounds produced by pure and mixed culture of Saccharomyces cerevisiae T73 with Torulaspora delbrueckii TD20 were investigated after alcoholic fermentation. The results showed that high fermentation activities and cell population were always found in GJ medium irrespective of inoculated approach. More esters and higher alcohols were produced in GMPS medium fermented by pure S. cerevisiae, while SGJ medium had increased levels of fatty acids. Consistent with previous literatures, the mixed fermentation of T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae produced more acetate esters and fatty acids than the pure culture of S. cerevisiae, while this enological trait was only found in SGJ and GJ, not in GMPS. Our results highlighted that more attention should be paid to the fermentation medium when evaluating the enological and aromatic properties of selected yeasts used in industrial winemaking.

Foods					The identification of novel sources of synbiotic agents with desirable functionality is an emerging concept. In the present study, novel encapsulates containing probiotic L. acidophilus LA-05 (LA) and Charantin (CT) were produced by freeze-drying technique using pure Whey Protein Isolate (WPI), pure Maltodextrin (MD), and their combination (WPI + MD) in 1:1 core ratio, respectively. The obtained microparticles, namely WPI + LA + CT, MD + LA + CT, and WPI + MD + LA + CT were tested for their physicochemical properties. Among all formulations, combined carriers (WPI + MD) exhibited the highest encapsulation yields for LA (98%) and CT (75%). Microparticles showed a mean d (4,3) ranging from 50.393 1.26 to 68.412 3.22mum. The Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed uniformly amorphous and glass-like structures, with a noticeably reduced porosity when materials were combined. In addition, Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy highlighted the formation of strong hydrogen bonds supporting the interactions between the carrier materials (WPI and MD) and CT. In addition, the thermal stability of the combined WPI + MD was superior to that of pure WPI and pure MD, as depicted by the Thermogravimetric and Differential Scanning Calorimetry analysis. More interestingly, co-encapsulation with CT enhanced LA viability (8.91 0.3 log CFU/g) and Cells Surface Hydrophobicity (82%) in vitro, in a prebiotic-like manner. Correspondingly, CT content was heightened when co-encapsulated with LA. Besides, WPI + MD + LA + CT microparticles exhibited higher antioxidant activity (79%), alpha-amylase inhibitory activity (83%), and lipase inhibitory activity (68%) than single carrier ones. Furthermore, LA viable count (7.95 0.1 log CFU/g) and CT content (78%) were the highest in the blended carrier materials after 30 days of storage at 4°C. Synbiotic microparticle WPI + MD + LA + CT represents an effective and promising approach for the co-delivery of probiotic culture and bioactive compounds in the digestive tract, with enhanced functionality and storage properties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bora, A. F. M.; Xiaodong Li; Lu Liu; Xiuxiu Zhang							Enhanced in vitro functionality and food application of Lactobacillus acidophilus encapsulated in a whey protein isolate and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate conjugate.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The present study investigated the potential of free radical grafting conjugation of whey protein isolate (WPI) and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), followed by freeze-drying, for the safe delivery of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA) upon digestion and in food systems. WPI-EGCG-LA microspheres presented higher encapsulation efficiency (97%) than native WPI-LA (70%) and maltodextrin (MD-LA 75%). The physicochemical characteristics of all microspheres, including moisture content, water activity, and hygroscopicity, were within the acceptable range for the stability of industrial powders. Scanning electron microscopy of WPI-EGCG-LA revealed a glass-like structure, with a smoother and less porous surface area than WPI-LA and MD-LA, as a result of the strong binding affinity between WPIs and EGCG. Particle sizes ranged from 438.4 to 453.3 mum. The structural stability of WPI-EGCG-LA was further confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectra, which revealed some changes in the protein secondary structure. Thermogravimetric and differential scanning calorimetry analysis showed that WPI-EGCG conjugates had higher thermal stability than native WPIs and MD. Additionally, cells encapsulated in WPI-EGCG conjugates demonstrated higher in vitro survivability and surface hydrophobicity compared to free or WPI-and MD-encapsulated cells. Furthermore, WPI-EGCG-LA microspheres exerted enhanced in vitro antioxidant (78%) and antidiabetic (52%) activities. Finally, the WPI-EGCG conjugates remarkably improved probiotic viability (8.550.1 log cfu/g) during 30 days of storage in an apple juice drink of pH (3.20.01). Hence, the WPI-EGCG conjugate represents a propitious carrier to enhance probiotic functional properties upon digestion and during storage in low-pH food products.		li, xiaofeng/GXF-9442-2022; li, xiao/GSN-6181-2022	Massounga Bora, Awa Fanny/0000-0003-0356-5165							2021	69	37	11074	11084	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02158					FSTA:2022-02-Hr0920
J		Borba, V. S. de; Furlong, V. B.; Cerqueira, M. B. R.; Badiale-Furlong, E.							Fate of trichothecenes B in rice and parboiling process as a mitigation strategy.		Food Control					This study was designed to assess these two critical safety issues in the rice supply chain. First, DON and its acetylated derivatives, 3-ADON and 15-ADON, occurrence was evaluated in different commercial rice subgroups. Subsequently, DON migration dynamics during parboiling was investigated in rice samples from lowland and upland cultivars. These two main goals were designed to increase understanding of contamination risk in rice by trichothecenes and, subsequently, to enable the proposal of a mitigation strategy. The VA-MSPD trichothecenes determination method proved to be reliable and efficient to evaluate rice contamination, with recoveries between 73.4 and 117.4%. Approximately 43.3% of the commercial samples, obtained randomly from the local market, tested positive for DON and/or 15-ADON with contamination level below the LOQ (0.50 mug.kg-1). Whole rice and whole parboiled rice subgroups showed highest incidence, 66.7% and 83.3%, respectively. During parboiling migration studies, milder conditions in gelatinization step had decreased DON migration into the starchy endosperm. With this condition, the mycotoxin remained in the bran in both cultivars (12.0 and 13.4%). Therefore, demonstrating that it is possible to mitigate mycotoxins in polished rice products with minor alterations to current supply chain processes and enhancing security of this staple food.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Pasta that undergoes the cooking exhibits several structural changes that can mainly affect protein and starch availability. In this study a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) 22 was applied to find the best cooking times and pasta: water ratios to prepare commercial semolina pasta (spaghetti) to increase RS levels. Time intervals applied to cooking ranged from 7 to 13 min while the pasta: water ratio ranged from 1:33 to 1:4 (m v-1; g mL-1). Composition of the spaghetti samples was also determined. Cooking times strongly influenced RS formation and water absorption (WA) capacity, since there was mean decrease of 17% in WA and increase of 164% in the RS content when both extreme points (-1.41 and + 1.41) of the experimental design where applied. Protein and ash contents also affected the RS level. Cooking time between 7 and 10 min and pasta: water ratios (from 1:4 to 1:10, m v-1) enabled satisfactory RS contents (from 72.2 to 138.0 mg g-1), which should improve the functional fiber content in the pasta.

Food Control					This paper examines the Romanian consumers' knowledge regarding food hazards and their awareness on certified labelled food, while identifying the sources of information they trust. The study reveals that half of the consumers are not aware of hazards as mycotoxins and pathogenic microorganisms like Listeria, Campylobacter, Yersinia and Clostridium, while they perceive food additives and GMOs as being hazardous. Using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and principal component analysis (PCA), it was found that certified labelled food provides the consumer with a general feeling of trust; however, consumers do not discriminate what the certification is standing for. Also, science books are recognized as trustful sources of information but family and media are the first option at hand for making an opinion on what can put somebody at risk. Applying confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) modelling it was possible to link consumers' knowledge and awareness with their trust and to identify means to communicate in order to fill the existing knowledge gaps and alleviate part of their food related anxieties. Suggestions on how to manage this process are given with the aim to make Romanian consumers understand the efforts of food chain participants to ensure food safety, to avoid confusion on what is risky and what is not, and to determine them to share responsibilities on food safety. The study may inspire strategies for consumer education based on adopting a risk-based approach to food safety not only in Romania, but in other countries too, as similarities may exist.

Microwave-assisted forced convection drying effect on bioactive compounds of the Canadian blueberry leaves (Vaccinium corymbosum).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Canadian blueberry leaves (Vaccinium corymbosum) are a potential source of polyphenols (catechins) and antioxidants (FRAP and PT). In this study, the technique of drying by microwave-assisted forced convection was carried out to find the optimal conditions which would allow obtaining the highest polyphenol content under control parameters such as microwave power (100, 300, and 400 W), hot air velocity (0.5 and 2.0 m/s), leaf size (whole and fractional), and temperatures (50, 60, and 70 °C). It was found that 30 W/g microwave powers and a 60 °C temperature for the process in whole leaves were the optimal conditions that allowed obtaining the highest content of polyphenols (>10 mg/gdb (+) catechin) and antioxidant capacities (100-150 mg GAE/gdb), more than in fractional leaves. It was observed that different hot air velocities did not affect the concentration of the polyphenol's contents; this was verified using the factor mixture analysis technique. Practical applications. The MWFC process allows the preservation of antioxidants in Canadian blueberry leaves (Vaccinium corymbosum). These leaves have high antioxidant capacity for nutraceutical and pharmaceutical uses. This leaf, with high polyphenol content, can be used to obtain extracts in infusions and human food through the mixture of this leaf with multiple powdered products traditionally consumed or food supplements. This research presents the optimal conditions for the preservation of antioxidant compounds in dried Canadian blueberry leaves. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

International Food Research Journal					Marine livings represent one of the richest sources of protein with valuable bioactives. The present work explores the antioxidative potential of stone fish, a sea cucumber species typically discarded as by-catch. Stone fish was enzymatically hydrolysed using papain, and the resulting proteolysate exhibited strong antioxidant activity in DPPH radical scavenging (IC50 = 0.49 mg/mL), ABTS (IC50 = 0.36 mg/mL) radical scavenging, and FRAP value (0.29 mM FeSO4) after 8 h of hydrolysis. Fractionation of proteolysate was then performed using three approaches namely ultrafiltration, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and isoelectric focusing techniques to profile and characterise the antioxidative proteolysate. Results indicated that papain-generated proteolysate from stone fish flesh possessed considerable amount of antioxidative peptides with molecular weight of approximately 2 kDa, low hydrophobicity (< 20%), and pI = 9.

Global volatile signature and polyphenols patterns in Vespolina wines according to vintage.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The global volatile signature of Vespolina wines from different vintages was established using solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-qMS). Wines were also characterised in terms of bioactive compounds (such as individual polyphenols, biogenic amines and their precursors) by high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). In addition, some physicochemical parameters, such as the total phenolic content, total tannins and antioxidant capacity, were evaluated. Seventy-one volatile compounds and thirty-three bioactive compounds were identified in Vespolina wines. The application of multivariate analysis to the obtained data revealed that 2-phenylethyl acetate, ethyl nonanoate, 2-hexanol, isoamyl octanoate and ethyl 2-hydroxymethylbutanoate were the primary compounds responsible for Vespolina wines classification, mainly indicative for wines of 2015 and 2013 vintages. Conversely, wines from 2008 and 2009 vintages showed highest values of procyanidin B1, catechin, gallic acid, trans-piceid and trans-resveratrol. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

First occurrence of tetrodotoxins in bivalve mollusks from Northern Adriatic Sea (Italy).		Food Control					Tetrodotoxins are a potent neurotoxic class of toxins with potentially fatal effects if ingested by humans, and thus, these toxins are a dangerous threat for food safety. Tetrodotoxins are widely distributed among various organisms of different taxa, i.e. pufferfish, blue-ringed octopuses and marine gastropods. Lately the presence of these toxins has been reported in mussels (Mytilus sp.). Countries like the United Kingdom, Greece, the Netherlands, and Italy have increasingly notified the detection of tetrodotoxins in these bivalves, which are widely diffused in European shellfish farming. In this context we report, for the first time, the detection of substantial amounts of tetrodotoxins in Mytilus galloprovincialis collected in Italy in a single area of the Northern Adriatic Sea (Marano Lagoon). Tetrodotoxin-positive mussels were identified in samples collected from that geographic area at the end of May in the context of official monitoring programs both in 2017 and 2018. After the positive results were obtained by means of mouse bioassay screening, tetrodotoxins were detected and quantified by HILIC-MS/MS, revealing the bioaccumulation in the mussels of 541 and 216 mug/kg in 2017 and 2018 respectively, the highest amount ever found in mollusks in Europe. The presence of tetrodotoxins at the concentration of 413 mug/kg was further confirmed with Liquid Chromatography coupled to High Resolution Mass Spectrometry in the mussels sampled in 2017.

Scale-up and optimization of the spray drying conditions for the development of functional microparticles based on chia oil.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					A factorial design was performed for the microencapsulation of chia oil by spray drying at pilot-scale, to validate the results obtained previously at laboratory scale in a Buchi-B290. The effects of drying-air inlet (Tinlet) and outlet (Toutlet) temperatures in a Niro Production Minor on the solid yield, thermal efficiency, theoretical droplet evaporation times, and physico-chemical properties of powders were analyzed. The theoretical droplet evaporation times (0.31-0.54 s) were calculated considering the constant and falling rate periods and a negligible relative velocity between spray and air. Critical diameters between 31.77-41.57 mum were estimated for microcapsules, depending on the process conditions. After scale-up of the spray drying operation, higher solid yields (74.24-79.79%), thermal efficiencies (27.56-73.19%), encapsulation efficiencies (96.97-98.57%), and enhanced flowability of products, compared with experiments at laboratory scale, were observed. Moreover, the scale-up did not affect the chemical composition of microencapsulated oils, their fatty acid composition before and after in-vitro digestion processes. A global optimization was performed at pilot-scale and the process conditions that simultaneously optimized all the responses was 160 °C*90 °C (Tinlet*Toutlet). All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Spray-air contact and operating conditions in tall and short-form co-current spray dryers affect relevant physico-chemical properties of microencapsulated chia oil (Salvia hispanica L.).		Food and Bioproducts Processing					A design of experiments for chia oil microencapsulation was performed in two co-current dryers: a tall-form (TF-SD) and a short-from spray dryer (SF-SD). The effects of air inlet temperature and volumetric feed rate were analyzed. The responses were the outlet air properties, physico-chemical characteristics of powders, the estimated droplet evaporation time and the additional exposure time of dry particles in the chamber. The droplet evaporation time was calculated by considering evaporation in still-air and drying only during the constant rate period. The calculated values were 69.67-105.98 ms and 1.45-2.74 s for TF-SD and SF-SD, respectively. The contact of product with hot air caused by back-mixing and the extended residence time in the chamber may explain the poor oxidative stability of powders from SF-SD. The peroxide index values were 1.72-4.51 and 16.10-96.65 meq. O2/kg oil for TF-SD and SF-SD, respectively. The oxidative stability indexes were 5.14-6.52 and 0.26-0.80 h for TF-SD and SF-SD, respectively. A global optimization was performed for TF-SD since it yielded products with the best chemical quality. The process condition that simultaneously optimized the responses was 160 °C*2.8 mL/min. Finally, additional characterization of the optimal powders ensured the stability of the core: fatty acid profile before and after in-vitro digestion, thermogravimetric analysis, differential scanning calorimetry, moisture sorption behavior and surface morphology.

Influence of fluidized-bed roasting conditions of white sesame seeds on the physico-chemical properties and sensory acceptability of the cold-pressed oils.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Sesame seeds have economic interest owing to their oil content (45%-60%, dry basis). A multilevel factorial design was created in order to analyze the effects of air temperature (120,150, and 180 °C) and roasting time (20,25, and 30 min) in a laboratory-scale fluidized-bed dryer. All treatments showed oil recovery values higher than 70%, except for roasting at 180 °C for 25 and 30 min. The roasting treatment at 180 °C for 20 min yielded oils with the best sensory properties and with acceptable values for chemical quality parameters: acid value (1.82 mg KOH/g oil), peroxides (not detected), oxidative stability index (11.58 hr), and antioxidants' content (total tocopherols: 410 ppm; total lignans: 9.54 g/kg oil). The combination of the seeds' roasting by fluidized-bed drying and oil extraction by screw-pressing, allowed obtaining high oil recoveries and products with high oxidative stability and sensory acceptability. Practical applications: Sesame oil is popular among healthy-food consumers given its bioactive components, mainly tocopherols and lignans, which confer a relatively high oxidative stability. Sesame seeds are roasted to change their microstructure for oil accumulation, to intensify flavor, and to increase the levels of antioxidants in the oil. Regarding the production of high-quality roasted oil, the roasting of sesame seeds in fluidized-bed dryers and the subsequent oil extraction in screw-presses have never been reported together. High oil recoveries and roasted sesame oils with a healthy physico-chemical composition, great oxidative stability, and sensory acceptability would be achieved by the oilseed industry through the use of two widely known technologies. First, fluidized-bed drying offers a high degree of mixing, and uniform heat and mass transfer over conventional direct heating methods for seed roasting. Second, screw-pressing of roasted seeds represents a green alternative to solvent extraction, mainly for specialty oils, because only mechanical power input is necessary to expel the oil. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Using black soldier fly larvae reared on fruits and vegetables waste as a sustainable dietary source of provitamin a carotenoids.		Food Chemistry					We showed that black soldier fly larvae reared on fruits and vegetables rich in provitamin A carotenoids can accumulate significant amounts of these vitamin A precursors. Using a simulated gastro-intestinal digestion model, we demonstrated that alpha- and beta-carotene from the larvae are as bioaccessible as from the fruits and vegetables they were reared on. We calculated that provitamin A carotenoid-rich larvae have the capacity to provide more vitamin A than fruits and vegetables rich in these molecules. Remarkably, the incorporation of usual quantities of these larvae in feed could cover the needs of several production animals for this vitamin. Thus, our findings suggest that rearing black soldier fly larvae on by-products or waste rich in provitamin A carotenoids could be a sustainable strategy to recycle a fraction of vitamin A back into the food chain and could represent a new approach to fight against vitamin A deficiency.

Beta-carotene bioavailability and conversion efficiency are significantly affected by sex in rats.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. To study the effect of variation in dietary vitamin A (VA) content on its hepatic and intestinal metabolism. Methods and Results. Adult female and male rats are fed with diets containing 400,2300, or 9858 IU kg-1 VA for 31-33 weeks. VA concentrations are measured in plasma and liver. Bioavailability and intestinal conversion efficiency of beta-carotene to VA are assessed by measuring postprandial plasma beta-carotene and retinyl palmitate concentrations after force-feeding rats with beta-carotene. Expression of genes involved in VA metabolism, together with concentrations of RBP4, BCO1, and SR-BI proteins, are measured in the intestine and liver of female rats. Plasma retinol concentrations are lower and hepatic free retinol concentrations are higher in females than in males. There is no effect of dietary VA content on beta-carotene bioavailability and its conversion efficiency, but bioavailability is higher and conversion efficiency is lower in females than in males. The expression of most genes exhibited a U-shaped dose response curve depending on VA intake. Conclusions. beta-Carotene bioavailability and conversion efficiency to VA are affected by the sex of rats. Results of gene expression suggest a hormetic regulation of VA metabolism in female rats. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Based on previous research where near-UV Visible spectroscopy was used to investigate extra-virgin olive oils (EVOOs) and their main pigments' content (i.e., beta-carotene, lutein, pheophytin a and pheophytin b), we have implemented the spectral deconvolution method in order to follow the EVOO's life, from "freshly pressed" to "on-the-shelf" EVOO samples at different storage time. In the first part of the manuscript, the new implemented deconvolution spectroscopic method aimed to quantify two additional pigments, namely chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, is described and tested on "ad hoc" samples with known concentrations of chlorophylls. The effect of light exposure and acidification was investigated to test the reliability and robustness of the spectral deconvolution. In the second part of the work, this approach was used to study the kinetic of pigments" degradation in several monocultivar fresh EVOO samples under optimal storage's conditions. The results here reported show that this spectroscopic deconvolution approach is a good method to study fresh EVOOs too; moreover, the proposed method revealed to be sensitive to detect eventual stresses of olive oil samples stored in not-good conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Borges, M. S.; Biz, A. P.; Bertolo, A. P.; Bagatini, L.; Rigo, E.; Cavalheiro, D.							Enriched cereal bars with wine fermentation biomass.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cereal bars are a sweet-tasting, nutritious, and enjoyable source of vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Ingredients can be added to the formulation to improve certain characteristics, such as protein content. Some of these ingredients are derived from yeast from fermentation processes. This study aimed to add value to the residue resulting from the wine fermentation process (wine lees) by applying it in the formulation of cereal bars. Results. Three formulations of cereal bars with different concentrations of autolyzed yeast biomass were developed. The effect of the addition of biomass was investigated by chemical and sensorial analysis. The cereal bar with the highest concentration of autolyzed biomass (5%) showed the highest protein content (73.4 gkg-1). The findings regarding acceptance obtained by sensory analysis showed that the samples with 2.5% and 5% autolyzed biomass pleased consumers. Conclusions. Formulations of autolyzed biomass-based cereal bars have increased protein content as the autolyzed biomass concentration has increased. Moreover, the acceptance of the cereal bars with autolyzed biomass in concentrations of 2.5% and 5% was satisfactory. The use of wine lees in food products is therefore a possible way of adding value to this residue, including, for example, a significant increase in protein. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Integrated green-based methods to recover bioactive compounds from by-product of acerola processing.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to recover bioactive compounds from by-product of acerola processing. Firstly, hydrothermal treatment was carried out to extract the compounds, and later, it was concentrated by nanofiltration (NF). Central Composite Rotational Design associated with response surface methodology was applied to maximize the extraction. The optimal conditions were 15 min and a liquid-solid ratio of 22 mL/g (water/non-pomace). The optimized extract was concentrated in NF by a volumetric factor of 13-fold to provide a concentrated product with characteristics compatible with acerola juice. The concentration resulted in the following retentions (R%) and concentration factors (CF): 94.9% and 9.2 for total phenolic content (TPC), 91.6% and 4.9 for ascorbic acid (AA), 99.0% and 8.0 for antioxidant compounds, respectively. NF membrane also showed retention higher than 90.0% for catechin, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and rutin. TPC and antioxidant activity found in the concentrated extract was 1.3 and 1.5-fold higher than the acerola juice, respectively. The AA content in the extract was below the value found in the juice, 7.9 and 9.1 mg/mL, respectively. Finally, the hydrothermal treatment resulted in higher extraction of phenolic compounds compared to conventional extraction, and its integration with NF resulted in a high content of bioactive compounds.

Production of gluten free bread with flour and chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L).		Food Bioscience					The need for gluten-free products on the market due to the growing increase in the celiac population, which requires a gluten-free diet, becomes a challenge for Food Technology to develop gluten-free and quality foods. This study aimed to develop and evaluate gluten-free bread with the addition of chia seed or chia flour. Gluten-free bread formulations were developed where 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10% chia seed or flour were added, based on rice flour, and were then evaluated for proximal composition and physical, technological, and sensory characteristics. The addition of chia flour and chia seed to gluten-free bread provided a significant increase (greater than 70%) in protein content, improving its nutritional quality. The addition of chia seed had a beneficial effect on the specific volume of the bread, as well as a higher total score. The bread added with chia flour showed greater firmness and less loss of mass during baking. In the sensory evaluation, gluten-free bread with 4% chia flour and 6% chia seed did not differ from the control bread, being well accepted by consumers. Therefore, the addition of chia contributed positively to gluten-free bread, providing more nutritious and good quality food.

J		Borgonovi, T. F.; Casarotti, S. N.; Penna, A. L. B.							Lacticaseibacillus casei SJRP38 and buriti pulp increased bioactive compounds and probiotic potential of fermented milk.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of passion fruit and buriti pulps on probiotic and starter lactic acid bacteria growth and on fermented milk (FM) was evaluated. Buriti pulp showed higher amounts of lipids, total phenolic compounds (PC), beta-carotene, lycopene and antioxidant activity (AA) than passion fruit. However, passion fruit was used more efficiently as a carbon source by all strains. Lacticaseibacillus casei SJRP38 showed the best results in the presence of passion fruit (1.8 log CFU/mL increase compared to the initial population) and the lowest reduction in the presence of buriti, thus it was selected to produce FM. Acidified milk (AM) with the same fruit pulps was used as a control. The buriti pulp did not affect the kinetic parameters of FM compared to the control. However, the addition of fruit pulps increased the PC in both FM and AM, and FM showed a greater increase (33.4-141.6%) than AM (21.4%-87.9%). Also, buriti pulp was able to increase (6-8%) the AA of the FM when compared to the AM. FM with buriti pulp stood out for its high amount of total PC, which indicates its high potential to be used as a functional food. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Cold plasma hydrophilization of soy protein isolate and milk protein concentrate enables manufacturing of surfactant-free water suspensions. Part I: hydrophilization of food powders using cold plasma.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					In this study, we found that treatment with cold plasma influenced the wetting properties of soy protein isolate and milk protein concentrate powders. Cold plasma treatment significantly decreased the apparent contact angle of the powders, indicating hydrophilization of the powders. Cold radiofrequency low-pressure plasma treatment had a larger effect on powder wettability than corona atmospheric plasma discharge. In addition, cold plasma treatment had a more noticeable effect on the wettability of the hydrophobic milk protein concentrate than on the inherently hydrophilic soy protein isolate. Both the soy protein isolate and milk protein concentrate demonstrated zero hydrophobic recovery over time. Scanning electron microscopy showed that cold air plasma treatment of food powders caused minor surface oxidation, though these changes were not observed using FTIR spectroscopy. We suggest that cold plasma treatment has important implications for the production of stabilizer-free food suspensions.

Bisht							A comprehensive Vis-NIRS equation for rapid quantification of seed glucosinolate content and composition across diverse Brassica oilseed chemotypes.		Food Chemistry					The globally cultivated Brassica crops contain high deliverable concentrations of health-promoting glucosinolates. Development of a Visible-Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) calibration to profile different glucosinolate components from 641 diverse Brassica juncea chemotypes was attempted in this study. Principal component analysis of HPLC-determined glucosinolates established the distinctiveness of four B. juncea populations used. Subsequently, modified partial least square regression based population-specific and combined Vis-NIRS models were developed, wherein the combined model exhibited higher coefficient of determination (R2; 0.81-0.97) for eight glucosinolates and higher ratio of prediction determination (RPD; 2.42-5.35) for seven glucosinolates in B. juncea populations. Furthermore, range error ratio (RER > 4) for twelve and RER > 10 for eight glucosinolates make the combined model acceptable for screening and quality control. The model also provided excellent prediction for aliphatic glucosinolates in four oilseed Brassica species. Overall, our work highlights the potential of Vis-NIR spectroscopy in estimating glucosinolate content in the economically important Brassica oilseeds.

J		Borne, B. H. P. van den; Grinsven, N. J. M. van; Hogeveen, H.							Trends in somatic cell count deteriorations in Dutch dairy herds transitioning to an automatic milking system.		Journal of Dairy Science					Udder health is at risk when herds transition from a conventional milking system (CMS) to an automatic milking system (AMS). Somatic cell counts (SCC) are generally elevated for several months following a transition. However, such observations were made in studies conducted in the early 2000s. Technical improvements to AMS have likely been made since then, and farm management may have improved, learning from past experiences. This longitudinal observational study quantified national trends in SCC deteriorations in dairy herds that transitioned from a CMS to an AMS. Census data from the Dutch test day recording was used to determine these trends. It consisted of all cow-level SCC measurements conducted in the Netherlands from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2019. Three udder health indicators, including the natural logarithm of the yield-corrected bulk-milk SCC, the proportion of cows having a composite SCC ≥200,000 cells/mL, and the proportion of cows having a new elevated SCC, were evaluated using multivariable population-averaged generalized estimation equations. Predicted values resulting from these statistical models were interpreted to determine trends in SCC deteriorations from 12 mo before and 12 mo after the transition to an AMS. Decreasing SCC deteriorations were observed during the study period for all 3 udder health indicators. Udder health deteriorations around the transition to an AMS were still observed, but they decreased in magnitude over the course of the study period. Bulk-milk SCC deteriorations were, for instance, 2.5 times lower in 2019 compared with those observed in 2007. Therefore, the effect of transitioning to an AMS on udder health became less severe in more recent years. However, deteriorations in the proportion of new SCC elevations were still evident toward the end of the study period. Efforts to lower udder health deteriorations in herds that transition to an AMS should therefore be continued and should intensify on factors lowering the proportion of cows having a new elevated SCC.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The growing demand for the consumption of more natural products challenges the food industry to meet consumer expectations. In this regard, bioactive peptides obtained from flavourzyme, bromelain and alcalase activity were added to pork patties with the aim of improving their shelf-life. Five treatments were prepared: control (CON, without enzymatic extract), positive control (ASA, with 150mgkg-1 of ascorbic acid) and three batches with 250mgkg-1 of different porcine liver hydrolysates [flavourzyme (FLA), bromelain (BRO) and alcalase (ALC)]. The analysis of raw burgers included proximate composition (moisture, protein, fat and ash contents), colour parameters (L*, a*, b*), metmyoglobin, lipid oxidation, volatile compounds profile and sensory evaluation. Hydrolysate obtained from bromelain enzyme showed the best a* parameter (5.15), the least lipid oxidation (0.63mg MDAkg-1) and the lowest percentage of metmyoglobin (56.02%). Furthermore, this batch also presented the lowest content of aldehydes and alcohols resulting from lipid oxidation. Our results suggested that the hydrolysates obtained from bromelain activity possessed a good antioxidative activity, and therefore, they could be used as a natural antioxidant to extend the shelf-life of pork burgers. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Borras, D.; Plazas, M.; Moglia, A.; Lanteri, S.							The influence of acute water stresses on the biochemical composition of bell pepper (Capsicum annuumL.) berries.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Crops are exposed to recurrent and acute drought stress episodes during their vegetative and reproductive cycles, and these episodes are increasingly frequent due to ongoing climate change. Sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum), alias bell pepper, is one of the most widely cultivated vegetables and is grown in open fields worldwide. Here we assessed the effect of acute water stress, applied to a breeding line of sweet pepper at three stages of plant development: five true-leaves (Stage 1), production of the third flower (Stage 2) and setting of the first fruit (Stage 3), on the production and biochemical composition of its ripe fruits. Results. The water stress at Stages 1 and 2 induced a delay in fruit ripening, while at Stage 3 caused a drop in production. The biochemical composition of ripe fruits was assessed by quantifying their content in vitamin C, sugars, organic acids, flavonoids as well as 190 volatile organic compounds, mainly belonging to the chemical classes of hydrocarbons, alcohols, ketones, esters, terpenes, aldehydes and ethers. Our results highlight that, at different stages of plant development, acute water stresses modulate differently the accumulation of bioactive compounds in fruits, which play a key role in setting the redox-status and osmotic adjustment of the plant. This was also the case for volatile compounds since, within each chemical class, different compounds varied their content in ripe fruits. Conclusions. On the whole, our results demonstrate that water stresses potentially affect the organoleptic and sensory qualities of bell pepper fruits depending on when they occur. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The objective of this research was to develop novel oleogels based on pumpkin seed oil and natural waxes. Crystallization and gelation of 4, 5, 6 and 8% of beeswax and carnauba wax in pumpkin seed oil were investigated, and their physical properties were evaluated using an oleogel prepared with sunflower oil and beeswax as reference. In order to obtain a complete three-dimensional network, after a cooling stage a setting stage was necessary at 25 °C for no longer than 60 min. Oleogels produced with pumpkin seed oil and beeswax were weaker than those made with sunflower seeds; pumpkin seed oil-based oleogels structured by carnauba wax presented higher viscoelastic properties, retained more oil and were firmer than oleogels based on beeswax. Based on scaling theory, all the oleogels followed a strong-link regime and the fractal dimension of the network (D) was comparable to fats widely used in food production. Therefore, pumpkin seed oil can be used to create novel oleogels. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	152				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.112165					FSTA:2022-02-Ae2289

Foods					The reuse of food industry by-products constitutes one of the essential pillars of the change from a linear to a circular economic model. Drying is one of the most affordable techniques with which to stabilize by-products, making their subsequent processing possible. However, it can affect material properties. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of the drying temperature on the drying kinetics and final quality of the main artichoke processing by-products, bracts and stems, which have never been studied as independent materials. For this purpose, air drying experiments at different temperatures (40, 60, 80,100 and 120 °C) were carried out. The alcohol insoluble residue (AIR) and the total phenolic content (TPC), antioxidant capacity (AC) and vitamin C (VC) of the fresh and dried samples were determined. The bracts dried faster than the stems, increasing drying rate with temperature. The two by-products presented relatively large amounts of AIR, the content being higher in bracts, but better functional properties in stems. The TPC, AC and VC values of the dried samples decreased in relation to the fresh samples, with the temperatures of 40 °C (bracts) and 120 °C (stems) being the most adequate for the purposes of preserving these characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Research International					This study was carried out to assess the occurrence of antimicrobial residues in samples of tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fillets collected at the State of Sao Paulo retail market and produced from fish farmed in Brazil. For this purpose, a liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was validated and used to quantify residues of 25 antibacterial drugs (2 beta-lactams, 8 quinolones, 2 macrolides, 5 sulfonamides, 4 tetracyclines, 3 amphenicols and 1 sulfonamide potentiator). For the sample preparation step the QuEChERS approach was performed. Chromatographic separation was conducted using a Zorbax SB C18 column. Method validation was performed based on European and Brazilian guidelines. The validation parameters (linearity, intra-and inter-day precision, accuracy, decision limit, detection capability and robustness) attended the adopted validation guidelines. Limits of detection and quantitation were also determined. Antimicrobial drug residues were quantitated in the incurred samples by using matrix-matched analytical curves. Oxytetracycline, florfenicol and, for the first time, enrofloxacin residues are reported in tilapia fillet samples from Brazil, though, in accordance with the European and Brazilian regulatory framework. Thus, our results draw attention to the use of veterinary products in fish farming in Brazil. Monitoring of veterinary drug residues is essential to ensure the safety of fish products available to the consumer, as well as to keep fish as a food commodity. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Borui Li; Katrina Cornish; Zhian Zheng; Min Wu							Physicochemical properties and rheological behavior of chrysanthemum powder made by superfine grinding and high pressure homogenization.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The effects of superfine grinding on the properties of chrysanthemum powder (CP) and high pressure homogenization (HPH) on the rheological properties of CP suspensions were investigated. Superfine grinding reduced particle size to a D50 of 28.45mum. Instantaneous flow function and wall friction tests demonstrated that superfine ground CP had poor flowability and was more cohesive than more coarsely ground samples. Superfine grinding increased thermal stability and reduced the crystallinity of CP. After HPH treatment, the apparent viscosity and consistency coefficient (k, from 0.0270.005 to 1.8470.472) of CP suspension was significantly improved (p<.05), indicating that HPH treatment increased the consistency and reduced the fluidity of CP suspensions. As the HPH pressure increased from 40 to 120MPa, the storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G) of the CP suspensions increased, which fitted well with the Power Law model (R2>.961). The CP suspension is a non-Newtonian fluid with shear thinning behavior. Flow and rheological characteristics are measured under different consolidation pressures and HPH pressures, respectively. These findings reveal the potential application of superfine grinding and high pressure homogenization in the development of CP. Practical application. The use of superfine grinding and high pressure homogenization to process CP has broad application prospects, such as the preparation of micronized Chinese medicinal powders in the pharmaceutical industry and functional foods and beverages in the food industry. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	4			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13652					FSTA:2021-08-Ge4266
J		Boruo Yang; Tao Chen; Huanjian Li; Yanqing Li; Runan Yang							Impact of postmortem degradation of cytoskeletal proteins on intracellular gap, drip channel and water-holding capacity.		Meat Science					The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the degradation of cytoskeletal proteins (desmin, integrin, vinculin, and talin) on the formation of intracellular gap and drip channel and water-holding capacity in pork. The intensity of intact cytoskeletal proteins and the width of intracellular gap and drip channel were measured in high drip loss and low drip loss groups. The data indicate that the width of intracellular gap and drip channel explained 17% and 62% variation in drip loss, respectively, while the intensity of intact desmin, integrin, and vinculin explained 47%, 34%, and 47% variation in drip loss, respectively. The postmortem formation of intracellular gap is mainly affected by the changes in integrin and vinculin, while the formation of the drip channel is influenced by the changes in desmin. These findings suggest that postmortem formation of wide intracellular gap and drip channels is linked to increased drip loss.

Protein extraction protocols for optimal proteome measurement and arginine kinase quantitation from cricket Acheta domesticus for food safety assessment.		Food Chemistry					Insects have been consumed by people for millennia and have recently been proposed as a complementary, sustainable source of protein to feed the world's growing population. Insects and crustaceans both belong to the arthropod family. Crustacean (shellfish) allergies are common and potentially severe; hence, the cross-reactivity of the immune system with insect proteins is a potential health concern. Herein, LC-MS/MS was used to explore the proteome of whole, roasted whole and roasted powdered cricket products. Eight protein extraction protocols were compared using the total number of protein and distinct peptide identifications. Within these data, 20 putative allergens were identified, of which three were arginine kinase (AK) proteoforms. Subsequently, a multiple reaction monitoring MS assay was developed for the AK proteoforms and applied to a subset of extracts. This targeted assay demonstrated that allergen abundance/detectability varies according to the extraction method as well as the food processing method. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A rapid, high-throughput method for the quantitation of the 2-acetyl azaheterocycles, 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-acetyl-1, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydropyridine, 2-acetylpyrazine, and 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline, in different food products, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), was developed. The quick extraction by bead beater homogenization, fast derivatization by 3-nitrophenylhydrazine (40 °C, 2 h), and efficient LC separation make this method suitable for high-throughput analysis. As established in this study, the highly precise LC-MS/MS method applies to different food products or beverages without requiring further adjustment. The analysis was performed with sample amounts of 0.2-0.5 g, and limit of quantitation values of 0.6, 0.5, 0.6, and 1.0 mug/kg were obtained for 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, 2-acetyl-1, 4, 5, 6-tetrahydropyridine, 2-acetylpyrazine, and 2-acetyl-2-thiazoline, respectively. Thus, it was possible to quantitate the analytes in the range of their odor thresholds.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Coffee is a very popular and highly traded commodity that is targeted by fraudulent practices, affecting global production and economy. A common practice involves the substitution of the more expensive Arabica coffee with the less popular Robusta. Various physiochemical and DNA-based technologies have been used for coffee authentication; yet detection of adulterants in coffee still faces limitations in terms of the raw material used, the level of processing, and the sensitivity of available analytical tools. Additionally, DNA-based methodologies cannot be successfully used in the presence of strong inhibitors in brewed coffee. Herein, we designed an Internal Transcribed Spacer region 2 (ITS2)-based marker that allowed coffee authentication, even from the brewed beverage, when coupled with High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis. The developed methodology could effectively detect differences in Arabica/Robusta admixtures, as low as 1% (v/v) DNA content. Direct species identification from the brewed beverage was enabled by the use of an inhibitor-tolerant DNA polymerase with enhanced sensitivity, without prior DNA purification. In the context of food safety, this novel approach could advance coffee authentication methods for safeguarding coffee producers and consumers. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bosoon Park; Bin Wang; Jing Chen							Label-free immunoassay for multiplex detections of foodborne bacteria in chicken carcass rinse with surface plasmon resonance imaging.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					The frequent outbreaks of foodborne pathogens have stimulated the demand of biosensors capable of rapid and multiplex detection of contaminated food. In this study, surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi) was used in simultaneous label-free detection of multiple foodborne pathogens, mainly Salmonella spp. and Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli (STEC), in commercial chicken carcass rinse. The antibodies were immobilized on the same SPRi sensor chip as a label-free immunoassay. Their immobilization concentrations were optimized to be ranging from 0.25 to 1.0 mg/mL, and independent of pH values. This label-free immunoassay achieved 106 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL limit of detection for Salmonella, which was further improved to 1.0 CFU/mL with overnight bacteria enrichment. The injected samples with different bacteria, Salmonella serotype Enteritidis, STEC, and Listeria monocytogenes, have been identified by the same biochip. Moreover, the SPRi signals revealed complex interference effects among coexisting bacteria species in heterogeneous bacteria solutions. This SPRi-based immunoassay demonstrates the great potential in high-throughput screening of multiple pathogenic bacteria coexisting in chicken carcass rinse. The reliability of antibody immobilization and cross-reactions of different antibodies on the same biochip are the major challenges of practical application of SPRi.										2021	18	3	202	209	1535-3141				10.1089/fpd.2020.2850					FSTA:2021-08-Sn4474

Description of the temporal dynamics in microbial community composition and beer chemistry in sour beer production via barrel ageing of finished beers.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Currently, there is a strong interest in barrel ageing of finished, conventionally fermented beers, as a novel way to produce sour beers with a rich and complex flavour profile. The production process, however, remains largely a process of trial and error, often resulting in profit losses and inconsistency in quality. To improve product quality and consistency, a better understanding of the interactions between microorganisms, wood and maturing beer is needed. The aim of this study was to describe the temporal dynamics in microbial community composition, beer chemistry and sensory characteristics during barrel ageing of three conventionally fermented beers that differed in parameters like alcohol content and bitterness. Beers were matured for 38 weeks in new (two types of wood) and used (one type of wood) oak barrels. Beer samples were taken at the start of the maturation and after 2,12 and 38 weeks. Microbial community composition, determined using amplicon sequencing of the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and the fungal ITS1 region, beer chemistry and sensory characteristics substantially changed throughout the maturation process. Likewise, total bacterial and fungal population densities generally increased during maturation. PerMANOVA revealed significant differences in the bacterial and fungal community composition of the three beers and across time points, but not between the different wood types. By contrast, significant differences in beer chemistry were found across the different beers, wood types and sampling points. Results also indicated that the outcome of the maturation process likely depends on the initial beer properties. Specifically, results suggested that beer bitterness may restrain the bacterial community composition, thereby having an impact on beer souring. While the bacterial community composition of moderately-hopped beers shifted to a dominance of lactic acid bacteria, the bacterial community of the high-bitterness beer remained fairly constant, with low population densities. Bacterial community composition of the moderate-bitterness beers also resembled those of traditional sours like lambic beers, hosting typical lambic brewing species like Pediococcus damnosus, Lactobacillus brevis and Acetobacter sp. Furthermore, results suggested that alcohol level may have affected the fungal community composition and extraction of wood compounds. More specifically, the concentration of wood compounds like cis-3-methyl-4-octanolide, trans-3-methyl-4-octanolide, eugenol and total polyphenols was higher in beers with a high alcohol content. Altogether, our results provide novel insights into the barrel ageing process of beer, and may pave the way for a new generation of sour beers.

J		Bosse, R.; Wirth, M.; Weiss, J.; Gibis, M.							Effect of storage temperature on volatile marker compounds in cured loins fermented with Staphylococcus carnosus by brine injection.		European Food Research and Technology					In this study, the influence of low (5 °C), intermediate (15 °C) and high (25 °C) storage temperatures on the profile of volatile compounds of North European cured loins fermented with Staphylococcus carnosus strains was investigated. In this context, proteolytic activity, bacterial growth, key volatile compounds and sensory attributes were studied. In conclusion, storage temperature significantly affected the volatile marker compounds. A multiple regression indicated significant effects of seven volatile compounds (acetophenone, benzaldehyde, butanone, 3-methylbutanal, 1-octen-3-ol, nonanal and pentanone) on the overall odor (R2=95.9%) and overall flavor (R2=81.1%). The sum of the marker volatiles aldehydes, ketones and alcohol increased with rising temperatures and the highest amounts of the odor active 3-methylbutanal up to 155 and 166 ng/g meat were detected in high temperature-stored loins. Moreover, the addition of S. carnosus strain LTH 3838 showed maximum effect at 5 °C-storage temperature in comparison to the control. ©The Author(s) 2020.										2021	247	1	233	244	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-020-03621-w					FSTA:2021-04-Sa2441

Assessment of chemical, physicochemical, and lipid stability properties of gelled emulsions elaborated with different oils chia (salvia hispanica l.) or hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) and pseudocereals.		Foods					Gelled emulsion (GE) systems are one of the novel proposals for the reformulation of meat products with healthier profiles. The aims of this research were (i) to develop gelled emulsions using pseudocereal flours (amaranth, buckwheat, teff, and quinoa) and vegetable oils (chia oil, hemp oil, and their combination), (ii) to determine their chemical composition, physicochemical properties, and lipid stability, and (iii) to evaluate their stability during frozen storage. The results showed that GEs are technologically viable except for the sample elaborated with teff flour and a mix of oils. The lipid oxidation was not greater than 2.5 mg malonaldehyde/kg of sample for any of the samples analyzed. The physicochemical properties analyzed showed both the pH and color values of the GEs within the range of values obtained for the fat of animal origin. The texture properties were affected by the type of oil added; in general, the firmness and the work of shear increased with the addition of the mixture of both oils. The samples elaborated with buckwheat and chia oil and quinoa and chia oil had the highest emulsion stability values, which remained among the highest after freezing. The results showed that gelled emulsions, based on chia oil, hemp, and their mixture with pseudocereal flours, are a viable alternative as a possible substitute of saturated fat in the development of novel foods. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Botella-Martinez, C.; Viuda-Martos, M.; Perez-Alvarez, J.; Fernandez-Lopez, J.							Total and partial fat replacement by gelled emulsion (hemp oil and buckwheat flour) and its impact on the chemical, technological and sensory properties of frankfurters.		Foods					A gelled emulsion (GE) prepared with hemp oil and buckwheat flour was used to replace pork back fat in frankfurters. Five different formulations were prepared: control (with 35% pork back fat-SC), and the following four to achieve 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% pork back fat substitution by GE (S1, S2, S3, and S4, respectively). Nutritional, technological, and sensorial characteristics of frankfurters were evaluated. Sausages containing GE presented a lower total fat content with a higher amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids, increased omega 3 content, and reduced saturated fat by up to 55%. The incorporation of GE did not significantly modify technological properties such as emulsion stability or lipid oxidation in spite of using vegetable oils highly susceptible to oxidation. The reformulation of the frankfurters presented a greater effect on the texture and sensory properties when GE was used as total substitution for the pork back fat (S4). When GE was used only as partial substitution for the pork back fat, sausages similar to control frankfurter were obtained. So this study demonstrated that the use of GE could be a promising strategy in the reformulation of healthier meat products. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

A.; Fernandez-Lopez, J.; Viuda-Martos, M.							Cocoa coproducts-based and walnut oil gelled emulsion as animal fat replacer and healthy bioactive source in beef burgers.		Foods					The aim of this work was to evaluate the effects on the chemical, physic-chemical, technological, and sensory properties of beef burger when replacing different quantities of fat (50 and 100%) with different levels of oil-in-water-gelled emulsion elaborated with walnut oil and cocoa bean shell flour (GECW). The chemical composition of the samples was affected by the fat replacement. The reformulation increased the moisture and ash content while the fat and protein content decreased with respect to the control sample. The linolenic and linolenic acid content of the beef burgers increased as the GECW replacement was augmented. The polyunsaturated fatty/saturated fatty acid ratio increased in both raw and cooked burgers, whereas the atherogenicity index and thrombogenicity index were reduced in both raw and cooked burgers with respect to the control sample. The use of GECW as a fat replacer was found to be effective in improving the cooking loss. Similarly, there were positive effects on reductions in the diameter and the increases in the thickness of the beef burgers. Regarding lipid stability, in both the raw and cooked burgers, the reformulation increased the 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARs) values with respect to the control sample. In both types of reformulated burgers, three bound polyphenols (mainly catechin and epicatechin) and two free polyphenols were identified, as were methylxanthines theobromine and caffeine. The sensory properties for the control and partial pork backfat replacement treatments were similar, while the sample with the total pork backfat replacement treatment showed the lowest scores. The blend of cocoa bean shell flour and walnut oil could be used as new ingredients for the development of beef burgers with a healthier nutritional profile without demeriting their sensory or cooking characteristics and physic-chemical properties. © 2021 by the authors.

The influence of the interaction of sous-vide cooking time and papain concentration on tenderness and technological characteristics of meat products.		Meat Science					The food industry has been slow in harnessing technological developments to expand opportunities and benefit the community. One such opportunity is in the application of proteolytic enzymes to the development of softer-textured meat products that require reduced mastication force, for those with impaired dentition, and reduced strength including older adults. Proteolytic enzymes haven't been fully explored for their potential in this area. Here a response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to model the interactive effects of sous-vide and papain application on texture, color, and cooking loss of meat. An innovative meat product formulation with a reduced toughness (120 min cooking sous-vide and 0.01 mg papain/100 g) was optimized and the technological performance of the formulation was validated. Bias values of the optimized model were in the range of 0.97 to 1.06, while accuracy factors for shear force values, chewiness, TPA hardness, cooking loss, color parameters ranged from 1.00 and 1.06, both of which metrics indicated the reliability of the resultant models.

J		Botosoa, E. P.; Chene, C.; Karoui, R.							Front face fluorescence spectroscopy combined with PLS-DA allows to monitor chemical changes of edible vegetable oils during storage at 60 °C.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					In this work, front-face fluorescence spectroscopy coupled with chemometric tools are used for the monitoring of rapeseed, sunflower, extra virgin olive, and linseed oil. The oil samples are heated at 60 °C for up to 15 days. The fluorescence excitation spectra are scanned in the range of 270-420 nm and 250-310 nm after emission wavelength set at 450 and 330 nm, respectively. The primary and secondary lipid oxidation products are also determined on the same oil samples. By applying partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to each spectral collection obtained after emission set at 450 and 330 nm, clear discrimination of edible oil samples according to their botanical types, and sometimes aging, is obtained. Practical Applications. This study shows that oxidation of rapeseed, sunflower, extra virgin olive, and linseed oil monitored different trends due to their difference in composition. The presented results demonstrated the capability of the front-face fluorescence spectroscopy to differentiate four vegetable oils contained in capped and uncapped flasks indicating the evolution of primary and secondary indicators of oxidation during the storage period. The technology can be exploited at the industrial level for monitoring in a non-destructive manner the level of oxidation of edible oil. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.			karoui, Romdhane/0000-0003-3896-6081							2021	123	6			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000088					FSTA:2021-10-Ne2224

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic very rapidly at the beginning of 2020. In the rush to possible therapeutic options, probiotics administration has been proposed mainly based on indirect observation. Some evidence of COVID-19 effects on intestinal microbiota dysbiosis has been shown and probiotics have been considered for their efficacy in the management of respiratory tract viral infections. These observations could be reinforced by the more and more evident existence of a lung-gut axis, suggesting the modulation of gut microbiota among the approaches to the COVID-19 prevention and treatment. As different possible roles of probiotics in this extremely severe illness have been contemplated, the aim of this work is to collect all the currently available information related to this topic, providing a starting point for future studies focussing on it. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.		bottari, benedetta/L-1938-2013	bottari, benedetta/0000-0001-6534-2341; Castellone, Vincenzo/0000-0002-3479-9231							2021	72	3	293	299	0963-7486				10.1080/09637486.2020.1807475					FSTA:2021-08-Ad11524

Understanding the effect of storage temperature on the quality of semi-skimmed UHT hydrolyzed-lactose milk: an insight on release of free amino acids, formation of volatiles organic compounds and browning.		Food Research International					Proteolytic side activity of the lactase preparations (LPs) intended for ultra-high temperature hydrolyzed-lactose milk (UHLM) production induces changes in the product quality during shelf-life. The problem is particularly relevant when the enzyme is added aseptically in the packaging ("in pack" process), while the negative quality effects can be mitigated following the "in batch" process adding the LP before thermal sterilization. In this study, we monitored the quality over time of UHLM produced "in batch" and stored at 4,20, 30 and 40 °C focusing on proteolysis, volatiles organic compounds (VOCs) formation and color changes. The goal was to identify the key reactions and compounds relevant for the product quality. An increase in storage temperature determined significant changes in the free amino acids profile increasing Strecker aldehydes and methyl ketones formation. At 30 and 40 °C, Maillard reaction and lipid oxidation ended up in a modification of the milk color, whereas at 4 and 20 °C no significant alteration was observed. Altogether, the results suggested a coordinate involvement of Maillard reaction, protein and lipid oxidation to milk browning and off-flavors formation in UHLM. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Upstream regulator analysis of wooden breast myopathy proteomics in commercial broilers and comparison to feed efficiency proteomics in pedigree male broilers.		Foods					In an effort to understand the apparent trade-off between the continual push for growth performance and the recent emergence of muscle pathologies, shotgun proteomics was conducted on breast muscle obtained at ~8 weeks from commercial broilers with wooden breast (WB) myopathy and compared with that in pedigree male (PedM) broilers exhibiting high feed efficiency (FE). Comparison of the two proteomic datasets was facilitated using the overlay function of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen, CA, USA). We focused on upstream regulator analysis and disease-function analysis that provides predictions of activation or inhibition of molecules based on (a) expression of downstream target molecules, (b) the IPA scientific citation database. Angiopoeitin 2 (ANGPT2) exhibited the highest predicted activation Z-score of all molecules in the WB dataset, suggesting that the proteomic landscape of WB myopathy would promote vascularization. Overlaying the FE proteomics data on the WB ANGPT2 upstream regulator network presented no commonality of protein expression and no prediction of ANGPT2 activation. Peroxisome proliferator coactivator 1 alpha (PGC1alpha) was predicted to be inhibited, suggesting that mitochondrial biogenesis was suppressed in WB. PGC1alpha was predicted to be activated in high FE pedigree male broilers. Whereas RICTOR (rapamycin independent companion of mammalian target of rapamycin) was predicted to be inhibited in both WB and FE datasets, the predictions were based on different downstream molecules. Other transcription factors predicted to be activated in WB muscle included epidermal growth factor (EGFR), X box binding protein (XBP1), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NFE2L2). Inhibitions of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), AHR nuclear translocator (ARNT) and estrogen related receptor gamma (ESRRG) were also predicted in the WB muscle. These findings indicate that there are considerable differences in upstream regulators based on downstream protein expression observed in WB myopathy and in high FE PedM broilers that may provide additional insight into the etiology of WB myopathy. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation of nutritional composition and ecotoxicity of the stick insect Cladomorphus phyllinum.		European Food Research and Technology					The global population is estimated to reach 9 billion at 2050; thus, there will be an increase of food demand. In this scenario, edible insects can be considered as an option for both food and supplements source. In this work was evaluated the nutritional aspects of Cladomorphus phyllinum, also known as stick insect. Protein, carbohydrates, amino acids, lipids, fatty acids, minerals and ecotoxicity were analyzed. The raw sample had protein, carbohydrate, ester and lipid content of 17.96%, 8.33%, 15.23% and 1.85%, respectively, while the dry sample presented 64.6% protein content. It has been found that the dry stick insect presented the essential amino acids, leucine, isoleucine, valine, lysine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine and histidine. Oleic acid (57.03%), palmitic acid (15.94%), linoleic acid (13.76%) and stearic acid (10.67%) were also found in dry samples. The micronutrients calcium, magnesium and zinc were the minerals with expressive concentrations. Besides, acute ecotoxicity tests performed with extremely sensitive species, Daphnia magna, Vibrio fischeri and Artemia Salina, revealed no toxicity associated with the Cladomorphus phyllinum. These results obtained in this work indicate that the stick insect can be used as an alternative insect-based protein, minerals, fatty acids and amino source. ©Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Royal jelly alleviates the detrimental effects of aging on immune functions by enhancing the in vitro cellular proliferation, cytokines, and nitric oxide release in aged human PBMCS.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Aging strongly delays the immunity. Our research aims to assess the in vitro effects of royal jelly (RJ) on the immune function of aged PBMCs. PBMCs were obtained from 10 healthy aged and young donors by the gradient density centrifugation method and further cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with or without RJ in the presence of Con A. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay along with the measurement of interleukins, Nitric oxide (NO), Glutathione (GSH), and Malondialdehydes (MDA). Our results showed that RJ improved PBMCs proliferation significantly in the elderly subjects, accompanied by the increase in NO (p=.001) and the release of IL-2, IL-4, and IL-6 cytokines. RJ also increased the intracellular GSH (p =.001) and MDA (p=.001) levels in aged PBMCs. In young subjects, RJ enhanced PBMCs proliferation potency, IL-4, IL-6, GSH, and intracellular MDA levels but with a concomitant decrease in NO and IL-2 cytokine secretion as compared with non RJ-treated cells. In conclusion, RJ restored functions of the aged PBMCs as well as the young control subjects, indicating a beneficial effect on immune status during the aging process. Practical applications. Royal jelly is a well-known edible dietary compound, used traditionally to treat many diseases throughout the world. Since antiquity, it was shown to have medicinal importance. The immuno-enhancing potential of this food was largely and scientifically established by the lipid and protein fractions. The present study illustrates the anti-aging and stimulatory effects of the fresh RJ whole extract, from local Algerian honey bee: Apis mellifera intermissa, on the immunity of aged men.

Food Science & Nutrition					The study describes the transformation of mangoes of the local variety "Assabonou" and papaya solo No. 8 into alcohol and then into vinegar through the process of directed fermentation. Indeed, mango and papaya juices extracted from ripe fruits contained in vials are first subjected to an alcoholic fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae in anaerobic conditions and secondly to an acetic fermentation with strains of acetic acid bacteria cultivated from unpasteurized cider vinegar. To assess the quality of the vinegars produced, their profile and composition in organic acid and volatile compounds were compared to those of an unpasteurized cider vinegar from France and a vinegar produced in Cote d'Ivoire. The ethanol content for both juices is more or less high with 9.240.04 g/L for mango and 12.680.39 g/L for papaya. The concentration of acetic acid is the highest of the organic acids for the four vinegars ranging from 37.464.6 g/L to 55.859.94 g/L. The acetic acid contents of mango and papaya vinegars are close to that of unpasteurized cider vinegar from France but higher than that of vinegar produced in Cote d'Ivoire. Thus, this study allowed the production of "Assabonou" mango and papaya vinegars from two consecutive fermentations (alcoholic then acetic). This process is fast, less expensive and easily applicable. This application case could be an alternative for the processing of seasonal fruits to reduce postharvest losses. © 2020 The Authors.

Journal of Food Quality					The long-term availability of cassava ferment and the production of attieke of healthy and consistent quality are becoming serious problems in Cote d"Ivoire. The overall objective of this work was to assess the effect of several drying techniques on the performance of the traditional cassava ferment with a view to establishing a stabilized ferment for the production of attieke in Cote d"Ivoire. To do this, three drying techniques were used, namely, oven drying, sun drying, and freeze-drying. The end of the drying process is marked by the stabilization of the humidity rate of the ferment. The results obtained during the drying process indicate that the sun-dried ferment contains more GAM (1.20.2) *108CFU/g than the other dried ferments. The freeze-dried ferment has the highest load of lactic acid bacteria (30.2) *105CFU/g, while Bacillus was observed in large numbers in the ferment dried at 45 °C (7.10.6) *105CFU/g. The 37 °C dried and freeze-dried cassava ferments recorded high yeast loads of (7.60.5) *104CFU/g and (70.4) *104CFU/g, respectively. Moulds ((50.2) 1*102CFU/g) were only detected in the 37 °C dried culture. Moreover, during the fermentation of the cassava dough with the different ferments obtained after drying, a significant acidification occurs in the dough inoculated with the freeze-dried ferment (2.90.07%). However, the attieke produced with the freeze-dried ferment and the ferment dried at 37 °C was the most appreciated by the panelists. Thus, freeze-drying and oven drying at 37 °C are simple alternatives to the use of traditional ferments that can ensure their stability and the conservation of the cassava ferment over a long period of time.

Techno-functional characterization and biological potential of Agave americana leaves: impact on yoghurt qualities.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study aims to characterize the Agave americana leaves powder (AALP) and valorize its soluble extract (soluble extract Agave americana leaves (SEAAL)) on a steamed yoghurt. During 21 days of storage, the analyses of pH, titratable acidity, syneresis, viscosity, color and texture of SEAAL at 1, 2 and 3% on refrigerated yoghurt were performed. The results revealed that AALP had a high level in mineral composition and richness in total sugars and protein with 55.68 and 34.56%, respectively. Concerning the techno-functional and biological properties, AALP had a higher (p<0.05) water holding capacity (WHC), oil holding capacity (OHC) and swelling capacity (SWC), exhibiting a good anti-food-borne bacterial activity, especially against Salmonella typhymurium. The incorporation of SEAAL extract into yoghurt was also investigated to determine the rheological properties, instrumental color (L*, a* and b*) and textural (hardness, cohesivness, adhesiveness and elasticity) parameters, as well as sensory attributes using a 5-point hedonic scale. Generally, SEAAL improved the color and texture of the product by decreasing the syneresis and increasing the viscosity compared to the control samples. Similarly, the yoghurt enriched with 2% of SEAAL was the most appreciated by the tasting panel. Given its richness in nutritious ingredients, SEAAL could be a promising constituent for improving the quality of yoghurt. Furthermore, SEAAL could be a strong candidate for future applications in a wide range of healthy dairy products. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

International Dairy Journal					The coagulation of dromedary and cows' skim milk using camel chymosin was evaluated. Milk coagulation was monitored using viscosimetric and conductometric techniques. Syneresis and cheese yield were also assessed. The proximate composition, colour, texture and sensory properties of the cheeses obtained were investigated over 7 days storage. The initial viscosity value was higher for cows' skim milk than for dromedary skim milk. Dromedary skim milk had substantially longer coagulation time (about 72.3 min) than cows' skim milk (about 27.5 min). Dromedary skim milk gel had lower syneresis percentage and moisture content with higher cheese yield. PH values of white brined cheeses decreased during storage with lower values for dromedary skim milk cheeses. Hardness of cheeses increased during storage with higher values for cows' skim milk cheeses. Regardless of storage day, dromedary skim milk cheeses were more acceptable than cows' skim milk cheeses as evaluated by sensory panellists. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of freeze-drying on the antioxidant and the cytotoxic properties of Allium roseum L. and its application in stabilizing food emulsions.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Allium roseum is a wild edible plant in North Africa. In the present study, the effect of freeze-drying on the phenolic profile, the antioxidant, and the cytotoxic properties of this plant is investigated for the first time. Furthermore, this is the first research that studies its ability to preserve the stability of emulsions. We found that water extract prepared from freeze-dried leaves (FDL) contains higher amount of phenolic compounds than the extract prepared from fresh leaves (FL) and therefore the most important antioxidant power. FDL extract is more cytotoxic on K562, MCF-7, and Caco-2 cancer cells. Chromatographic analyses identified kaempferol and luteolin-7-o-glucoside As the major phenolic compounds. Finally, water extract prepared from FDL preserved the physical stability of W/O emulsion at 4 °C and room temperature over 30 days. It also protects those emulsions from the production of free radicals at the same temperatures and during the whole storage period. Practical applications. Allium roseum is an edible and medicinal plant highly used in the North African kitchen. However, the plant is not available during all the year. The leaves of this plant could be dried for conservation. The present study shows that freeze-drying the leaves of A. roseum preserved their phenolic composition and enhanced their antioxidant power and their cytotoxicity on breast, colorectal, and leukemia cancer cells. Water extract prepared from freeze-dried leaves preserved the physical and chemical stability of emulsions. Such properties are of great interest for food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Boucher, C.; Waite-Cusic, J.; Stone, D.; Kovacevic, J.							Relative performance of commercial citric acid and quaternary ammonium sanitizers against Listeria monocytogenes under conditions relevant to food industry.		Food Microbiology					Growth of Listeria monocytogenes in cold temperatures coupled with its tolerance of antimicrobials can promote its survival and persistence in food processing environments. The food industry relies heavily on cleaning and sanitation to control L. monocytogenes; therefore, it is important to understand the environmental context (i.e., temperature) on the efficacy of antimicrobials used in food industry. The minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of an "eco-friendly" citric acid-based (CAB) sanitizer and a conventional quaternary ammonium compound (CQAC) sanitizer were determined against 14 L. monocytogenes isolates at 4-30 °C. A subset of isolates (n=3) was also exposed to sub-lethal concentrations of sanitizers to assess differences in growth behavior. CAB and CQAC were effective at manufacturer recommended concentrations in liquid assays. The MBC of CAB was significantly lower at 4 °C compared to 23 °C (p< 0.05), whereas the MBC of CQAC was unchanged between 4 °C and 23 °C. Manufacturers' recommendations for dose and duration of CAB and CQAC were unable to consistently achieve a >5-log reduction of L. monocytogenes attached to surfaces. Findings from this study demonstrate the importance of sanitizer evaluation under conditions representative of their use in the food industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Boudaoud, S.; Aouf, C.; Devillers, H.; Sicard, D.; Segond, D.							Sourdough yeast-bacteria interactions can change ferulic acid metabolism during fermentation.		Food Microbiology					The metabolism of ferulic acid (FA) was studied during fermentation with different species and strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, in synthetic sourdough medium. Yeast strains of Kazachstania humilis, Kazachstania bulderi, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as lactic acid bacteria strains of Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Lactiplantibacillus xiangfangensis, Levilactobacillus hammesii, Latilactobacillus curvatus and Latilactobacillus sakei were selected from French natural sourdoughs. Fermentation in presence or absence of FA was carried out in LAB and yeasts monocultures, as well as in LAB/yeast co-cultures. Our results indicated that FA was mainly metabolized into 4-vinylguaiacol (4-VG) by S. cerevisiae strains, and into dihydroferulic acid (DHFA) and 4-VG in the case of LAB. Interactions of LAB and yeasts led to the modification of FA metabolism, with a major formation of DHFA, even by the strains that do not produce it in monoculture. Interestingly, FA was almost completely consumed by the F. sanfranciscensis bFs17 and K. humilis yKh17 pair and converted into DHFA in 89.5 19.6% yield, while neither bFs17, nor yKh17 strains assimilated FA in monoculture.

J		Boudaoud, S.; Sicard, D.; Suc, L.; Conejero, G.; Segond, D.; Aouf, C.							Ferulic acid content variation from wheat to bread.		Food Science & Nutrition					The health-promoting effects of whole-grain consumption have been attributed in a large part to the phytochemical profile of the wheat grain, and particularly to the bioactive molecules present in bran. This study shed light on the impact of human practices, especially harvesting sites (terroirs) and wheat species and varieties, as well as bread-making conditions on the variation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial ferulic acid (FA) content. FA concentration in the bran of wheat species (durum and bread wheat) and varieties (Chevalier, Renan, Redon, Saint Priest le vernois rouge, Bladette de Provence, Pireneo, Rouge de Bordeaux, LA1823, Claudio et Bidi17) harvested in five sites in France on 2015 and 2017, has been evaluated. Statistical analysis showed significant differences in FA content for wheat varieties and terroirs. During bread making, baking and type of leaven impacted the FA content of dough and bread. The differences were not due to the type of fermentation (sourdough/commercial yeast) but rather to the diversity of fermenting microbial strains and flour used for backslopping. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Boudebouz, A.; Romero, A.; Hermoso, J. F.; Boque, R.; Mestres, M.							Processing factors that affect the balance of alcohols and alkyl esters during "Arbequina" olive oil production: separation and clarification steps.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to assess how different conditions used on the centrifugation step during olive oil extraction affect its quality by considering the balance of fatty acid alkyl esters (FAAEs) and their precursor alcohols. All the experiments were carried out under real working conditions in a two-phase decanter followed by a vertical centrifuge (VC) and different water injection doses and paste injection rates were tested. The fruits used were from "Arbequina" variety at two different maturity stages and the balances of alcohols and FAAEs were measured at the outlets of both, decanter and VC, with respect to the system inlet. Results show that the paste injection rate affects the content of alcohols and FAAEs in the final oil, which tend to increase when working closer to the maximum capacity of the decanter. Different behaviors have been detected when dealing with unripe or ripe fruits. Similarly, the water addition doses have different effects on the FAAEs and alcohols formation depending on the maturity status. Therefore, both the decanter and the step decanter to vertical centrifuge are key points that, when properly controlled, allow minimizing FAAEs formation, which is essential for obtaining quality oils.

J		Boufadi, M. Y.; Soubhye, J.; Antwerpen, P. van							Anti-inflammatory, antioxidant effects, and bioaccessibility of Tigzirt propolis.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This work aims to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of Tigzirt propolis native to Algeria. We divided 48 male Wistar rats into 8 groups. We orally administered ethyl acetate extract of propolis (EAP), pure polyphenols compounds, or diclofenac 5 days before induction of inflammation by of carrageenan (100 mug/ml, i.p.). We determined the development of paw edema, biological parameters, myeloperoxidase activity, TNF-alpha, and prostaglandin E2 and measured the oxidative status parameters, as well. Finally, we analyzed the absorption and bioaccessibility of propolis in rats' plasma using GC-MS after orally dosing rats (250 mg/kg). The pretreatment by 200 and 250 mg/kg of propolis significantly reduced the edema rates after the third hour. Propolis can restore the disruption of homeostasis as well as markers of inflammation induced by carrageenan in Wistar rats, and an increase of the enzymatic activities. Furthermore, the inflammation was better resolved in rats that received propolis than in those treated with pure polyphenols. Practical applications. Propolis is a natural mixture that bees produce by mixing gathered resin and gums to bee saliva and wax. Our research investigated the effect of Tigzirt propolis on the inhibition of biomarkers of inflammation and the development of paw edema. Propolis extract helped to reduce PGE2, TNF-alpha, myeloperoxidase, and malondialdehyde levels and increase the total antioxidant levels in plasma. Our findings emphasized the use of phenolic extract of propolis in industries such as nutraceuticals for the prevention of inflammatory diseases. It can also protect the body against damage under oxidative stress. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J.; Macias-Gonzalez, M.							25-Hydroxyvitamin D status is associated with interleukin-6 methylation in adipose tissue from patients with colorectal cancer.		Food & Function					A dysfunctional visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is characterized by increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, which may increase the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the epigenetic contribution to the inflammatory status is poorly understood. In our study, we hypothesized that a dysfunctional VAT may be a risk factor for CRC, through epigenetic modifications. Therefore, we aimed to study the transcriptional/methylation profile of proinflammatory cytokines and genes related to vitamin D metabolism in VAT from CRC patients, and evaluate their association with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D). We included 129 participants (68 healthy participants and 61 CRC patients). We found that the majority of the studied genes are upregulated and hypomethylated in CRC patients, when compared to the healthy subjects (p< 0.05). In addition, serum 25 (OH) D was associated with both mRNA gene expression and methylation of key genes, such as interleukin (IL) 6, IL10, vitamin D receptor (VDR) or cytochrome P450 subfamily 27 type B1 (CYP27B1) (p< 0.05). Interestingly, while high IL6 expression was related to poor survival in CRC (p< 0.05), IL6 methylation was associated with an increased risk of CRC, in which 25 (OH) D partially mediated this association (p< 0.05). Our study suggests a potential association between epigenetic regulation of inflammatory mediators in VAT-such as IL6-in the CRC context, in which 25 (OH) D may mediate this risk. Therefore, vitamin D could affect the epigenetic status of IL6, which can be considered for additional preventive strategies. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

An epigenetic signature is associated with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in colorectal cancer tumors.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Introduction. Vitamin D has been widely associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) through different insights. This study aims to explore the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25 (OH) D) and the global DNA methylation in tumor from CRC patients. Methods and Results. A genome-wide DNA methylation analysis is conducted in 20 CRC patients under categorical (10 patients have 25 (OH) D <30 ng mL-1; 10 patients with 25 (OH) D ≥30 ng mL-1) and continuous models of 25 (OH) D. A total of 95 differentially methylated CpGs (DMCpGs) are detected under the categorical model (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05), while 16 DMCpGs are found under the continuous model. Regional analysis showed eight vitamin D-associated differentially methylated regions (DMR). Between them, a DMR is the most significant at cAMP-Dependent Protein Kinase Inhibitor Alpha (PKIA) locus. Furthermore, seven genes, including PKIA gene, have more or equal than two significant DMCpGs. The protein networking analysis found pathways implicated in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix, as well as signaling transduction. Conclusions. This study identifies novel epigenetic loci associated with serum 25 (OH) D status. Interestingly, also, a positive association between vitamin D and DNA methylation in the CRC context is found, suggesting a role in CRC. Further studies are warranted to clarify and replicate these results. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Boughattas, F.; Karoui, R.							Mid infrared spectroscopy combined with chemometric tools for the identification of canned tuna species in brine.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Each tuna species appeared to have its unique price depending on landing, season, and nutritional value, hence, adulteration could occur by replacing tunas of high quality by those having low quality. This study was undertaken to explore the potential of mid infrared (MIR) spectroscopy for discriminating canned tunas containing different species: yellowfin, skipjack, bigeye, and albacore. A total of 218 canned tunas, produced at the pilot scale were scanned by MIR in the 4000-900 cm-1. The factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) applied to the concatenated data sets corresponding to the first 5 principal components (PCs) of the principal component analysis (PCA) applied to the 3000-2800 cm-1, 1700-1500 cm-1 and 1500-900 cm-1 spectral regions gave a model with correct classification rate amounting to 74.96%. The established model was tested on 40 commercial canned tunas; a total (100%) of correct classification was obtained for the bigeye tuna, while the presence of different species was observed for canned tunas labelled as skipjack, yellowfin and albacore.

Characterization and antibacterial activity of gelatin-based film incorporated with Arbutus unedo L. fruit extract on Sardina pilchardus.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Gelatin-based films incorporated with Arbutus unedo fruit extract (AFE) were prepared and characterized. LC-DAD analysis demonstrated that the most abundant phenolic compounds in AFE were procyanidin B2 and gallic acid. The incorporation of AFE in gelatin tested film (TF) caused a remarkable decrease in water vapor permeability (5.01*10-9 g.mm/h.cm2. Pa) compared to control films (CF). FTIR analyses presented a broadening of amide A and I bands in the spectrum corresponding to the tested film. Films were used to coat samples on fresh fillets of Sardina pilchardus intentionally inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Fish samples were stored refrigerated for 12 days; TF exhibited important antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria, especially against S. aureus. The obtained results will encourage the use of gelatin-based film containing AFE extract in active food packaging systems to control surface contamination by foodborne pathogenic microorganisms. Novelty impact statement. A. unedo extract (AFE) decreased gelatin water vapor permeability and contributed to the formation of hydrogen bonds between the phenolic compounds and the protein matrix. Active gelatin films were able to exert a remarkable antibacterial effect against S. aureus, L. monocytogenes, and P. aeruginosa, intentionally inoculated into sardine fillets. This study demonstrated that the application of gelatin-based film containing AFE on fresh sardine fillets could have the potential in controlling the growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Boukid, F.; Curti, E.; Diantom, A.; Carini, E.; Vittadini, E.							A multilevel investigation supported by multivariate analysis for tomato product formulation.		European Food Research and Technology					Industrial processing of tomato includes its cutting and mincing, thermal treatments, and the addition of ingredients, which might induce changes in physicochemical properties of the final products. In this frame, the impact of texturing/thickening [xanthan gum (X) or potato fiber (F)] on the macroscopic, mesoscopic and molecular properties of tomato double concentrate (TDC) was investigated to determine if F can efficiently substitute X, in association with small solutes (sugar and salt) and thermal treatment (cold and hot). At a macroscopic level, multivariate statistics (MANOVA) underlined that color change (DeltaE) was increased by X and F addition contrary to heating and the addition of salt and sugar. MANOVA revealed that texture was greatly enhanced through the use of F over X. 1H NMR molecular mobility changes were more controlled by texturing agents (F and X) than thermal treatment and small solutes. Particularly F increased the more rigid population indicating stronger interaction with water molecules resulting in shear-thinning flow. However, adding X contributed into the increase of the dynamic and mobile populations. Therefore, F can be a valid "clean label" substitute of X in modulating tomato products properties. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Products were initially classified into four types: i.e., veggie, red meat-, fish- and poultry-based. Gluten, wheat, and soy were the most declared allergens regardless of the burgers type. Veggie burgers showed levels of energy, fat, and saturate fatty acids (SFA) similar to fish-and poultry-based burgers, but lower than red meat burgers. Compared to conventional burgers, veggie had higher amounts of carbohydrates and sugars and a lower content of proteins, but no difference in salt. Due to the high compositional intra-variability in the veggie burgers, vegetarian and vegan burgers were further analyzed separately. Vegan burgers had higher levels of energy, fat, SFA and protein than vegetarian burgers, but lower carbohydrates and sugars. Once again large differences in the nutritional parameters were observed in both vegan and vegetarian burger categories due to the wide range of ingredients and formulations employed in these types of products. A clear and comprehensive informative labeling is especially needed for vegan and vegetarian burgers to allow the consumer to make a rational decision based on the nutritional facts of these products.

J		Boukid, F.; Castellari, M.							Food and beverages containing algae and derived ingredients launched in the market from 2015 to 2019: a front-of-pack labeling perspective with a special focus on Spain.		Foods					Algae are a source of functional ingredients, with a large spectrum of healthy and functional compounds. Therefore, this study aimed to provide an overview on commercialized food and beverages made from algae and derived ingredients, with emphasis on the Spanish market, relying on the front-of-pack labeling. For this reason, the Mintel Global New Products Database was searched for foods and beverages containing "algae" ingredients, launched during the period 2015-2019. A total of 13,090 items were found worldwide, including 5720 items in Europe, in which 436 items were in Spain. Regardless of the market (global, European, and Spanish), a similar number of products categories (n=20), dominant categories (dairy and desserts and ice cream) and dominant algal ingredient (carrageenans) were found. Nutritional information retrieved from Spanish products underlined that algae-based snacks had significantly lower energy, fat, and salt content compared to algae-free counterparts. On the contrary, spirulina-enriched ready to drink beverages had significantly higher energy and salt than algae-free. As such, reading the nutritional labeling is crucial to selecting products that suit consumer needs or/and expectations. Furthermore, only 8% of products reported the algal species and the level of inclusion, so this study emphasizes the importance of labeling legislation to provide complete product information to consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Boukid, F.; Comaposada, J.; Ribas-Agusti, A.; Castellari, M.							Development of high-protein vegetable creams by using single-cell ingredients from some microalgae species.		Foods					The aim of this paper was to develop high-protein vegetable creams through the incorporation of microalgae. Single-cell ingredients from Arthrospira platensis (spirulina), Chlorella vulgaris, Tetraselmis chui, and Nannochloropsis oceanica were incorporated at two levels of addition (1.5% and 3.0%) to a standard vegetable cream (STD). Effects of incorporation were assessed in terms of physicochemical and rheological attributes as well as nutritional labeling facts. Creams formulated with 3% A. platensis, N. oceanica, or T. chui showed strong color differences (6 < DeltaE < 12) compared to STD; creams formulated with 1.5% A. platensis, T. chui, or N. oceanica showed perceptible differences (3 < DeltaE < 6); and those made with C. vulgaris at 1.5 and 3% exhibited small differences (DeltaE < 2). Moisture content, water activity, pH, syneresis, and °Brix did not show significant changes. Adding microalgae increased Bostwick consistency and decreased the consistency coefficient (K) except in creams made with A. platensis, which showed comparable values to STD. Principal component analysis indicated that creams made with 1.5% C. vulgaris were the most similar to STD considering all evaluated parameters. Estimation of the nutritional labeling facts showed that the four formulations could be labeled as having "high protein content" following the present EU legislation. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Boukid, F.; Lamri, M.; Dar, B. N.; Garron, M.; Castellari, M.							Vegan alternatives to processed cheese and yogurt launched in the European market during 2020: a nutritional challenge?		Foods					Vegan alternatives to cheese (VAC) and yogurt (VAY) are fast-growing markets in Europe due to the increasing interest in plant-based alternatives to dairy products. This study aimed to take a closer look at the year 2020 and accordingly retrieved the nutritional information of dairy cheese and yogurt and their vegan counterparts for comparison. It was found that VAY (n = 182) provide more energy, total fats, and carbohydrates than dairy yogurt (n = 86), while saturated fatty acids (SFAs), sugars, and salt were not different between the two categories. Compared to dairy products (25.6%), 72.9% of the alternative products were declared low/no/reduced allergen, hence providing a larger spectrum of products to respond to consumers" requirements. VAC (n = 114) showed high versatility of form compared to dairy (n = 115). Nutritionally, VAC have higher total fats, SFAs, and carbohydrates, but lower protein, salt, and sugar than dairy cheese. Food developers will continue to look for clean label solutions to improve the nutritional values of vegan products through the incorporation of natural ingredients, besides enhancing their taste and texture to appeal to flexitarians. © 2021 by the authors.

Can a structured emulsion (fat in water-fibre system) substitute saturated fat in cookies without hampering their quality?		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Replacing fat and saturated fat in baked goods without affecting their quality characteristics is a challenging task. This study evaluated complete and partial substitution of saturated fats (butter and palm oil) by structured emulsions [SE, oil (sunflower)-in-water (fibre-water) emulsion] in cookies by investigating its impact on product quality. Nutritional labelling underlined a drastic reduction in saturated fatty acids [-35% (50% substitution) and -73% (100% substitution)] compared to their conventional counterparts (butter and palm oil). Partial substitution did not markedly affect physicochemical properties, while complete substitution resulted in thinner, harder and darker cookies compared to the controls. Particularly, cookies made with (50:50) structured emulsion-palm oil had the highest sensory scores, and they were perceived as soft, buttery and crunchy. Thus, the use of structured emulsion might be a valuable alternative to develop a potentially healthier product with acceptable sensory properties. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Boulemkahel, S.; Betoret, E.; Benatallah, L.; Rosell, C. M.							Effect of low pressures homogenization on the physico-chemical and functional properties of rice flour.		Food Hydrocolloids					Research was conducted to explore the use of low pressure homogenization for extending functionality of rice flours. The impact of low pressure homogenization (0, 30, 50 MPa and 0, 1, 2, 3 passes) on the particle size distribution of long (LRF) and medium (MRF) rice grain flour was evaluated. The pressure level and the number of passes resulted in a lower particle size in both rice flours. Higher pressures and 3 passes led to an increase in the particle size due to aggregation of smaller particles. The effect of low pressure homogenization (0, 30 or 50 MPa - 3 passes) on the physicochemical (composition, bulk density, thiol groups, hydration, emulsifying properties, hydrophobicity, crystallinity) thermal and pasting properties was analyzed. Homogenization increased swelling, oil absorption capacity and surface hydrophobicity of LRF and MRF samples even at 30 MPa. The bulk density and the emulsion stability of samples decreased by pressure. However, the emulsifying activity and thiol groups did not change in LRF, while increased in MRF particularly at 30 MPa. SEM micrographs revealed the microstructure changes, but no significant differences were observed in starch crystallinity. FTIR spectra suggested the modification of the flour constituents, particularly in MRF, reaching higher intensities. The disintegration and modification of the large molecules, increasing availability of binding sites, and partial gelatinization of starch granules, led to flours with different pasting performances. Correlation analysis confirmed that the particle size reduction played a determinant role in the structural and physicochemical changes of both rice flour varieties used.

Rheological and textural properties of lafun, a stiff dough, from improved cassava varieties.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Summay: We studied the textural and rheological (viscoelastic) properties of fresh lafun dough, a fermented cassava product, and their changes during storage at 45 °C for 5 and 24 h, in order to determine after-cooking storability. Lafun flours were produced from three types of cassava varieties: seven improved white-fleshed varieties, seven improved provitamin A carotenoids (pVAC) varieties and two local white-fleshed varieties; and processed into lafun doughs. Pasting properties of the flours were assessed. Flours from local varieties had pasting profiles with highest viscosities, while pVAC flours had the lowest. The three types of cassava varieties varied significantly in most of their pasting properties. Four promising improved varieties were identified, based on high peak viscosity (55.8-61.5 P) and stiffer texture than local varieties during storage. Undesirable varieties were also found, which softened during storage instead of hardening. Optimum texture of lafun dough was obtained after 5 h of storage. © 2020 The Authors.

Active carboxymethylcellulose-based edible films: influence of free and encapsulated curcumin on films' properties.		Foods					Carboxymethylcellulose (CMC)-based films can act as a protective barrier in food surfaces and a carrier of bioactive compounds, such as curcumin. However, incorporating curcumin in hydrophilic matrixes can be a challenge, and new strategies need to be explored. In this work, CMC-based films containing free curcumin and curcumin-loaded nanohydrogels (composed of lactoferrin and glycomacropeptide) were produced and characterized. The incorporation of curcumin-loaded nanohydrogels showed a significant decrease in films' thickness (from 0.0791 to 0.029 mm). Furthermore, the water vapor permeability of CMC-based films was significantly decreased (62%) by incorporating curcumin-loaded nanohydrogels in the films. The water affinity's properties (moisture, solubility, and contact angle) of films were also affected by incorporating encapsulated curcumin. The addition of nanohydrogels to CMC-based films reduced the tensile strength values from 16.46 to 9.87 MPa. Chemical interactions were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The release profile of curcumin from CMC-based films was evaluated at 25 °C using a hydrophilic food simulant and suggests that the release mechanism of the curcumin happens by Fick's diffusion and Case II transport. Results. Showed that protein-based nanohydrogels can be a good strategy for incorporating curcumin in edible films, highlighting their potential for use in food applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Use of Hanseniaspora guilliermondii and Hanseniaspora opuntiae to enhance the aromatic profile of beer in mixed-culture fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae.		Food Microbiology					Beer production is predominantly carried out by Saccharomyces species, such as S. cerevisiae and S. pastorianus. However, the introduction of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in the brewing process is now seen as a promising strategy to improve and differentiate the organoleptic profile of beer. In this study, 17 non-Saccharomyces strains of 12 distinct species were isolated and submitted to a preliminary sensory evaluation to determine their potential for beer bioflavouring. Hanseniaspora guilliermondii IST315 and H. opuntiae IST408 aroma profiles presented the highest acceptability and were described as having "fruity" and "toffee" notes, respectively. Their presence in mixed-culture fermentations with S. cerevisiae US-05 did not influence attenuation and ethanol concentration of beer but had a significant impact in its volatile composition. Notably, while both strains reduced the total amount of ethyl esters, H. guilliermondii IST315 greatly increased the concentration of acetate esters, especially when sequentially inoculated, leading to an 8.2-fold increase in phenylethyl acetate ("rose", "honey" aroma) in the final beverage. These findings highlight the importance of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in shaping the aroma profile of beer and suggest a role for Hanseniaspora spp. In improving it. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bourdichon, F.; Patrone, V.; Fontana, A.; Milani, G.; Morelli, L.							Safety demonstration of a microbial species for use in the food chain: Weissella confusa.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Due to their traditional use in food fermentation process for centuries, microbial food cultures are considered to have a safe history of use. A specific microbial risk assessment is therefore rarely conducted for fermented foods and their food cultures, inoculated or naturally present. Some of those food cultures have been also considered for their potential health effect as probiotic strain candidates, for which a specific safety demonstration process has been proposed by a joint expert report of FAO and WHO. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) Biohazard panel also provides an approach for evaluating the safety of a strain to be added in the food chain, the Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS). Weissella confusa, former taxon Lactobacillus confusus, is a food culture characterized in the fermentation process of sourdough. Some strains have been recently proposed for their probiotic potential. The species is also documented in recent infection case reports. It is considered nevertheless to be opportunistic as underlying factors have been suggested to explain the infection. We report here the microbial risk assessment of the species, by studying a collection of 26 food and 17 clinical isolates of Weissella confusa. The phenotypic study, genomic characterization and bibliographical survey will allow us to conclude about the safety of the species and confirm its use for food fermentation and consider specific strains for demonstration of their respective health effects as probiotic candidates.

Green solvent to substitute hexane for bioactive lipids extraction from black cumin and basil seeds.		Foods					A comparative study of bioactive lipids extraction from black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) and basil (Ocimum basilicum L.) seeds using conventional petroleum-based solvent and green solvent 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) was performed. MeTHF extraction allowed obtaining the highest oil yield in black cumin (34%). Regarding fatty acids composition, linoleic acid (61%) and alpha-linolenic (78%) were relevant in black cumin and basil green and conventionally extracted oils, respectively. Besides, MeTHF allowed obtaining higher tocopherols and total phenolics contents in black cumin (400 mg/kg of oil and 12 mg EGA/g oil) and basil (317 mg/kg oil and 5 mg EGA/g oil) compared to hexane-extracted ones. The content of major phenolic compounds in the two seed oils, trans-hydroxycinnamic acid, rosmarinic acid, and thymol was enhanced by MeTHF extraction. Furthermore, MeTHF-extracted oils possess stronger antioxidant activities (radical scavenging, total antioxidant, and beta-carotene bleaching activities) and high and similar anti-inflammatory capacity to hexane-extracted oils. In conclusion, the results revealed that MeTHF is efficient to replace hazardous solvents to extract oil from black cumin and basil seeds rich in compounds relevant to the human diet, including essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-6 and n-3), tocopherols, and phenolic compounds with improved biological activities. © 2021 by the authors.

Comparative study of the antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities of two types of moroccan Euphorbia entire honey and their phenolic extracts.		Foods					Honey is a natural food product very famous for its health benefits for being an important source of antioxidant and phenolic compounds. Euphorbia honeys obtained from different regions of Morocco were evaluated for their ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase, lipoxygenase, tyrosinase and xanthine oxidase activities. Their antioxidant properties were evaluated using the: 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging capacity, nitric oxide scavenging activity (NO) and scavenging ability of superoxide anion radical. Then, the phenolic extracts of the same entire honey samples were evaluated by liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and mass spectrometry (LC-DAD-MS) and tested for the biological activities previously evaluated on the entire honeys, in order to conduct a comparative study between both (honey and phenolic extracts). The chromatographic profiles for the studied Euphorbia honey extracts were different. Phenolic compounds gallic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and p-coumaric acid were detected in all samples, whereas kampferol was only present in two samples. Physicochemical parameters and total phenolic content were also determined. Entire honey that recorded the highest rate of phenols was sample M6 (E. resinifera) = 69.25 mg GAE/100 g. On the other hand, the phenolic extracts had better antioxidant and enzyme inhibitory activities than the entire honeys, regardless the monofloral honey type. In conclusion, the studied Euphorbia honeys may have a great potential as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-tyrosinase sources for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Zeaxanthin is a carotenoid pigment found in several fruits and vegetables. Belonging to the xanthophyll family, it is widely present in human and some animals skin and eyes, performing important physiological functions due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Several studies have explored its health benefits against important disorders such as neurological diseases, allergies, and cancer. Scope and approach. The aim of this study we to explore the sources, health benefits, and biological properties of zeaxanthin and analyzes its drug interaction with beta-carotene. Key findings and conclusion. Severela vegetable sources in particularly fruits parts contains zeaxanthin. Biological investigations showed that zeaxanthin has been found to exhibit a protective effect against excessive light and oxidative stress side effects, preventing the development of several neurological, skin, and eye disorders. It exhibits also antioxidant, antiparasitic, anthelmintic activity, and antiosteoporosis effects. Zeaxanthin can also play a role in the inflammatory response, contributing to the treatment or prevention of diseases like allergies and AIDS. Additionally, zeaxanthin can exhibit anticancer, anti-osteoporotic, and ophthalmologic effects. These different properties are mediated by diffetent cellular and molecular mechanisms exhibited by zeaxanthin such as its activation and/or blocker of cell receptors, its actions on signaling pathways, and also its effects on gene expression. Moreover, the safety as a dietary supplement has also been confirmed and its interaction with other carotenoids, such as beta-carotene, has been studied and validated in pharmacokinetic investigations. However, further investigations are needed to explore the full potential of zeaxanthin and to elucidate more its molecular pharmacodynamic actions behind its effects on human health, and to investigate also its clinical applications.

J		Bowei Zhang; Yingchuan Xu; Huan Lv; Wenwen Pang; Jin Wang; Hui Ma; Shuo Wang							Intestinal pharmacokinetics of resveratrol and regulatory effects of resveratrol metabolites on gut barrier and gut microbiota.		Food Chemistry					Resveratrol, a dietary polyphenol, has a variety of intestinal bioactivities. However, its material basis remains unknown. This study examined the intestinal pharmacokinetics of resveratrol using HPLC-MS/MS. After oral ingestion in mice, resveratrol and its sulfation metabolites were identified in copious amount in the entire intestinal tract and feces. The glucuronidation metabolites were found in major quantity only in the small intestine. The amount of resveratrol and its metabolites in the total intestine peaked at 4 h, with a concentration of 20074.8 muM, which corresponded to 14.0% of the administrated dose. During in vitro fermentation , resveratrol-3-O-sulfate, but not resveratrol, significantly promoted the growth of Lactobacillus reuteri (10-fold higher). During the incubation with Caco-2 cells, resveratrol-3-O-sulfate significantly up-regulated the mRNA expressions of tight junction and mucin-related proteins. In conclusion, the intestinal concentration of resveratrol could partially support its intestinal bioactivities, which may be mediated through the actions of its metabolites.

J		Bowen Chen; Jiaming Huang; Yang Liu; Haiquan Liu; Yong Zhao; Jing Jing Wang							Effects of the curcumin-mediated photodynamic inactivation on the quality of cooked oysters with Vibrio parahaemolyticus during storage at different temperature.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Photodynamic inactivation (PDI) is a promising method with multiple targets to inactivate bacteria on food using visible light. Inactivation potency of the curcumin-mediated blue light-emitting diode (LED) PDI against the pathogen Vibrio parahaemolyticus on cooked oysters and its effects on the storage quality were investigated by the microbiological, physical, chemical and histological methods during storage at 4 °C, 10 °C and 25 °C. Results showed that the PDI treatment obviously inhibited the recovery of V. parahaemolyticus on oysters during storage, and the maximal difference attained >1.0 Log10 CFU/g (> 90%) compared to control stored at 10 °C and 25 °C. Meanwhile, it displayed a potent ability (p< 0.05) to restrain the decrease of pH values, reduce the production of total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), suppress the lipids oxidation, as well as retard the changes of color difference of the oysters. In addition, the PDI effectively maintained the integrity and initial attachments of muscle fibers, and hence decreased the loss of water in myofibrillar space and the texture softening of oysters during storage. On this basis, this study facilitates the understanding of the potency of bacterial inactivation and food preservation of PDI, and hence pave the way for its application in food industry.

J		Bowen Pang; Li Huang; Jianwen Teng; Junwei Zhang; Ning Xia; Baoyao Wei							Effect of pile fermentation on the cells of Chinese Liupao tea: the first record of cell wall of Liupao tea on transmission electron microscope.		Food Chemistry					Fermentation often degrades the cell wall of dark tea, changes the carbohydrate components in the cell wall of tea, and thus affects the quality of tea. However, the lack of ultrastructural details limits our knowledge on the effect of fermentation on tea cell walls. Morphological studies of cell structures are important; thus, the cell wall of Liupao tea was analyzed under transmission electron microscopy for the first time, and the effects of different raw materials and fermentation methods on the cell wall and main carbohydrates of tea were compared. Overall, fermentation degrades the cell wall of Liupao tea under the action of microorganisms. Interestingly, the middle lamella degrades obviously, whereas the primary wall is complete. The decrease in hemicellulose and increase in water-soluble pectin (WSP) were remarkable, whereas the changes in cellulose and WSP were considerably correlated with the increase in tea polysaccharide (TPS). The results suggest that cell wall degradation might be related to the increase in TPS.

J		Bowen Wang; Qun Wu; Yan Xu; Baoguo Sun							Multiple sugars promote microbial interactions in Chinese baijiu fermentation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The utilization of fermentable sugars determines the succession and metabolism of microbial communities in traditional food fermentations. However, the profile of fermentable sugars and their effects on the microbial interactions and metabolism remains poorly understood. In this study, we revealed the compositions of fermentable sugars in the baijiu fermentation, including maltose, cellobiose, glucose, D-galactose and arabinose. Furthermore, we found the specific sugars (glucose and maltose) were positively correlated with the growth of the abundant genera Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces in the baijiu fermentation. Moreover, a proper combination of sugars mixture (glucose and maltose in a ratio of 9:1, wt/wt) enhanced the symplastic growth and interactions of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces strains in a simulative baijiu fermentation under the laboratory. Meanwhile, the biomass of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces strains in the cultivation by the optimized sugars combination were 1.21-and 1.19-fold higher than that of cultivation by the single substrate-sugar. In addition, the formation of these sugars were associated with the saccharifying enzymes from Jiuqu, like GH13 (alpha-amylase, EC 3.2.1.1), GH15 (glucoamylase, EC 3.2.1.3) and so on. This study indicated that specific sugars in substrate-sugars promoted the microbial interactions in baijiu fermentation.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Dried minced pork slices (DMPS) have been widely accepted owing to their unique flavor and taste, but traditional roasting (TR) process for making DMPS are time-consuming and complicated. This study presents a microwave heating (MH) method for rapid preparation of DMPS with different fat pork levels. The results indicated that DMPS size significantly affected the MH patterns. As the fat pork content increased, the complex permittivity showed a downward tendency, and the 30% fat pork content improved both the heating rate and uniformity. Fat components significantly altered the texture and color characteristics, but DMPS made by MH possessed a higher hardness and toughness values than TR. Low-field nuclear magnetic resonance analysis demonstrated that the proportion of T21 gradually decreased in MH group, while no distinct changes were observed in the TR group with the increase of fat pork content. In addition, the results of comprehensive sensory evaluation in the MH and TR groups revealed that such a convenient MH technology is alternative for the fabrication of DMPS with acceptable product quality.

J		Boyd, A. P.; Talbert, J. N.; Acevedo, N. C.							Effect of agitation and added cholesterol esterase on bioaccessibility of phytosterols in a standardized in vitro digestion model.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					There is great interest in reaching a consensus method for in vitro digestion of foods. The COST INFOGEST network of researchers has developed a standardized protocol, which is appropriate for basic digestibility studies, but may be insufficient for more complex studies, such as micronutrient bioaccessibility. In the present study, the bioaccessibility of phytosterols (PS) was evaluated using the standardized and modified versions of the in vitro digestion protocol. The INFOGEST protocol was used without modification for 2% solutions of either free phytosterols (FPS) or esterified phytosterols (EPS) in soybean oil. The effect of two variables which have yet to be explored using the INFOGEST protocol was subsequently evaluated. Those variables are: (1) changing the mode of agitation from orbital shaking to head over heels (HOH) rotation and (2) adding pancreatic cholesterol esterase (CE) during the intestinal phase. Bioaccessibility of FPS was greater than that of EPS, and HOH rotation caused a further increase in bioaccessibility of FPS but not EPS. Addition of CE caused a slight, but significant improvement in bioaccessibility of EPS, though hydrolysis was incomplete. Our findings highlight a need for further evaluation of the standardized in vitro digestion protocol, especially for complex studies such as lipid bioaccessibility. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Boyu Jia; Xiaofang Liao; Chaonan Sun; Ling Fang; Lidong Zhou; Weijun Kong							Development of a quantum dot nanobead-based fluorescent strip immunosensor for on-site detection of aflatoxin B1 in lotus seeds.		Food Chemistry					Owing to the serious threat of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) to public health, development of a reliable method for accurate determination of it is extremely necessary and urgent. In this study, a simple, rapid and highly-sensitive quantum dot nanobeads (QBs) based lateral flow fluorescent strip immunosensor was developed for on-site detection of AFB1 in edible and medicinal lotus seeds. Carboxylated QBs were used as the fluorescent markers to prepare the fluorescent probe through coupling QBs with anti-AFB1 antibodies. Bovine serum albumin (BSA)-AFB1 antigens and goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies were coated on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane to prepare the test (T) and control (C) lines, respectively. Qualitative analysis of AFB1 was realized by naked eye, and the quantitative determination was achieved with a portable strip reader. Results showed that the newly-developed test strip sensor could achieve rapid detection of AFB1 within 15 min, allowing a limit of detection (LOD) of 1 ng/mL (2 mug/kg) and a linear range of 1-19 ng/mL (2-38 mug/kg). Recovery rates from the fortified lotus seeds with low, medium and high spiking concentrations (2.5,5 and 10 mug/kg) ranged from 94.0% to 116.0% with relative standard deviations less than 10%. All the results were confirmed by a standard LC-MS/MS method. The QBs-based fluorescent strip immunosensor with high sensitivity, easy operation, and low cost provided a preferred solution for rapid, on-site screening and highly-sensitive quantitation of AFB1 in a large number of lotus seed samples.

J		Boyu Tian; Chenxia Zhou; Dongxiao Li; Jiawei Pei; Ailiang Guo; Shuang Liu; Huijing Li							Monitoring the effects of hemicellulase on the different proofing stages of wheat aleurone-rich bread dough and bread quality.		Foods					This study investigated the effects of a hemicellulase dosage (20, 40, and 60 mg kg-1 of flour) on the bread quality and rheological properties of wheat aleurone-rich flour. The results showed that hemicellulase could soften dough and improve extensibility. At the optimum hemicellulase dosage (40 mg kg-1 of flour), the bread specific volume increased by 40.91% and firmness of breadcrumb decreased by 104.57% compared to those of the control. Intermolecular forces indicated that the gluten network during the proofing was mainly strengthened via disulfide bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds but not through ionic bonds after hemicellulase addition. Fourier infrared spectroscopy indicated that the hydrolytic activity of hemicellulase catalyzed the transition from alpha-helix to beta-sheet, which verified that viscoelasticity of gluten was enhanced at a dosage of 40 mg kg-1 of flour. These results suggested that hydrolyzation of hemicellulase contributed to the structural of gluten changes, thereby improving the quality of wheat aleurone-rich bread. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Boz, H.							Effect of processing on cereal folates.		Journal of Cereal Science					Whole grain cereals and cereal products containing whole grain are good sources of folate. Folates are among the most unstable vitamins and are essential for the normal functions of the human body. Storage and processing can greatly affect the folate content in the final product. On the contrary, folate content of bakery products can be increased significantly during dough fermentation. Germination can also be used to increase the folate content of bakery products. The outer layers of the grain are richer in terms of folate as in many other nutritional components. Considering the folate content, it can be said that foods containing whole grains are more suitable for nutrition. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Boziaris, I. S.; Parlapani, F. F.; DeWitt, C. A. M.							High pressure processing at ultra-low temperatures: Inactivation of foodborne bacterial pathogens and quality changes in frozen fish fillets.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					High pressure processing (HPP) at ultra-low temperatures was conducted against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica in frozen pink salmon fillets. Quality changes, such as drip loss, color and odor attributes were recorded in non-inoculated pollock, pink salmon and tuna fillets. Pressures at 250 and 400 MPa were applied from 0.5 to 10 min. Reductions up to 3.5 log cfu/g were recorded for the treatments performed at -32 °C, in contrast to-50 °C where the reductions were only up to 1.5 log cfu/g. Higher pressure did not cause higher reduction. It was apparent that the main factor contributing to the bacterial inactivation is the phase transition of ice structure from I to III, in contrast to transition from I to II. Drip loss was not higher than the expected with HPP at temperatures above 0 °C, while color changes were negligible. Finally, the odor evaluation did not exhibit considerable differences between untreated and treated samples. Industrial relevance High pressure processing at ultra-low temperatures is a promising treatment for bacterial inactivation and retention of quality attributes of frozen fish. Treatment at 250 MPa for only 3 min at temperatures just below -22 °C, which is feasible and affordable, caused a more than 3-log reduction against Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, without affecting considerably the quality properties. Thus, the application of low pressure and shorter processing times gives a great potential for industrial application for frozen fish or fish that wouldn't be undesirable to freeze before pressurization.

J		Bozinou, E.; Lakka, A.; Poulianiti, K.; Lalas, S.; Makris, D. P.							Cyclodextrins as high-performance green co-solvents in the aqueous extraction of polyphenols and anthocyanin pigments from solid onion waste.		European Food Research and Technology					This investigation was carried out with the scope to examine three commonly used cyclodextrins (CDs), beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD), methyl beta-cyclodextrin (m-beta-CD) and 2-hydroxypropyl beta-cyclodextrin (HP-beta-CD) as green co-solvents for the effective extraction of polyphenols and pigment from onion solid wastes (OSW). Efficiency appraisal was based on the "extraction efficiency index" (Iee), a parameter established to readily assess the ability of a CD to boost aqueous polyphenol extraction. M-beta-CD was found to be the most efficient, giving Iee of 3.39 and 0.073 mg mumolCD-1 for total polyphenols and total pigments, respectively. Response surface optimization revealed that both m-beta-CD and HP-beta-CD required almost identical time and temperature conditions for maximized polyphenol recovery, but major differences were found for pigment extraction. beta-CD was the least efficient in extracting total polyphenols, but it displayed a satisfactory effectiveness in pigment extraction. The antiradical activity and ferric-reducing power of the extracts generated with m-beta-CD and HP-beta-CD were comparable to those of hydroethanolic and hydroglycerolic extracts. Both these CDs were also more efficient than beta-CD in extracting spiraeoside and quercetin, but beta-CD exhibited higher efficiency for anthocyanin extraction. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	11	2831	2845	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03839-2					FSTA:2022-01-Jq0603
J		Bozkir, H.; Tekgul, Y.; Erten, E. S.							Effects of tray drying, vacuum infrared drying, and vacuum microwave drying techniques on quality characteristics and aroma profile of orange peels.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This study aimed to dry orange peels using tray drying (TD), vacuum infrared drying (VID), and vacuum microwave drying (VMD) techniques and to investigate the effects of different drying techniques on the drying kinetics, physical, chemical characteristics, and volatile compounds. The VMD raised the drying rate and the effective water diffusivity compared to the TD and the VID. It was detected that the TD, VID, and VMD at 50 °C required 300, 106, and 20.67min, respectively. The VMD showed the highest vitamin C, total phenolic substance, total carotenoid content, whereas the TD indicated the lowest color values. A total of 63 volatile compounds which consist of 16 aldehydes and ketones, 4 esters, 34 terpenes, and 9 other types of compounds were determined in dried orange peels. It was determined that the VID technique caused the least destructing in volatile compounds, whereas the TD technique was the most destructive. Practical Applications. Drying is a common preservation method used for the long-term durability of foods. Drying of orange peel conduces not only to decrease environmental problems but also to provide economic benefits. Dried orange peel is used in herbal teas and food products because it is rich in aromatic flavor and odor components. Orange peel was dried using tray drying, vacuum infrared drying, and vacuum microwave drying. The vacuum microwave drying increased the drying rate and effective water diffusivity to others. The vacuum microwave drying and vacuum infrared drying protected quality characteristics, and volatile compounds of orange peels. This study demonstrated that the waste orange peels could be dried with different drying methods and converted into products with high nutritional components. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		bozkir, hamza/ABI-3796-2020; Erten, Edibe/H-6349-2017	bozkir, hamza/0000-0002-8868-697X; Erten, Edibe/0000-0002-6287-1958; TEKGUL BARUT, Yeliz/0000-0001-8173-023X							2021	44	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13611					FSTA:2021-04-Jc5841
J		Bozkurt, F.; Bekiroglu, H.; Dogan, K.; Karasu, S.; Sagdic, O.							Technological and bioactive properties of wheat glutenin hydrolysates prepared with various commercial proteases.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to investigate the effect of different types of proteolytic enzymes (flavourenzyme, savinase, subsitilin, and savinase) on the technological and bioactive properties of glutenin hydrolysate. The degree of hydrolysis (DH) of the glutenin proteins significantly differed according to the enzyme types (p < 0.05). SDS patterns showed that the number and density of the bands decreased as the DH increased and the lowest molecular weight peptide fractions was observed in savinase and subsitilin hydrolysates. In general, hydrolysates with low DH had superior technological properties (oil absorption capacity, hydrophobicity, emulsifying activity, and stability index) compared to the higher ones. After enzymatic hydrolysis, the beta sheet (%) of the hydrolysates increased, and the beta turn (%) decreased compared to the control sample. The antioxidant capacity of the glutenin significantly increased by enzymatic hydrolysis (p < 0.05). The highest ABTS radical scavenging activity and FRAP activity was found in savinase and subsitilin hydrolysates with relatively higher DH. All hydrolysates exhibited an anti-diabetic effect depending on the DH. The anti-diabetic activity of the hydrolysate increased with increasing DH value. Hydrolysate samples showed no cytotoxic effect on the HEK293 healthy cell line, whereas hydrolysates exhibited cytotoxic effects on MIA PaCa2 and CaCo2 cancer cell lines.

Assessment of microbial risk during Australian industrial practices for Escherichia coli O157:H7 in fresh cut-cos lettuce: a stochastic quantitative approach.		Food Microbiology					Escherichia coli O157:H7 risk associated with the consumption of fresh cut-cos lettuce during Australian industrial practices was assessed. A probabilistic risk assessment model was developed and implemented in the @Risk software by using the Monte Carlo simulation technique with 1,000, 000 iterations. Australian preharvest practices yielded predicted annual mean E. coli O157:H7 levels from 0.2 to-3.4 log CFU/g and prevalence values ranged from 2 to 6.4%. While exclusion of solar radiation from the baseline model yielded a significant increase in concentration of E. coli O157:H7 (-5.2-log fold), drip irrigation usage, exclusion of manure amended soil and rainfall reduced E. coli O157:H7 levels by 7.4,6.5, and 4.3-log fold, respectively. The microbial quality of irrigation water and irrigation type both had a significant effect on E. coli O157:H7 concentrations at harvest (p < 0.05). The probability of illness due to consumption of E. coli O157:H7 contaminated fresh cut-cos lettuce when water washing interventions were introduced into the processing module, was reduced by 1.4-2.7-log fold (p < 0.05). This study provides a robust basis for assessment of risk associated with E. coli O157:H7 contamination on fresh cut-cos lettuce for industrial practices and will assist the leafy green industry and food safety authorities in Australia to identify potential risk management strategies.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Air impingement (AI) thawing was studied as alternative to time-consuming thawing, conventionally performed in refrigerators for food service. Chicken fingers' bags (200 g), surrounded by Tylose to simulate a food service grid load, were thawed in an AI prototype. Nine combinations of process parameters (distance food to nozzles, air speed, air temperature, number of stages, and stage durations) identified by genetic algorithm optimization were applied. The optimization aimed at minimizing thawing time, food overheating (above 0 °C), and food temperature unevenness. Samples were assessed for thawing time (to 0 °C), thawing loss, water-holding capacity, firmness, microstructure, and FTIR spectra. AI allowed up to 85% thawing time reduction compared to refrigerator (41 °C), while thawing loss, water-holding capacity, and firmness were not significantly different (p>.05). Histological analysis and FTIR spectra indicated AI as an interesting technology to preserve tissue structure. Novelty impact statement. In this paper, air impingement (AI) is applied for the first time to quickly thaw chicken fingers while avoiding overheating (above 0 °C) and structural modification of meat. These results support air impingement as a valid alternative to refrigeration thawing, commonly applied for food preparation in food service. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Br Sembiring, H. S.; Koo Bok Chin							Physicochemical properties and microbial counts of low-fat model sausage affected by eggplant (Solanum melongena) powder in different drying method and level during storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study was to conducted the effect of eggplant (EP) powder on product quality of low-fat model sausages (LFS) stored for 35 days. The treatments included were as follows: control, reference (0.01% ascorbic acid, AA), 0.25% oven-dried EP powder (ODEP) (O1), 0.5% ODEP (O2), 0.25% freeze-dried EP powder (FDEP) (F1), and 0.5% FDEP (F2). The addition of EP powder reduced the redness values (a*) but increased the yellowness values (b*) of sausages (p<.05). Control sausages had higher purge loss (PL, %) and hardness values than those with EP powder (p<.05). The addition of EP powder to sausages reduced thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) values, with O2 having the lowest TBARS values (p<.05). EP powder inhibited the microbial growth in the sausages, with the F2 having the lowest levels (p<.05). Thus, adding 0.5% ODEP and FDEP extended the shelf-life of low-fat sausage during refrigerated storage. Newly impact statement. Low-fat sausage is demanded by consumers due to health concerns. Meat products can be easily oxidized through processing procedures such as heating, packaging, and storing. Eggplant (EP) is known to contain high levels of antioxidants and other bioactive compounds such as anthocyanin and delphinidin antioxidants, which can retard the oxidation process. This study was useful information to increase the quality and shelf-life of meat products using EP powder as an antioxidant and antimicrobial agent. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16001					FSTA:2022-04-Sr1911

Antifungal whey protein films activated with low quantities of water soluble chitosan.		Food Hydrocolloids					The aim of this work was to develop antifungal films from whey protein isolate (WPI) added with low quantities of a water soluble derivative of chitosan (WSCh), which was obtained through a Maillard reaction with glucosamine hydrochloride. Glycerol was used as plasticizer and sodium tripolyphosphate was added to neutralize WSCh charges, at a working pH of 6.4, to avoid coacervation due to the opposite charges interaction of both biopolymers. Nevertheless, this WSCh derivative also acted as a crosslinking agent mainly through hydrogen bonding with whey proteins, which generated a decrease in the films' solubility and elongation. Possibly a conformational change of the WPI proteins increased the films' surface hydrophobicity (with contact angles greater than 90°), but there were no increases in their mechanical resistance or in barrier to water vapor. WPI/WSCh films showed excellent fungistatic and barrier effects against the growth of fungus strains associated with food spoilage. Aspergillus niger was 100% inhibited when a suspension containing 1*103 spores/mL was inoculated on the films' surface (barrier effect), while Penicillium roqueforti was the strain more resistant to WSCh activity. The obtained results suggest interesting properties of these materials to use them as active edible coatings.

The effect of nutritional management in early lactation and dairy cow genotype on milk production, metabolic status, and uterine recovery in a pasture-based system.		Journal of Dairy Science					High levels of milk production coupled with low feed intake cause negative energy balance in early lactation, especially in the first month postpartum (PP). Therefore, specific nutritional management at this time may improve nutritional and metabolic status with the possibility of contrasting genotypes responding differently. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare the effects of nutritional management strategies and dairy cow genotype on milk production, metabolic status, and some fertility parameters during early lactation in a pasture-based system. Sixty Holstein Friesian cows were blocked on parity and genotype [low-fertility high-milk (LFHM) and high-fertility low-milk (HFLM)] and were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments in a 2*2 factorial arrangement, in a randomized complete block design based on calving date, previous 305-d milk yield, and precalving body condition score (BCS). The nutritional management treatments were: (1) ad libitum access to fresh pasture plus an allowance of 3 kg of concentrates per day (CTR, n=30); and (2) ab libitum access to a tailored total mixed ration (TMR, n=30). These diets were offered for the first 30 d PP. Following the first 30 d PP, cows fed TMR joined the CTR treatment and were managed similarly until 100 d PP. Blood samples were taken at d 7, 14, 21, and 28 PP to determine metabolic status. Milk samples for composition analysis were collected weekly and BCS assessed every 2 wk. Genotype had a significant effect on milk output, whereas LFHM had increased fat (+0.28 kg/d) and fat-plus-protein (+0.17 kg/d) yield in the first 30 d PP compared with HFLM cows. The LFHM group also exhibited higher protein and lactose yields over the first 100 d PP. Nutritional management did create significant differences in milk composition in the first 30 d: TMR cows had lower protein, milk urea nitrogen, and casein concentration and higher lactose concentration than CTR cows. Over the first 100 d PP, TMR cows had higher fat-plus-protein and lactose yields. Feeding TMR reduced concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (-0.12 mmol/L) and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (-0.10 mmol/L) compared with the CTR group. Cows fed TMR had smaller BCS losses from calving to 60 d PP. There was no effect of any treatment on uterine recovery. Cows in the LFHM group demonstrated greater milk production in the first 30 and 100 d in milk. These results demonstrate that feeding cows a TMR for the first month of lactation has positive effects on milk output, metabolic status, and BCS profile. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Multivariate correlation of the astringency sensory perception with the phenolic profiling of cashew apple genotypes.		Food Bioscience					Astringency has limited the acceptability of cashew apples and its products, despite their high nutritive value and antioxidant activity. The identification of phenolic compounds that correlate with astringency was measured directly using a sensory panel and multivariate correlation analysis of sensory descriptors for astringency and its sub-qualities with the phenolic profiling from 9 different clones of cashew apple. A trained sensory panel rated sweet taste, acid taste, astringency, harshness in mouth and throat irritation, and the phenolic compounds were identified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry system. The exploratory and regression multivariate analyses highlighted a positive correlation of anacardic acids, mainly 15:1, with the sensation of astringency and its sub-qualities (harshness in mouth and irritation in the throat), which associate them as probable chemical markers of astringency in cashew apples. The results may be useful for breeders to concomitantly obtain cashew apples with high concentrations of bioactive compounds and pleasant taste. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Spouted bed drying of milk-blackberry mixture: material thermal properties and process energy aspects.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This work presents the determination of the thermal properties of a milk-blackberry pulp mixture (25-75%, vol/vol), and of the powder obtained by spouted bed drying. Based on the experimental data, polynomial and artificial neural networks (ANNs) correlations were proposed to predict the specific heat as a function of temperature. The effects of operating variables (air temperature, atomization pressure, and feed flow rate), on the energy efficiency (EE) and on the specific consumption of energy (epsilon) were evaluated using a 23-factorial design. Afterward, the effects of feeding mode (atomization or dripping), on energy aspects were analyzed. The fusion of powder fat crystals occurred at 1 °C and at 16 °C, glass transition between 27 °C and 34 °C, and proteins denaturation starting at 87 °C. The ANNs presented higher accuracy in the specific heat prediction, with mean deviation as low as 0.5%. The inlet air temperature and the feed flow rate have affected the energy parameters, but the atomization pressure and the interaction among these variables did not. The EE ranged from 7.3 to 23.2% and the epsilon from 10.6 to 33.8 MJ/kg. Besides the reuse of the outlet air, the drip-feeding mode could be an alternative to decrease the net energy consumption of the drying process. Practical Applications. This work presents the determination of melting and glass transition temperatures, melting enthalpy, and specific heat of the paste milk-blackberry pulp (25%:75%, vol/vol) and/or powder, which are important characteristics for equipment dimensioning, process control, product quality, and to determine storage conditions. We also proposed ANN-based correlations to relate the specific heat of the paste and powder as a function of temperature. The ANNs equations showed high accuracy and were used in the analysis of the energy aspects of the spouted bed drying process. Statistical analysis of energy aspects as a function of operating variables was performed and two linear response models were obtained, allowing to predict the specific consumption of energy and energy efficiency of the process. Herein, we suggest the potential use of DSC analysis and ANN techniques as a powerful combination to obtain information about food products and process design. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Xanthomonas citri pv. viticola.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Plant Health Panel performed a pest categorisation of Xanthomonas citri pv. viticola (Nayudu) Dye, a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the Xanthomonadaceae family. The pathogen is a well-defined taxonomic unit and is the causal agent of the leaf spot and bacterial canker of Vitis vinifera. This bacterium is present in India and Brazil, where it affects table grape cultivation; the same pathogen is able to cause a disease on Azadirachta indica and on some weed species. Reports indicate that the bacterium is present in Thailand as well. The pathogen has never been reported from the EU territory and it is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. The pathogen can be detected on its host plants using direct isolation, serological or PCR-based methods. Its identification is achieved using biochemical and nutritional assays, together with a multilocus sequence analysis based on seven housekeeping genes. The main pathway for the entry of the pathogen into the EU territory is plant propagation material. In the EU, there is large availability of host plants, with grapevine being one of the most important crops in Europe and more specifically in its Mediterranean areas. Since X. citri pv. viticola is only reported in tropical and subtropical areas (BSh and Aw climatic zones according to the Koppen-Geiger classification), there is uncertainty whether the climatic conditions in the EU territory are suitable for its establishment. Nevertheless, due to the great importance of grapevine for the EU agriculture, any disease outbreak may have a high-economic impact. Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into the EU. X. citri pv. viticola satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Oligonychus mangiferus.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the mango red spider mite, Oligonychus mangiferus (Rahman and Sapra, 1940) (Acari: Prostigmata: Tetranychidae), for the territory of the EU. This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. The polyphagous mite feeds on more than 50 host plants including tropical fruits such as mangoes and avocados and temperate fruits such as pears, peaches, pomegranates and grapes. It occurs in Africa, Asia, Oceania and South America. O. mangiferus is multivoltine and can develop throughout the year as long as temperatures are above 12 °C. The species produces dense webs on the above-ground parts of their host plants, where all stages of development (egg, larva, nymph and adult) can be found. This species is considered a pest of mango, grapevine, lychee and pomegranate, mostly in areas with hotter climates than those occurring in the EU. Potential entry pathways for O. mangiferus include plants for planting with foliage, fruit and cut flowers. Plants for planting of a few hosts (i.e. Pinus, Prunus, Pyrus, Rosa, Vitis and Arecaceae) are banned from entering into the EU from countries where O. mangiferus is known to occur and can be considered as closed entry pathways. However, other plants for planting, as well as the fruit and the cut flowers pathways remain open. There are no EU records of interception. Should O. mangiferus enter the EU, the ample availability of hosts and the climatic conditions in the EU would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread, at least in southern MSs, where economic impact in different fruit production (e.g.pomegranate, mango and grape) is anticipated. O. mangiferus satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					The EFSA Plant Health Panel performed a pest categorisation of Fusarium brachygibbosum Padwick. F. brachygibbosum is a well-characterised fungal plant pathogen with opportunistic behaviour, mostly isolated along with other fungal pathogens in symptomatic hosts. It has been reported from Africa, America, Asia and Oceania where it is has been associated with a wide range of symptoms on approximately 25 cultivated and non-cultivated plant species. The pathogen has been reported in Italy in soil/marine sediments and in quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) and durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) seeds. The pathogen is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This pest categorisation focused on a selected range of host plant species on which F. brachygibbosum fulfilled Koch′s postulates and was formally identified by multilocus gene sequencing analysis. Host plants for planting, seed of host plants and soil and other substrates originating in infested third countries are main pathways for the entry of the pathogen into the EU. There are no reports of interceptions of F. brachygibbosum in the EU. Host availability and climate suitability factors occurring in the EU are favourable for the establishment of the pathogen in Member States (MSs). Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into the EU. Additional measures are available to mitigate the risk of entry and spread of the pathogen in the EU. Despite the low aggressiveness observed in some reported hosts, it has been shown that, in the areas of its present distribution, the pathogen has a direct impact on certain hosts (e.g. almond, onion, soybean, tobacco) that are also relevant for the EU. The Panel concludes that F. brachygibbosum satisfies all the criteria to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. However, high uncertainty remains regarding the distribution of the pathogen in the EU and some uncertainty exists about its potential impact in the EU.Specific surveys and re-evaluation of Fusarium isolates in culture collections could reduce these uncertainties. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Leucinodes pseudorbonalis.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the snout moth Leucinodes pseudorbonalis Mally, Korycinska, Agassiz, Hall, Hodgetts & Nuss (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), for the territory of the EU. This species is not included in the EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This oligophagous species, which feeds on fruit and leaves of Solanum aethiopicum (Ethiopian eggplant) and S. melongena (eggplant), is known to occur in sub-Saharan Africa (Angola, Liberia, Senegal, Uganda). Adults oviposit on leaves and newly hatched caterpillars can bore into shoots, causing wilting and dieback, before moving into the fruit, which they tunnel. Damage may be visible only if the fruit is cut open. A single aubergine can be infested by up to 20 larvae. Mature larvae abandon the fruit to pupate in a cocoon in the soil. Adult moths fly for short distances only in darkness. Potential entry pathways for L. pseudorbonalis, such as Solanum spp. Plants for planting and soil/growing media are regulated and can be considered as closed. The fruit and leaves pathways remain open from countries where L. pseudorbonalis is known to occur. Indeed, this species was intercepted in the EU with S. aethiopicum eight times from January to June 2021. Should L. pseudorbonalis enter the EU, host availability (S. melongena) and climatic conditions in some limited areas of southern EU Member States could allow this species to successfully establish and spread within these areas. Economic impact in aubergine production is anticipated if establishment occurs. L. pseudorbonalis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. Because this is a recently described species, there are knowledge gaps related to the biology of this moth and its distribution. However, these gaps do not affect the conclusions of this categorisation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Colletotrichum plurivorum.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Plant Health Panel performed a pest categorisation of Colletotrichum plurivorum Damm, Alizadeh & Toy. Sato, a well-defined fungus of the C. orchidearum species complex which has been reported from Africa, Asia and America to cause anthracnose and pre-and post-harvest fruit rots on more than 30 plant genera. The pathogen has not been reported from the EU territory and is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. Because of the very wide host range, this pest categorisation focused on Abelmoschus esculentus, Capsicum spp., Carica papaya, Glycine max, Manihot esculenta, Phaseolus lunatus, Pyrus bretschneideri and Vitis spp. For which there was robust evidence that C. plurivorum was formally identified by morphology and multilocus gene sequencing analysis. Host plants for planting and fresh fruits are the main pathways for the entry of the pathogen into the EU. The host availability and climate suitability factors occurring in some parts of the EU are favourable for the establishment of the pathogen. Economic impact on the production of the main hosts is expected if establishment occurs. Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent the introduction of the pathogen into the EU. Colletotrichum plurivorum satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Malus domestica plants from Ukraine.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as "High risk plants, plant products and other objects"). This Scientific Opinion covers plant health risks posed by 1- to 3-year-old dormant grafted plants and rootstocks of Malus domestica imported from Ukraine, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Ukraine. All pests associated with the commodity were evaluated against specific criteria for their relevance for this opinion. Two quarantine pests (Lopholeucaspis japonica and Tobacco ringspot virus), one protected zone quarantine pest (Erwinia amylovora) and one non-regulated pest (Eotetranychus prunicola) that fulfilled all relevant criteria were selected for further evaluation. For Erwinia amylovora, for which special requirements are specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072, Annex X, item 9, the fulfilment of these requirements was evaluated. Based on the information provided in the dossier, the specific requirements for Erwinia amylovora were not met. For the three remaining selected pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Ukraine were evaluated taking into account the possible limiting factors. For the selected pests, an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The degree of pest freedom varies among the pests evaluated, with Eotetranychus prunicola being the pest most frequently expected on the imported plants. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated with 95% certainty that between 9,912 and 10,000 bundles (consisting of 50 plants each) per 10,000 would be free from Eotetranychus prunicola. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Leucinodes orbonalis.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the eggplant fruit and shoot borer, Leucinodes orbonalisGuenee, (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), for the territory of the EU. L. orbonalis is a tropical and sub-tropical species native to Asia and Australia with India considered its centre of origin. Following taxonomic revision, literature reporting L. orbonalis from sub-Saharan Africa should be regarded as referring to members of a complex of other species of Leucinodes native to Africa and not as referring to L. orbonalis. L. orbonalis is not present in the EU and is not a regulated EU pest. L. orbonalis is a major pest of Solanum melongena (eggplant) in Asia where larvae feed within leaves, stems, shoots and fruits. Larvae can also feed on a range of other plants, mostly within Solanaceae although L. orbonalis is generally not reported as a pest of crops other than S. melongena. However, in recent years L. orbonalis has emerged as a pest of Solanum tuberosum in south-west India. In tropical areas there can be 10 generations per year if conditions are suitable. L . orbonalis has been intercepted 350 times in the EU from a range of Asian countries on a range of produce, mostly larvae in fruits of S. melongena. Biotic factors (host availability) and abiotic factors (climate suitability) suggest that some small areas of the EU could be suitable for establishment. Adult L. orbonalis can fly and the species could spread within the EU. The introduction of L. orbonalis into the EU would have an economic impact, most likely on S. melongena production, the magnitude of which is uncertain. Measures are available to prevent the entry of L. orbonalis into the EU. L. orbonalis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Retithrips syriacus.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the black vine thrips, Retithrips syriacus (Thysanoptera: Thripidae), for the EU territory. This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This polyphagous species feeds, among others, on apple, avocado, banana, cotton, grapevine, persimmon, pear, walnut and other plants cultivated in the EU. R. syriacus occurs in several African and Asian countries and in Florida (USA), the Caribbean and Brazil, in a range of climates some of which also occur in the EU. It can complete up to seven generations per year. It overwinters at the adult stage in the soil. Adult females lay up to 60 eggs in 5-10days in the leaf tissue or less frequently on the leaf surface. Larvae and adults feed usually on the lower side of leaves. Larvae then drop down, enter the soil, and pupate. Potential entry pathways for R. syriacus, such as plants for planting, cut flowers and fruits, exist. Soil can be considered as a closed pathway. The pest is not known to be present in the EU territory and there are no reports of interceptions. Should R. syriacus arrive in the EU, the availability of hosts and occurrence of potentially suitable climates would be conducive for establishment. Should this species establish in the EU, yield and quality losses in several fruit trees production is anticipated. R. syriacus satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Colletotrichum fructicola.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Plant Health Panel performed a pest categorisation of Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., a well-defined polyphagous fungus of the C. gloeosporioides complex which has been reported from all the five continents to cause anthracnose, bitter rot and leaf spotting diseases on over 90 cultivated and non-cultivated woody or herbaceous plant species. The pathogen is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. Because of the very wide host range, this pest categorisation focused on Camellia sinensis, Citrus sinensis, C. reticulata, Fragaria* ananassa, Malus domestica, M. pumila, Persea americana, Prunus persica, Pyrus pyrifolia and P. bretschneiderifor which there was robust evidence that C. fructicolawas formally identified by morphology and multilocus gene sequencing analysis. Host plants for planting and fresh fruits are the main pathways for the entry of the pathogen into the EU. There are no reports of interceptions of C. fructicola in the EU. The pathogen has been reported from Italy and France. The host availability and climate suitability factors occurring in some parts of the EU are favourable for the establishment of the pathogen. Economic impact on the production of the main hosts is expected if establishment occurs. Phytosanitary measures are available to prevent the re-introduction of the pathogen into the EU. Although the pathogen is present in the EU, there is a high uncertainty on its actual distribution in the territory because of the re-evaluation of Colletotrichum taxonomy and the lack of systematic surveys. Therefore, the Panelcannot conclude with certainty on whether C. fructicola satisfies the criterium of being present but not widely distributed in the EU to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest unless systematic surveys for C. fructicola are conducted and Colletotrichumisolates from the EU in culture collections are re-evaluated. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Phenacoccus solenopsis.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of Phenacoccus solenopsis (Hemiptera: Pseudococcidae) for the European Union (EU) territory. This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. P. solenopsis is native to North America and has spread to all continents except Antarctica. It has recently been reported from Cyprus, Greece and Italy. This mealybug is a polyphagous pest, feeding on about 300 plant species. It usually feeds on aerial plant parts, especially new growth, but also occurs on roots, and is often associated with ants. It is an economically important pest of ornamentals, such as hibiscus and lantana, glasshouse vegetable crops, mainly bell pepper, tomato and eggplant, and field crops, such as cotton. Large populations cause die-back and reduction in yield. Adult and immature P. solenopsis could enter the EU with imported fresh fruit, vegetables and cut flowers, although the main pathway of introduction is likely to be plants for planting. Host availability and climate suitability indicate that most of the EU would be suitable for establishment. The main natural dispersal stage is the first instar, which crawls over the plant or may be dispersed further by wind and animals. All stages may be transported over longer distances in trade. Phytosanitary measures are available and should prevent further introductions and slow the spread within the EU. P. solenopsis is under official control in Cyprus and has recently been reported in Greece and Italy. Assuming that these reports reflect a limited distribution, and P. solenopsis shortly comes under official control, it would satisfy all the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Resseliella citrifrugis.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the citrus fruit midge, Resseliella citrifrugis Jiang (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), for the territory of the EU. This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. This oligophagous species, which feeds on Citrus spp. Fruits, is known to occur in China (provinces of Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Sichuan). First-generation adults emerge in April and oviposit on the peduncle and calyx of citrus fruits. Larvae feed on the albedo (the white layer between skin and pulp) of the fruit, which they tunnel. Infested fruit most often drop prematurely. Larvae pupate either within the fallen fruit or in the soil. This species has three main peaks of activity (May, June-July, August-September) and four generations per year in its native range. Mature larvae from the last generation are the overwintering stage. Potential entry pathways for R. citrifrugis, such as Citrus spp. plants for planting with foliage and soil/growing media, and soil/growing media can be considered as closed. The citrus fruit pathway remains open from countries where R. citrifrugis is known to occur. Indeed, this species was intercepted in fresh pomelos 11 times from December 2020 to January 2021 in the EU.Should R. citrifrugis enter the EU, the ample availability of hosts (Citrus spp.) and the climatic conditions in citrus-growing areas of southern EU Member States would most probably allow this species to successfully establish and spread. Economic impact in citrus production is anticipated if establishment occurs. R. citrifrugis satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. There is uncertainty about the nomenclature of R. citrifrugis and its exact host range. However, because the name Resseliella citrifrugis is used in multiple sources reporting it as a pest of citrus in China, where symptoms, biology and impact are described, these uncertainties do not affect the conclusions of this categorisation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Phlyctinus callosus.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of Phlyctinus callosus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) for the EU territory. This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. P. callosus is a polyphagous pest native to South Africa which has spread to Australia and New Zealand, Reunion and St Helena. Immature development takes place in the soil where larvae feed on the roots of a variety of plants including grasses, root vegetables and herbaceous plants; adults are noted as significant pests of apples, nectarines and grapes, feeding on foliage and the surface of fruit causing scarring. Soft fruits such as strawberries and blueberries can also be damaged by adult feeding. P. callosus has been intercepted in Europe on apples and peaches from South Africa. Table grapes could also provide a pathway for entry to the EU. Rooted plants for planting could also provide a potential pathway. Hosts are grown widely across the EU in areas with climates comparable to those in parts of South Africa, New Zealand and Australia where the pest is established suggesting that conditions in the EU are suitable for the establishment of P. callosus. If introduced into the EU, natural spread would be limited because adults cannot fly and must disperse by walking. However, the movement of host plants for planting within the EU could spread juvenile stages much faster and adults could spread with fruits. The prohibition of soil or growing media from third countries should prevent the entry of P. callosusI larvae and pupae. Other phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit the entry of P. callosus. P. callosus satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Elasmopalpus lignosellus.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to conduct a pest categorisation of Elasmopalpus lignosellus (Zeller) (Leipidoptera: Pyralidae) for the territory of the EU following interceptions of the organism within the EU and its addition to the EPPO Alert List. E. lignosellus feeds on over 70 species; hosts include cereals, especially maize, legumes, brassicas and a range of grasses. Seedlings of ornamental and forest trees can also be hosts. E. lignosellus is established in tropical and subtropical areas of North, Central and South America. Eggs are usually laid in the soil or on the lower stem of hosts. Larvae develop in the soil and feed on roots and stems causing stunting and yield losses. Plants for planting, rooted with growing media, or with stems cut close to the soil, and fresh vegetables harvested with stems, such as asparagus and cabbage, provide pathways for entry. Population development is favoured by dry and hot conditions (27-33 °C). Adults fly and can be carried in air currents. Adults are recorded from temperate areas within the Americas contributing some uncertainty regarding the limits of its establishment potential in the EU. Although cultivated and wild hosts are distributed across the EU, impacts are likely to be confined to production areas on sandy soils around the coastal Mediterranean during hot dry years. Phytosanitary measures are available to inhibit the entry of E. lignosellus. E. lignosellus satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Amyelois transitella.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of the navel orangeworm, Amyelois transitella (Lepidoptera: Pyralidae), for the EU. This polyphagous species feeds on citrus, almonds, pistachios, grapes and other crops cultivated in the EU. A. transitella occurs in North, Central and South America in a range of climates some of which also occur in the EU. Adult females lay up to 200 eggs on overripe, damaged, cracked or mummified fruits or nuts. In citrus, eggs are laid at the navel end of damaged fruit. On occasions, they may be found on adjacent leaves or stems. This species is not included in EU Commission Implementing Regulation 2019/2072. Potential entry pathways for A. transitella, such as plants for planting, and fruit, exist. The pest is not known to be present in the EU territory although it has been intercepted in Italy and Austria. Should A. transitella arrive in the EU the availability of hosts and occurrence of potentially suitable climates would be conducive for establishment. Should this species establish in the EU, yield and quality losses in citrus, nuts, stone and pome fruit production is anticipated. A. transitella satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for this species to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Juglans regia plants from Turkey.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as "High risk plants, plant products and other objects". This Scientific Opinion covers the plant health risks posed by 2-year-old grafted bare rooted plants for planting of Juglans regia imported from Turkey, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Turkey. The relevance of any pest for this Opinion was based on evidence following defined criteria. Two EU quarantine pests, Anoplophora chinensis and Lopholeucaspis japonica, and three pests not regulated in the EU, two insects (Garella musculana, Euzophera semifuneralis)and one fungus(Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae), fulfilled all relevant criteria and were selected for further evaluation. For these pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Turkey were evaluated by considering the possible limiting factors. For these pests, an expert judgement was given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pests, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. While the estimated degree of pest freedom varied among pests, Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae was the pest most frequently expected on the commodity. The expert knowledge elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that 9,554 or more grafted bare rooted plants per 10,000 will be free fromLasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Corylus avellana and Corylus colurna plants from Serbia.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as "High risk plants, plant products and other objects". This Scientific Opinion covers the plant health risks posed by the two following hazelnut commodities to be imported from Serbia. 1. Bare rooted plants: 1-to 3-year-old plants of Corylus avellana or C. avellana grafted on C. colurna, without leaves. 2. Plants in pots: 2-year-old plants of C. avellana, without leaves. The assessment was performed by taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Serbia. The relevance of any pest for this Opinion was based on evidence following defined criteria. One EU quarantine pest, i.e.Flavescence doree phytoplasma, fulfilled all relevant criteria and was selected for further evaluation. For this pathogen, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the Technical Dossier from Serbia were evaluated separately for bare rooted plants and for plants in pots, taking into account the possible limiting factors. For the selected pathogen, an expert judgement was given on the likelihood of pest freedom of plants for planting, for both commodities taken together, considering the risk mitigation measures, including uncertainties associated with the assessment.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Scientific opinion on the import of Musa fruits as a pathway for the entry of non-EU Tephritidae into the EU territory.		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Plant Health examined evidence as to whether the import of fruits of Musa (bananas and plantains) could provide a pathway into the EU for Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel) (Diptera: Tephritidae) or other non-EU Tephritidae for which Musa is a host. Relevant scientific and technical information, including unpublished information provided to the EFSA Panel on Plant Health by the European Commission from research conducted in Cabo Verde, were taken into account. The majority of EU imports of Musa fruit comes from Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica where B. dorsalis does not occur. Commercial Musa fruits are harvested at "green stage one" before they begin to ripen naturally. Postharvest processes are designed to ensure that only high quality, unripe fruit are exported. Green stage one fruit are transported to the EU in controlled conditions and stimulated to ripen when exposed to exogenous ethylene in ripening rooms in the EU. There is no evidence that any Tephritidae can naturally infest commercial varieties of Musa fruit at green stage one or earlier. When experimentally infested with eggs of Tephritidae, larvae fail to develop in green stage one fruit. Physical and chemical changes that occur during fruit ripening enable B. dorsalis and 11 other species of Tephritidae to oviposit and develop in Musa at later stages of fruit development. Reports of B. dorsalis or other Tephritidae infesting bunches of Musa fruit are a consequence of the fruit being left to develop beyond green stage one in the field. There is no evidence that commercially grown fruits of Musa, for export to the EU, provide a pathway for the entry of non-EU Tephritidae. Passengers bringing Musa fruit from countries where Tephritidae can infest ripened Musa fruit do however provide a potential pathway for the entry of non-EU Tephritidae into the EU territory. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Ullucus tuberosus tubers from Peru.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as High risk plants, plant products and other objects. This Scientific Opinion covers plant health risks posed by tubers of Ullucus tuberosus imported from Peru, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Peru. The relevance of an EU quarantine pest for this opinion was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Peru, (ii) U. tuberosus is a host of the pest and (iii) the pest can be associated with the commodity. The relevance of any other pest, not regulated in the EU, was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Peru (ii) the pest is absent in the EU; (iii) U. tuberosus is a host of the pest; (iv) the pest can be associated with the commodity and (v) the pest may have an impact and can pose a potential risk for the EU territory. There are five pests i.e.one insect (Amathynetoides nitidiventris), two nematodes (Atalodera andina and Nacobbus aberrans) and two viruses (the Andean potato latent virus (APLV) and the Potato virus T (PVT)) that fulfilled all relevant criteria were selected for further evaluation. For the five pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Peru were evaluated taking into account the possible limiting factors. For each of the five pests, an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Persea americana from Israel.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant health was requested to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in the relevant Implementing Acts as "High risk plants, plant products and other objects" (Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 establishing a provisional list of high risk plants, plant products or other objects, within the meaning of Article 42 of Regulation (EU) 2016/2031). This scientific opinion covers the plant health risks posed by the following commodities: (i) scions and (ii) grafted plants of Persea americana imported from Israel, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by the Plant Protection and Inspection Services from Israel. The relevance of an EU quarantine pest for this opinion was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Israel; (ii) P. americana is a host of the pest and (iii) the pest can be associated with the commodity. The relevance of any other pest, not regulated in the EU, was based on evidence that: (i) the pest is present in Israel; (ii) the pest is absent in the EU; (iii) P. americana is a host of the pest; (iv) the pest can be associated with the commodity and (v) the pest may have an impact and can pose a potential risk for the EU territory. Twenty-six pests (15 insects, one mite, 9 fungi and one viroid) that fulfilled all criteria were selected for further evaluation. For the 26 selected pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier were evaluated. Limiting factors on the effectiveness of the measures were documented. For each of the 26 pests, an expert judgement is given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including any uncertainties. The fungi Lasiodiplodia pseudotheobromae and Neoscytalidium dimidiatum were the pests most frequently expected on the imported commodities. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,573 and 10,000 bundles of scions per 10,000; and 9,747 and 10,000 grafted plants per 10,000 would be free of these two fungi. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Pest categorisation of Diaphorina citri.		EFSA Journal					The EFSA Panel on Plant Health performed a pest categorisation of Diaphorina citri (Hemiptera: Liviidae) (Asian citrus psyllid) for the EU. D. citri is a key pest of citrus in several countries as it is a vector of serious bacterial pathogens, the putative causal agents of Huanglongbing (HLB) also known as citrus greening. Eggs are laid on tips of growing shoots on and between unfurling leaves. Females may lay more than 800 eggs during their lives. Nymphs pass through five instars. The life cycle requires from 14 to 49 days, depending upon the season. There is no diapause, but populations are low in winter. It overwinters as an adult which may live for several months. The species completes 9-10 generations/year; however, under protected conditions, up to 16 generations have been recorded. Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2019/2072 (Annex IIA) regulates D. citri, as a quarantine pest not known to occur in the EU territory. Fruits and plants for planting provide potential pathways for entry into the EU. Climatic conditions and the availability of host plants provide conditions to support establishment in the EU. The introduction of D. citri would have an economic impact in the EU through direct but mainly indirect effects due to potential transmission of HLB. Phytosanitary measures are available to reduce the likelihood of entry. D. citri satisfies the criteria that are within the remit of EFSA to assess for it to be regarded as a potential Union quarantine pest. D. citri does not meet the criteria of occurring in the EU, nor plants for planting being the principal means of spread, for it to be regarded as a potential Union regulated non-quarantine pest. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Plant Health (PLH)				Commodity risk assessment of Ficus carica plants from Israel.		EFSA Journal					The European Commission requested the EFSA Panel on Plant Health to prepare and deliver risk assessments for commodities listed in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2019 as "High risk plants, plant products and other objects". This Scientific Opinion covers the plant health risks posed by the following commodities: i) dormant and free of leaves 1-year-old bare rooted plants and ii) free of leaves 1-year-old liners of Ficus carica imported from Israel, taking into account the available scientific information, including the technical information provided by Israel. The relevance of any pest for this opinion was based on evidence following defined criteria. Four EU quarantine pests, Euwallacea fornicatus, Hypothenemus leprieuri, Scirtothrips dorsalis and Spodoptera frugiperda, and 11 EU non-regulated pests fulfilled all relevant criteria and were selected for further evaluation. For these pests, the risk mitigation measures proposed in the technical dossier from Israel were evaluated separately for bare rooted plants and for liners, taking into account the possible limiting factors. For these pests, an expert judgement was given on the likelihood of pest freedom taking into consideration the risk mitigation measures acting on the pest, including uncertainties associated with the assessment. The estimated degree of pest freedom varied among the pests evaluated. Aonidiella orientalis and Russellaspis pustulans were the most frequently expected pests on the imported bare rooted plants, and Scirtothrips dorsalis on liners. The Expert Knowledge Elicitation indicated, with 95% certainty, that between 9,585 and 10,000 bare rooted plants per 10,000 would be free of Aonidiella orientalis and Russellaspis pustulans and between 9,456 and 10,000 liners per 10,000 would be free of Scirtothrips dorsalis. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Optimization of some extraction parameters of phenolic content from apple peels and grape seeds and enrichment of yogurt by their powders: a comparative study.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study aims to valorize the apple peels (AP) and grape seeds (GS) by the fortification of the yogurts using their powder. Firstly, the optimization of the extraction parameters for assessing maximum of total phenolic content (TPC) was achieved. Under the optimized conditions, the experimental maximum yields of TPC were 19.332.33 and 240.594.77 mg Gallic Acid Equivalents (GAE) /100 g Dry Weight (DW) for AP and GS, respectively, which was in close agreement with predicted values (19.320.91 and 242.2611.08 mg GAE/100 g DW for AP and GS, respectively). The antioxidant capacity of GS extract was better with IC50 of 12.220.89 and 225.477.10 g/ml in DPPH and phosphomolybdenum assays, respectively. Besides, powder from these by-products was incorporated into yogurt samples. The classification test revealed that the yogurt prepared with GS powder was the preferred one. Practical applications. Natural products rich in antioxidants are increasingly in demand for their use to preserve, in particular, the perishable foods such as dairy products. Apple and grape are widely consumed fruits and they generate an enormous amount of waste, including peels and seeds. These by-products are valuable sources of natural antioxidants especially the phenolic compounds. In this line, the present study aims to optimize the extraction conditions to obtain the highest PC from these by-products. Additionally, a yogurt enriched with AP and GS as natural ingredients with antioxidant virtue was produced. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Braiek, O. B.; Smaoui, S.							Chemistry, safety, and challenges of the use of organic acids and their derivative salts in meat preservation.		Journal of Food Quality					Meat industries are constantly facing new waves of changes in the consumer's nutritional trends, food safety, and quality requirements and legislations leading to an increase in interest for meat biopreservation to respond to all of these modern socioeconomic demands. Hence, to replace synthetic and/or expensive additives, new technologies in preserving meat products from microbial contamination have been established. In this context, organic acids and their salts have been considered as the most popular examples of preservatives that offer several advantages to be applied in meat industry. Here, characteristics of organic acids/salts commonly used in meat preservation were described based on the published literature. Moreover, after outlining the challenges and advantages of their use in meat industry, their current applications as meat preservatives on various meat type matrices such as beef, pork, sheep, and poultry were quite exposed based on previous and recent research works. Then, different application types were highlighted. Besides, some potent synergistic approaches based on several combinations of organic acids/salts with different existing preservative techniques are reported with an emphasised discussion of their application as possible solution tools to mainly overcome some problems linked to organic acids/salts when used solely, thus contributing to ensure the overall safety and improve the quality of meats. Finally, despite their usefulness in meat preservation, organic acids/salts may possess detrimental traits. In this context, a detailed discussion on their limits of use in meat products was provided in the last section of this paper.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Starch degradation is an important process that can increase starch utilization in some industrial applications. In many polysaccharide compounds, the addition of salt is an alternative method to enhance the structural degradation of starch by sonication. This study aimed to investigate the effect of sonication in aqueous NaCl solution on the structural degradation of cassava starch. Results. This method produces reducing sugar which its amount is relatively smaller than the amount of total dissolved solid product. The maximum total reducing sugar (TRS) was 0.365 0.005 kgm-3 (or about 7.3 mgg-1) that resulted by S50 for 60min reaction. The increase of sonication amplitude was in line with the increase of granule defect in SEM image. X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed that the degradation process was characterized by rupturing of the amorphous region. Conclusion. The structural alteration and the increase in NaCl weight suggest that this process may become a useful method for starch modification. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2406	2413	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10864					FSTA:2021-07-Le1107
J		Branco, L. C.; Rodrigues, M. V. N.; Reyes, F. G.							Effect of food processing (fish burger preparation and frying) on residual levels of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The influence of fish burger preparation and frying on residual levels of enrofloxacin (ENR) and ciprofloxacin (CIP) was evaluated. For this purpose, a high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analytical method for the quantitation of ENR and CIP residues in tilapia products (fillet, raw fish burger and fried fish burger) was developed and validated based on European and Brazilian guidelines. Sample preparation was accomplished by extraction with acidified acetonitrile followed by clean-up with hexane. Chromatographic analysis was performed on a C18 column using isocratic elution with 0.1% formic acid and acetonitrile (85:15 v:v). The analytical method showed suitable performance to quantify the residual levels of ENR and CIP in the studied matrices. No reduction in the residual levels of ENR and CIP was observed during fish burger preparation and only a 10% reduction occurred as a consequence of frying, indicating that both compounds were stable to the preparation of the fish burger and to frying conditions. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Modelling the renal excretion of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol in humans in an everyday situation.		Toxins					The dietary exposure to the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) can be assessed by human biomonitoring (HBM). Here, we assessed the relation between dietary DON intake and the excretion of its major metabolite DON-15-glucuronide (DON15GlcA) through time, in an everyday situation. For 49 volunteers from the EuroMix biomonitoring study, the intake of DON from each meal was calculated and the excretion of DON and its metabolites was analyzed for each urine void collected separately throughout a 24-h period. The relation between DON and DON15GlcA was analyzed with a statistical model to assess the residence time and the excreted fraction of ingested DON as DON15GlcA (fabs_excr). Fabs_excr was treated as a random effect variable to address its heterogeneity in the population. The estimated time in which 97.5% of the ingested DON was excreted as DON15GlcA was 12.1 h, the elimination half-life was 4.0 h. Based on the estimated fabs_excr, the mean reversed dosimetry factor (RDF) of DON15GlcA was 2.28. This RDF can be used to calculate the amount of total DON intake in an everyday situation, based on the excreted amount of DON15GlcA. We show that urine samples collected over 24 h are the optimal design to study DON exposure by HBM. © 2021 by the authors.

Live and ultrasound-inactivated Lacticaseibacillus casei modulate the intestinal microbiota and improve biochemical and cardiovascular parameters in male rats fed a high-fat diet.		Food & Function					This study aimed to evaluate the effects of ingestion of live (9 log CFU mL-1) and ultrasound-inactivated (paraprobiotic, 20 kHz, 40 min) Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 cells for 28 days on healthy parameters (biochemical and cardiovascular) and intestinal microbiota (amplicon sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA) of rats fed a high-fat diet. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups of six animals: CTL (standard diet), HFD (high-fat diet), HFD-LC (high-fat diet and live L. casei), and HFD-ILC (high-fat diet and inactivated L. casei). The administration of live and ultrasound-inactivated L. casei prevented the increase (p< 0.05) in cholesterol levels (total and LDL) and controlled the insulin resistance in rats fed a high-fat diet. Furthermore, it promoted a modulation of the intestinal microbial composition by increasing (p< 0.05) beneficial bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminoccocaceae) and decreasing (p< 0.05) harmful bacteria (Clostridiaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, and Helicobacteriacea), attenuating the effects promoted by the HFD ingestion.

J		Brander, M.; Bernauer, T.; Huss, M.							Improved on-farm storage reduces seasonal food insecurity of smallholder farmer households - evidence from a randomized control trial in Tanzania.		Food Policy					Ending hunger is a key goal of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted in 2015. This goal notwithstanding, the prevalence of severe food insecurity of the world's population has increased. It is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the seasonality of harvests leads to fluctuations in food insecurity, particularly in the lean season, the time before the harvest is brought in. We posit that addressing seasonal food insecurity requires not only increased food production, as is commonly argued, but also consideration of post-harvest losses during storage. Here we present the results of a randomized control trial on the effects of improved on-farm storage on seasonal food insecurity. Our intervention provided farming households from two districts in Tanzania with hermetic storage bags that can help reduce storage losses. Seasonal food insecurity was measured via multiple rounds of SMS-based surveys. The results show that the intervention reduced the proportion of severely food insecure households by 38% on average in the lean season, and by 20% in the full seasonal cycle. These findings demonstrate that a simple and inexpensive technology could contribute strongly to reducing seasonal food insecurity and improving smallholder farmers' year-round access to food.

Kohonen artificial neural network and multivariate analysis in the identification of proteome changes during early and long aging of bovine Longissimus dorsi muscle using SWATH mass spectrometry.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					To study proteomic changes involved in tenderization of Longissimus dorsi, Charolais heifers and bulls muscles were sampled after early and long aging (12 or 26 days). Sensory evaluation and instrumental tenderness measurement were performed. Proteins were analyzed by gel-free proteomics. By pattern recognition (principal component analysis and Kohonen's self-organizing maps) and classification (partial least squares-discriminant analysis) tools, 58 and 86 dysregulated proteins were detected after 12 and 26 days of aging, respectively. Tenderness was positively correlated mainly with metabolic enzymes (PYGM, PGAM2, TPI1, PGK1, and PFKM) and negatively with keratins. Downregulation in hemoglobin subunits and carbonic anhydrase 3 levels was relevant after 12 days of aging, while mimecan and collagen chains levels were reduced after 26 days of aging. Bioinformatics indicated that aging involves a prevalence of metabolic pathways after late and long periods. These findings provide a deeper understanding of changes involved in aging of beef and indicate a powerful method for future proteomics studies.

Food Research International					Sorghum derived 3-deoxyanthocyanins (3-DXA) are of growing interest as natural food colors due to their unique stability compared to anthocyanins, but are generally difficult to extract. Microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) can dramatically improve extraction efficiency of 3-DXA from sorghum tissue. However, condensed tannins common in some sorghums could impact MAE extractability and color properties of 3-DXA. The objective of this work was to determine how presence of condensed tannins affect MAE extractability, stability, and color properties of sorghum 3-DXA. Sorghums of varying 3-DXA profile and tannin content, as well as purified tannins, were subjected to MAE and pigment yield and profile, aqueous color properties and stability at pH 1-5 monitored over time using, UV-vis spectroscopy, colorimetry, and UPLC-MS. The relative yield of 3-DXA from tannin sorghums was higher (3-10-fold) after MAE than from non-tannin sorghum (2-fold). During MAE, condensed tannins underwent extensive oxidative depolymerization to anthocyanidins (cyanidin and 7-O-methylcyanidin), which caused the tannin-sorghum pigment extracts to have a redder hue (12-43 H°) compared to the non-tannin pigment extract (58 H°). The tannin-derived anthocyanidins transformed over time into xanthylium pigments, resulting in increased extract H°. Tannins enhanced both color intensity (pH 1) and stability (pH 3-5) of the 3-DXA over 14 days, indicating they acted as copigments. The presence of tannins in sorghum enhances MAE extractability of 3-DXA from sorghum tissue, and could also potentially enhance their functionality in aqueous food systems. However, the initial changes in extract hue properties due to tannin-derived anthocyanidins should be considered.

J		Brar, G. S.; Pozniak, C. J.; Briggs, C.; Hucl, P. J.							Combined selection of Gpc-B1 and Glu-B1 locus encoding the Bx7OE subunit for improving end-use quality of hard white wheat.		Journal of Cereal Science					Wheat in Canada is classified into nine different market classes based on attributes that impact end-use functionality. The Canada Western Hard White Spring (CWHWS) class was created in 2001 to diversify wheat production. The quality requirements of the CWHWS class demand strong gluten properties but lower grain protein (GP) content levels compared to the premium CWRS class. Generally, GP and grain yield are negatively correlated, so a reduction in GP would allow CWHWS cultivars to express greater yield potential. However, lowering GP can result in weaker gluten strength. This study investigated the combined use of Gpc-B1 and Bx7OE to increase GP while maintaining the dough strength in hard white wheat lines. Additionally, the effects of these introgressions on agronomic traits (grain yield, days to heading, days to maturity, plant height, test weight, and thousand kernel weight) were evaluated. Seven populations (each comprising 40 RILs, all varying for presence of Bx7OE, and five populations carrying all possible combinations of Gpc-B1 and Bx7OE) were developed using marker-assisted selection and elite cultivars or advanced breeding lines as parents and tested in three field environments in Saskatchewan, Canada. End-use quality was measured on grain (protein content, kernel hardness), and flour (protein, ash, protein loss, color, and farinograph). Results from our study showed a 0.8-1.1% increase in GP content relative to CWHWS cultivars (used as checks in the study) and dough strength properties similar to CWRS cultivar "CDC Teal" (representing uppermost limit of dough strength in CWRS class at the time). Except for a slight increase in plant height (still comparable to elite cultivars), no deleterious effects on agronomic or other quality traits were observed. We conclude that combined selection of Gpc-B1 DIC with Bx7OE is effective in developing CWHWS lines with a desirable end-use quality.

Characterization and control of biofilms of Salmonella Minnesota of poultry origin.		Food Bioscience					Biofilms characterize sessile form that allows bacterial maintenance under hostile conditions. Salmonella represents an important foodborne zoonotic agent, capable of forming biofilms on diverse surfaces. The emergence of Salmonella Minnesota in the Brazilian poultry production expresses the need for more specific knowledge related to its maintenance in the environment and consequent food contamination, as well as control measures. Our approach combines the analysis of genetic determinants linked to biofilm formation and the phenotypic study of biomass on different surfaces, together with the determination of the effect of chemical agents on the control of sessile structure. It also evaluates the genetic similarity profile of 29 S. Minnesota strains isolated from food and Environmental samples in two full-cycle poultry industries from 2009 to 2014. Genetic analysis showed low heterogeneity with the identification of six clonal groups, three clusters with homology greater than 80% and seven distinct genotypes. It was compatible with the presence of important genes in biofilm formation, with 28/29 (97.0%) presenting adrA and csgD and 27 (93.0%) presenting the luxS gene. Allied to this, 19/29 of the strains (66.0%) presented biomass that varied the intensity in weak (9/19-47.0%), moderate (6/19-32.0%) and strong (4/19-21.0%), with characteristic ultrastructure of a mature biofilm. Sodium hypochlorite showed greater efficiency in the control of sessile cells, even after incubation process. The study shows the presence of biofilm-producing S. Minnesota characterizing the problem of persistence in broiler slaughterhouses and indicates as a control strategy the use of sodium hypochlorite in an appropriate manner.

Food Chemistry					The colorimetric sensors for reducing sugars based on a redox reaction between AuCl4- ions and fructose, glucose, lactose, or mannose are presented. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) that formed at room temperature as a product of this reaction were registered using a spectrophotometer. Lengthening reaction time had a positive effect on the sensitivity of the developed sensors. Different reducing sugars exhibited distinct reaction rates for AuNP formation, with the rate decreasing in the order fructose > glucose > lactose > mannose. LOD values after 60 min of the reaction for different sugars followed the same trend of 0.067, 0.081, 0.087, and 0.106 mM, while LOQ was 0.223, 0.270, 0.289, and 0.353 mM, respectively. The linear range 60 min since the start of the reaction varied from 0.3 up to 5.0 mM for different sugars.

J		Brasoveanu, M.; Nemtanu, M. R.; Ticos, D.							Influence of the sample loading on the contribution of competitive effects for granular starch exposed to radio-frequency plasma.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Plasma treatment can modify starch through two competitive reactions, crosslinking and depolymerization (degradation), depending on the experimental conditions. This work intends to clarify how the load of starch could play an important role in the dominant effect of the two reactions that occur during plasma treatment of starch. Therefore, different quantities of granular starch on the surface unit were exposed to the radio-frequency (RF) plasma under the same experimental conditions (13.56 MHz, 40 W, 10 min, in air). Properties such as pH, paste clarity, colorimetric and spectral features, and rheological behavior have changed with different patterns after exposure of starch to plasma, depending on the Sample loading. As a result, a process model was discussed. It considered hypothetically that only a layer of the sample surface was strongly degraded while the sample rest underwent the crosslinking process. It proved that crosslinking can occur preponderantly when the load of sample increases. Industrial relevance Plasma treatment is an emerging and environmentally friendly method used recently to modify the functional properties of native starch. These changes are generally caused through two major competitive processes-crosslinking and degradation-depending on the experimental conditions (i.e., type of plasma generation, gas composition, sample preparation, voltage levels, exposure time). The question is whether the Sample loading, defined as the quantity of native starch placed as a uniform layer on the surface unit, might play a significant role in the predominant effect of these competitive reactions. Thus, in order to elucidate the role of the Sample loading as an input factor of the plasma treatment, we investigated the relationship between the induced-plasma effects and the Sample loading of granular starch. The findings showed that starch properties can be changed with different patterns after exposure of starch to plasma, depending on the Sample loading. A process model was brought to the reader's attention. It considered that only a layer of the sample surface was strongly degraded while the rest of the sample underwent crosslinking process. It proved that crosslinking can occur preponderantly when the load of the sample increases. Noteworthy that the Sample loading as an input factor must be taken into account in the technological design of starch exposure to plasma since it may significantly influence the manner in which starch is modified.

Trends in Food Science & Technology					Background. Carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is an evergreen tree that belongs to the Leguminosae family and is typical of the Mediterranean basin. It is well known for its valuable locust bean gum obtained from carob seeds. However, the food industry can obtain different carob products from carob fruit after processing. Carob products are good sources of dietary fibre, sugars, and a range of bioactive compounds such as polyphenols and D-pinitol. Scope and approach. Bioactive compounds present in carob fruit and its derived products help control many health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, and gastrointestinal disorders due to their anti-hyperglycaemic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities. So, carob products have a great potential to be used as a functional food ingredient. Key findings and conclusions. This article focuses on carob characteristics and processing, chemical composition, health benefits, and applications in food formulations to explore the potential of carob in developing a wide variety of health-beneficial food products.

Quality of traditionally produced Istrian sausage and identification of autochthonous lactic acid bacteria strains as potential functional starter cultures.		European Food Research and Technology					Fermented sausages have been manufactured traditionally in the Mediterranean basin. Istrian sausages are one of the many regionally specific products distinguished by the specific traditional recipes and consequentially exceptional sensory characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensory, physico-chemical and microbiological changes occurring during production and ripening of Istrian sausages made at traditional households, and to compare the results obtained with the identical product produced in industrial conditions. Additional goal was to characterise the autochthonous lactic acid bacteria populations and to obtain the candidate starter strains. Production stages and product ripening parameters could be strictly defined in controlled industrial conditions of the production process, and the results of this study can serve to standardise the production of traditional Istrian sausages. The results from sensory and physico-chemical examination do not show differences in relation to sausages of a similar type investigated in other papers. Lactic acid bacteria were favoured during fermentation at rising salt concentrations, consisting mostly of Lactobacillus strains followed with the abundance of coagulase-negative cocci. Further, we targeted the autochthonous lactic LAB population to select the candidate starter strains for controlled sausage fermentation. Fifty Gram-positive strains with catalase-negative phenotype, rod-shape or cocci morphology, effective acidification kinetics and production of lactic acid identified by sequence analysis of 16S rRNA were considered LAB. The selected LAB strains were able to grow in a range of pH values and high salt concentration important for their metabolic activity during sausage fermentation. According to our results, Lactobacillus sakei, which is a prevalent strain during fermentation of various types of fermented sausages, was frequently detected. Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus curvatus were also detected in abundance, implying their possible competitiveness among the complex microbial population. Isolated autochthonous strains L. curvatus S30, L. sakei S32 and L. plantarum S50 produced high lactic acid concentrations, tolerated NaCl concentrations present during sausage fermentation, survived at high concentrations of hydrogen ions and inhibited six pathogens associated with contamination of meat products in a strain-specific manner. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Control					Breast milk substitutes, e.g. infant formulae, are commonly introduced to the diet within the first months of life. As the infants' detoxifying capability is not fully developed, it is of vital importance to minimize their exposure to food contaminants. Here, we present a comprehensive multi-mycotoxin assessment in infant food. Samples from the Austrian and Czech market (n = 59) were screened for 46 mycotoxins and key metabolites using two complementary LC-MS/MS methods. Trace levels of 17 mycotoxins, including aflatoxin B1 (0.4 mug/kg), zearalenone (<2.3 mug/kg), deoxynivalenol (<131 mug/kg) and fumonisin B1 (<39 mug/kg) were detected. Infant formulae were contaminated at lower levels compared to cereal-based products. Overall, the concentrations of most toxins were near or below their respective LOQ values. However, two raw flour samples exceeded the regulatory limit of aflatoxin B1 for infant foods. Interestingly, two toxins not reported previously, namely aflatoxicol and sterigmatocystin, were identified in 3 and 17% of infant foods, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The occurrence of microplastic (MP) in food products, such as beverages in plastic bottles, is of high public concern. Existing analytical methods focus on the determination of particle numbers, requiring elaborate sampling tools, laboratory infrastructure and generally time-consuming imaging detection methods. A comprehensive routine analysis of MP in food products is still not possible. In the present work, we present the development of a smart filter crucible as sampling and detection tool. After filtration and drying of the filtered-off solids, a direct determination of the MP mass content from the crucible sample can be done by thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectroscopy (TED-GC/MS). The new filter crucible allows a filtration of MP down to particle sizes of 5 m. We determined MP contents below 0.01 g/L up to 2 g/L, depending on beverages bottle type. This may be directly related to the bottle type, especially the quality of the plastic material of the screw cap. Dependent on the plastic material, particle formation increases due to opening and closing operations during the use phase. However, we have also found that some individual determinations of samples were subjected to high errors due to random events. A conclusive quantitative evaluation of the products is therefore not possible at present. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	4	691	700	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1889042					FSTA:2021-08-Ha7692

Effect of wet grinding and drying of the nixtamal on physicochemical, morphologic, and vibrational properties of flours and rheological changes of masa.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Nixtamalization process conditions such as grinding and drying increases stiffness in the starch; consequently, swollen capacity, water binding capacity, and water solubility index decrease. These affect cohesion characteristics, flow behavior, and textural parameters of flour, masa, and tortilla. The aim of this study was to evaluate the changes in physicochemical, morphologic, and vibrational properties of flours and masa considering the variation of drying and milling conditions. Water absorption index and water solubility index changes are attributed to nixtamal wet grinding. Scanning electronic microscopy analysis showed starch granules with greater gelatinization. Pasting profile analysis and changes observed in IR spectra indicate that drying and grinding methods are influential in the quality of flours. The study of masa rheological parameters indicated that drying influenced masa viscoelasticity. These results showed that drying temperature and wet grinding of nixtamal are necessary conditions to obtain flour and masa and determine the quality of its products. Practical applications. Mills discs distance and nixtamal drying temperature are process conditions that influence physical, chemical, and structural changes of the starch, which modify the rheological behavior of flours and masa. Likewise, tortilla is a food of greater consumption among the Mexican population, and its textural quality depends on flour and masa quality. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15415					FSTA:2021-09-Mq5430

M.k			The PHYTOME Consortium				Replacement of nitrite in meat products by natural bioactive compounds results in reduced exposure to N-nitroso compounds: the PHYTOME project.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. It has been proposed that endogenously form N-nitroso compounds (NOCs) are partly responsible for the link between red meat consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. As nitrite has been indicated as critical factor in the formation of NOCs, the impact of replacing the additive sodium nitrite (E250) by botanical extracts in the PHYTOME project is evaluated. Method and Results. A human dietary intervention study is conducted in which healthy subjects consume 300 g of meat for 2 weeks, in subsequent order: conventional processed red meat, white meat, and processed red meat with standard or reduced levels of nitrite and added phytochemicals. Consumption of red meat products enriched with phytochemicals leads to a significant reduction in the faecal excretion of NOCs, as compared to traditionally processed red meat products. Gene expression changes identify cell proliferation as main affects molecular mechanism. High nitrate levels in drinking water in combination with processed red meat intake further stimulates NOC formation, an effect that could be mitigated by replacement of E250 by natural plant extracts. Conclusion. These findings suggest that addition of natural extracts to conventionally processed red meat products may help to reduce CRC risk, which is mechanistically support by gene expression analyses. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Brendel, R.; Schwolow, S.; Rohn, S.; Weller, P.							Volatilomic profiling of citrus juices by dual-detection HS-GC-MS-IMS and machine learning - an alternative authentication approach.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A prototype dual-detection headspace-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-ion mobility spectrometry (HS-GC-MS-IMS) system was used for the analysis of the volatile profile of 47 Citrus juices including grapefruit, blood orange, and common sweet orange juices without requiring any sample pretreatment. Next to reduced measurement times, substance identification could be improved substantially in case of co-elution by considering the characteristic drift times and m/ z ratios obtained by IMS and MS. To discriminate the volatile profiles of the different juice types, extensive data analysis was performed with both datasets, respectively. By principal component analysis (PCA), a distinct separation between grapefruit and orange juices was observed. While in the IMS data grapefruit juices not from fruit juice concentrate could be separated from grapefruit juices reconstituted from fruit juice concentrate, in the MS data, the blood orange juices could be differentiated from the orange juices. This observation leads to the assumption that the IMS and MS data contain different information about the composition of the volatile profile. Subsequently, linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machines (SVM), and the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) algorithm were applied to the PCA data as supervised classification methods. Best results were obtained by LDA after repeated cross-validation for both datasets, with an overall classification and prediction ability of 96.9 and 91.5% for the IMS data and 94.5 and 87.9% for the MS data, respectively, which confirms the results obtained by PCA. Additional data fusion could not generally improve the model prediction ability compared to the single data, but rather for certain juice classes. Consequently, depending on the juice class, the most suitable dataset should be considered for the prediction of the class membership. This volatilomic approach based on the dual detection by HS-GC-MS-IMS and machine learning tools represent a simple and promising alternative for future authenticity control of citrus juices.										2021	69	5	1727	1738	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07447					FSTA:2021-06-Hq5994
J		Brenn, C.; Schroder, U.; Hanel, R.; Arbizu, P. M.							A multiplex real-time PCR screening assay for routine species identification of four commercially relevant crustaceans.		Food Control					Adulteration or mislabelling of seafood products Is a major issue and a problem prevalent worldwide. DNA sequencing-based methods currently used for species identification help to reveal adulteration, but drawbacks like their requirement for sophisticated equipment, which is not available in every food monitoring laboratory, or their time-consumption render most of them insufficient for routine analysis. This paper presents a TaqMan-probe based multiplex real-time PCR screening assay for identification of the four commercially relevant crustacean species Penaeus monodon, Litopenaeus vannamei, Pleoticus muelleri and Nephrops norvegicus. All newly developed primer/probe sets of the multiplex real-time PCR assay exhibited a limit of detection between 0.2 pg-2 pg DNA and amplification efficiencies in a range of 97.1-100.9%. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by testing more than 30 crustacean species demonstrating the great potential for a reliable species identification. In addition, the performance of the method was evaluated with varyingly processed crustaceans as well as with commonly used spices and herbs.

J		Brenz, F.; Linke, S.; Simat, T. J.							Linear and cyclic oligomers in PET, glycol-modified PET and Tritan used for food contact materials.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Polyesters are commonly used as food contact materials. During manufacture of polyesters different low molecular mass oligomers (<1000 Da) are formed in the polymer melt. These so-called non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) are potential migrants into foods. In this work, different polyester samples made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glycol-modified PET (PETG) and Tritan were investigated on their qualitative and quantitative oligomer composition. The analysis of acetonitrile extracts by HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS revealed the presence of about 100 linear (different combinations of hydroxyl-, carboxyl-, methyl ester end groups) and cyclic oligomers depending on the main and co-monomers. The identified oligomers were quantified in different extracts and after reprecipitation by HPLC-DAD using bis-hydroxyethylene terephthalate (BHET) as external standard. The amount of oligomers isolated by reprecipitation ranged between 0.80 and 3.4% in the respective polyester. Cyclic oligomers generally made up 90% or more of the isolated oligomers. Compared to the exhaustive extracts the leaching of oligomers into 20% ethanol (1 h, 60 °C) resulted in a considerable change of the oligomer distribution with a predominant detection of linear oligomers. This suggests linear oligomers to be relevant for migration into aqueous foods despite the dominant amount of extractable cyclic oligomers in polyesters. Analysis of the extractable oligomers of a PET preform and a PETG container and their corresponding raw material pellets revealed that the injection moulding process did not significantly change the amount of cyclic oligomers but did increase the amount of low molecular mass linear oligomers about twofold. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	1	160	179	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1828626					FSTA:2021-05-Fe1169

Italian Journal of Food Science					This study investigated the effects of water and content of solid particles, taken together as well as separately, on stability of veiled olive oil. The following oil samples were obtained through four different separation treatments: veiled, filtered, "solid-only", and "water-only". Changes in chemical, microbial, and sensory characteristics were evaluated during storage (240 days). A significant effect of hydrolysis was shown in veiled and "water only" oils; in "solid-only" oils, a slow increase of phenols was observed. A notable microbial activity, with resulting formation of volatile metabolites and sensory defects, was observed in veiled samples. Filtered oils underwent less significant changes.

Formation of diastereomeric dihydromenthofurolactones by Cystostereum murrayi and aroma dilution analysis based on dynamic headspace extraction.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Submerged cultures of the basidiomycota Cystostereum murrayi emit an intensive coconut-like, sweetish, and buttery smell. For identification of the key aroma compounds, an aroma dilution analysis using dynamic headspace was performed by adjusting the split ratio of the GC inlet system. Flavor dilution (FD) factors varied from 22 up to ≥218, whereby the largest class of compounds represented terpenoids, including two rare stereoisomers of 3,6-dimethyl-2,3,3a,4,5,7a-hexahydrobenzofuran (dill ether, ee ≥ 99.9). By means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the substances with the highest FD factors (29, 212, and 218) were identified as diastereomers of 3,6-dimethyl-3a, 4,5,6,7,7a-hexayhydro-3 H-1-benzofuran-2-one (dihydromenthofurolactone) and as its corresponding C3-unsaturated lactone. The latter two compounds have not been described for C. murrayi or for any other basidiomycota previously. Supplementation studies using 2-13C-D-glucose indicated that these lactones as well as the two stereoisomers of dill ether and other terpenoids were formed de novo by the fungus.

J		Bresciani, A.; Giuberti, G.; Cervini, M.; Marti, A.							Pasta from yellow lentils: how process affects starch features and pasta quality.		Food Chemistry					The effects of conventional extrusion (CV) and extrusion-cooking (EC) were investigated on 100% yellow lentils (YL). Both the extrusion processes led to pasta with good cooking quality (cooking loss: 7.0-7.1 g/100 g, firmness: 530-608 N), even in overcooking (cooking loss: 7.7-7.9 g/100 g, firmness: 418-513 N). Contrary to what is known for gluten-free cereals, CV is effective in producing pasta from native YL with no need for a pre-gelatinization step. However, pasta from EC showed a higher compression energy (2898 versus 2448 N*mm). In this sample, starch presented a higher degree of gelatinization (75.5 versus 57.6 g/100 g) and lower enthalpy (0.97 versus 1.07 J/g). At the same time, EC promoted a more compact structure that required higher temperature for melting (66.49 versus 63.16 °C) and showing pasting properties (79.1 versus 74.7 °C). Thus, by selecting suitable extrusion conditions it is possible to improve the cooking behavior of 100% pulse pasta.

Food Chemistry					High-amylose corn alone or in combination (25% and 50%) with conventional corn was used to produce gluten-free pasta. Flour pre-gelatinization in a tank (process A) or on a conveyor belt (process B) were tested. Resistant starch (RS), soluble (SPAs) and cell-wall bound phenolic acids (CWBPAs) and antioxidant capacity were significantly higher in high-amylose corn pasta. Cooked pasta from process B showed a higher SPA concentration, likely due to the lower cooking loss. The structure of pasta prepared with process B was more homogeneous, whereas it was more compact in the case of process A, as shown by a lower starch susceptibility to alpha-amylase hydrolysis, higher beginning of gelatinization temperature and lower water absorption. 25% HA represents a good compromise between high RS (4.2%) and good cooking behavior. At higher HA levels, process B is more suitable to obtain pasta with a better cooking quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					The suitability of corn fractions (break meal: 250-500 m; flour: < 150 m) from hybrids with different amylose contents (conventional: 18%; high-amylose: 42%; waxy: 2%) and their blends, to produce co-extruded snacks was assessed. Corn flour exhibited a higher content in total soluble phenolic acids (+34%) than break meal. The high-amylose hybrid maintained a higher antioxidant capacity and phenolic acid content (+52% for soluble and+ 54% for cell-wall bound phenolic acids), even after extrusion, than the conventional one. Because of its gelatinization properties (high pasting and peak temperatures; low maximum viscosity), the high-amylose hybrid produced co-extruded snacks characterized by low section areas and large inner areas. The blends led to snacks whose features (sections and inner areas, porosity and hardness) did not follow a linear trend with the amylose content, suggesting the need for further studies to better understand the starch interactions that take place among the various hybrids.

Food Research International					Cranberries (Vaccinium macrocarpon) represent an important source of anthocyanins, flavan-3-ols and flavonols. This study aimed at investigating in vitro the human microbial metabolism of (poly)phenols, principally flavan-3-ols, of unformulated- and phytosome-formulated cranberry extracts. After powder characterization, a 24-h fermentation with human faecal slurries was performed, standardizing the concentration of incubated proanthocyanidins. Cranberry (poly)phenol metabolites were quantified by uHPLC-MS2 analyses. The native compounds of both unformulated- and phytosome-formulated cranberry extracts were metabolized under faecal microbiota activity, resulting in twenty-four microbial metabolites. Although some differences appeared when considering different classes of colonic metabolites, no significant differences in the total amount of metabolites were established after 24 h of incubation period. These results suggested that a different formulation had no effect on flavan-3-ol colonic metabolism of cranberry and both unformulated- and phytosome-formulated extract. Both formulations displayed the capability to be a potential source of compounds which could lead to a wide array of gut microbiota metabolites in vitro. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Chromatographic fingerprinting strategy to delineate chemical patterns correlated to coffee odor and taste attributes.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Coffee cupping includes both aroma and taste, and its evaluation considers several different attributes simultaneously to define flavor quality and therefore requires complementary data from aroma and taste. This study investigates the potential and limits of a data-driven approach to describe the sensory quality of coffee using complementary analytical techniques usually available in routine quality control laboratories. Coffee flavor chemical data from 155 samples were obtained by analyzing volatile (headspace-solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME-GC-MS)) and nonvolatile (liquid chromatography-ultraviolet/diode array detector (LC-UV/DAD)) fractions, as well as from sensory data. Chemometric tools were used to explore the data sets, select relevant features, predict sensory scores, and investigate the networks between features. A comparison of the Q model parameter and root-mean-squared error prediction (RMSEP) highlights the variable influence that the nonvolatile fraction has on prediction, showing that it has a higher impact on describing acid, bitter, and woody notes than on flowery and fruity. The data fusion emphasized the aroma contribution to driving sensory perceptions, although the correlative networks highlighted from the volatile and nonvolatile data deserve a thorough investigation to verify the potential of odor-taste integration.

Co-inoculation of yeasts starters: a strategy to improve quality of low altitude Arabica coffee.

Important chemical compounds and groups were analyzed by liquid and gas chromatography and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The inoculated coffees with yeast populations around 106 cell/g obtained the highest scores, and the co-inoculation with C. parapsilosis CCMA 0544 and T. delbrueckii CCMA 0684 had the highest score in the sensory analysis (85). Different descriptors were observed in each treatment, and body, flavor, balance, and aftertaste are strongly related to C. parapsilosis CCMA 0544. The fermentation process improved the quality of low-altitude coffees, and the combination of non-Saccharomyces yeasts (C. parapsilosis CCMA 0544 and T. delbrueckii CCMA 0684) was the most indicated as starter cultures.

Characterization of bioactive, chemical, and sensory compounds from fermented coffees with different yeasts species.		Food Research International					Selected yeasts for coffee fermentation are correlated with changes in chemical compounds and beverage sensory characteristics. This work aimed to evaluate the chemical and sensory modifications of coffee fermented with one yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae CCMA 0543, Candida parapsilosis CCMA 0544, or Torulaspora delbrueckii CCMA 0684) and in co-inoculation (from two to two and the three together) by dry processing. Real-time PCR analyzes, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity (DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP), liquid and gas chromatography, and sensory analysis were performed. Caparao coffees showed a higher C. parapsilosis (6.14 Log cell.g-1) population followed by S. cerevisiae (5.85 Log cell.g-1) and T. delbrueckii (4.64 Log cell.g-1). The total phenolic content has a strong and positive correlation with the fermentation time and the roasted beans and a moderate and positive correlation with DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS. Coffee inoculated with T. delbrueckii reduced caffeine concentration during the fermentation process. In co-cultivation, the trigonelline concentration showed the most significant decrease (around 4 mg.g-1) when inoculated with S. cerevisiae and T. delbrueckii. Detection of some organic acids and volatile compounds during fermentation may indicate that the starter cultures used different metabolic routes. All co-inoculation treatments presented the best sensory scores (>86 points). In the inoculated fermentation, fruity, citric, molasses, freshness, and wine notes appeared. The co-inoculated treatment with S. cerevisiae CCMA 0543, C. parapsilosis CCMA 0544, and T. delbrueckii CCMA 0684 was the best, considering the diversity of sensory notes descriptors and the final concentration of organic acids.

Mundo Novo) processed by natural and pulped natural processes.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Starter cultures during fermentation of Coffea arabica var. Mundo Novo processed in open stainless-steel vessels by natural and pulped natural methods were studied. The yeasts Meyerozyma caribbica (CCMA 0198), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (CCMA 0543), Candida parapsilosis (CCMA 0544), and Torulaspora delbrueckii (CCMA 0684) were inoculated separately in two different coffee processes: natural and pulped natural. The qPCR (real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction) was used as a culture-independent method to monitor the inoculum's permanence. Changes in microbial metabolites (organic acids and volatile) production were evaluated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), respectively. The sensory analysis was assessed in roasted beans. The fermentation lasted 27 h, and the coffee temperature ranged from 16.5 to 24.0 °C. The starter culture population was dominant throughout fermentation. S. cerevisiae (CCMA 0543) and T. delbrueckii (CCMA 0684) presented a higher population in natural processing. However, in pulped natural processing, M. caribbica (CCMA 0198) and C. parapsilosis (CCMA 0544) were the dominant populations. Citric, malic, and succinic acids were naturally present in coffee. Lactic, isobutyric, and isovaleric acids were detected at the end of the fermentation in different treatments. Lactic acid was detected in samples at the end of fermentation in Control and CCMA 0198 treatment. NAT coffee inoculated with CCMA 0684 presented isobutyric acid and isovaleric acid concentrations. Volatile compounds, such as 2,6-diethylpyrazine was detected in treatments inoculated with yeasts, but not in Controls. 2-acetoxymethylfuran was only detected in samples inoculated with CCMA 0198 from both NAT and PN methods. Samples fermented with S. cerevisiae (CCMA 0543) presented the highest sensorial scores in both processing (84.75 and 84.92). The inoculated coffee beans showed higher scores of sweetness, long aftertaste, and greater complexity. The starter cultures influenced the sensorial profiles through the synthesis of specific volatile constituents. However, considering all parameters analyzed, S. cerevisiae (CCMA 0543) would be the most suitable yeast for the var. Mundo Novo processed by both fermentation methods.

Hydration properties and arabinoxylans content of whole wheat flour intended for cookie production as affected by particle size and Brazilian cultivars.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effect of particle size (PS), cultivars (C), and their interactions (PS * C) on the hydration of whole wheat flour (WWF) intended for cookie production was evaluated by different approaches. Three Brazilian wheat cultivars and three particle sizes were evaluated. Total arabinoxylans content was affected by PS, increasing up to 6.18 times with the reduction in particle size. Water-soluble arabinoxylans were more influenced by the cultivar. The water absorption capacity by farinograph indicated that the PS had a greater influence, with high absorption in fine particle size flour. Water absorption based on swelling capacity and absorption kinetics by Enslin-Neff device evidenced high water absorption for coarse particle size flour, regardless the cultivar. ORS Vintecinco cultivar demonstrated the best hydration properties and desired quality for short-dough cookies. The different methods to predict the hydration properties of the flours resulted in different behaviors, demonstrating that the presence of outer layers of the grain of WWF promotes distinct mechanisms in the water absorption capacity, which are significantly influenced by genotype and particle size factors.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Nutraceutical compounds contribute to prevention and treatment of disease, especially cancer. The anthocyanins, yellow flavonoids, vitamin C and phenolic total compounds were quantified of tamarind pulp from Mato Grosso do Sul (MS) and Sao Paulo (SP)-Brazil. The antioxidant activity by the DPPH radical scavenging assay and the cytotoxic activity against the liver tumor cells of Rattus norvegicus were determined. The values of anthocyanins, yellow flavonoids and vitamin C (mg 100 g-1) for tamarind MS and SP were respectively: 4.22 0.10 e 4.53 0.18; 4.90 0.13 e 5.19 0.20; 62.31 1.41; 58.92 0.21. The antioxidant activity and the amount of total phenolic were greatly influenced by the place of cultivation and the type of solvent used in the extraction. Total phenolics content range from 104.77 1.21 to 255.72 3.70mg GAE 100g-1 of fresh weight. The largest amount extracted was obtained with the hydroethanolic 70:30 solvent from tamarind MS. The hydromethanolic 70:30-MS extract showed 93.99 0.20% free radical scavenging. This extract shows cytotoxic activity against tumor cells at all concentrations evaluated up to 48 h. The pulp of tamarind from MS is a promising source of bioactive compounds with antioxidant and cytotoxic/antiproliferative activities. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Comparative structural and vibrational investigations between cocoa butter (CB) and cocoa butter equivalent (CBE) by ESI/MALDI-HRMS, XRD, DSC, MIR and Raman spectroscopy.		Food Chemistry					A high quality chocolate requires not only a shiny surface, a crunchy and pleasant texture, but also a proper resistance to blooming. All these characteristics are influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the components, which are directly related to their crystalline structure. Some works found that the proportion of cocoa butter (CB), cocoa butter equivalent (CBE) and milk fatty acid (AMF) tend to strongly delay the blooming when mixing them. The goal of our research is to determine how the choice of adding CBE to the mixture delays chocolate blooming. ESI/MALDI-HRMS, X-ray, DSC, MIR and Raman investigations were used to analyze the structure features and the vibrational modes of CB and CBE. The comparison of these experimental results between CB and CBE made it possible to highlight markers of differentiation between CB and CBE which seems to explain the impact of CBE in the chocolate blooming. Part of these triglycerides remains in form IV instead. The presence of the latter seems to be a key parameter that favors the transformation deceleration to the form VI, which is responsible for the fat bloom development. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Optimization of gluten-free muffins made with pineapple peel, banana peel, and pumpkin seed flours.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The most common form of incorporating by-products from the fruit and vegetable processing into foods is flour, which can be used in various bakery products. This study aimed to optimize gluten-free (GF) muffin formulations, containing pineapple peel flour (PPF), banana peel flour (BPF), and pumpkin seed flour (PSF) using a mixture design approach, and to evaluate the physicochemical characteristics and the acceptability. The addition of PSF led to an increase in the L* value, hue angle and chroma of muffin's crust and crumb, whereas BPF decreased these parameters. The PPF determined higher total and insoluble fiber contents. The muffins with PPF and BPF had higher moisture content, whereas PSF increased the lipid content, thus reducing the firmness. The addition of BPF and PSF increased the springiness. The formulations with PPF (F1) and PPF+ PSF (F5) were the most consumers' acceptance, with interesting nutritional characteristics, allowing diversification of GF products. Practical applications. The pineapple peel flour, banana peel flour, and pumpkin seed flour can be used in the production of muffins, as a way of using by-products, leading to the diversification of products for the celiac individuals and meeting the demand of consumers for gluten-free products, with an improvement in the nutritional value. The muffin formulations made with PPF had higher insoluble fiber and total fiber contents, and was well accepted, showing the consumers' acceptance for fiber-enriched products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of substituting whey cream for sweet cream on the textural and rheological properties of cream cheese.		Journal of Dairy Science					In the manufacture of cream cheese, sweet cream and milk are blended to prepare the cream cheese mix, although other ingredients such as condensed skim milk and skim milk powder may also be included. Whey cream (WC) is an underutilized fat source, which has smaller fat droplets and slightly different chemical composition than sweet cream. This study investigated the rheological and textural properties of cream cheeses manufactured by substituting sweet cream with various levels of WC. Three different cream cheese mixes were prepared: control mix (CC; 0% WC), cream cheese mixes containing 25% WC (25WC; i.e., 75% sweet cream), and cream cheese mixes with 75% WC (75WC; i.e., 25% sweet cream). The CC, 25WC, and 75WC mixes were then used to manufacture cream cheeses. We also studied the effect of WC on the initial step in cream cheese manufacture (i.e., the acid gelation process monitored using dynamic small amplitude rheology). Acid gels were also prepared with added denatured whey proteins or membrane proteins/phospholipids (PL) to evaluate how these components affected gel properties. The rheological, textural, and sensory properties of cream cheeses were also measured. The WC samples had significantly higher levels of PL and insoluble protein compared with sweet cream. An increase in the level of WC reduced the rate of acid gel development, similar to the effect of whey phospholipid concentrate added to mixes. In cream cheese, an increase in the level of added WC resulted in significantly lower storage modulus values at temperatures <20°C. Texture results, obtained from instrumental and sensory analyses, showed that high level of WC resulted in significantly lower firmness or hardness values and higher stickiness compared with cream cheeses made with 25WC or CC cream cheeses. The softer, less elastic gels or cheeses resulting from the use of high levels of WC are likely due to the presence of components such as PL and proteins from the native milk fat globule membrane. The use of low levels of WC in cream cheese did not alter the texture, whereas high levels of WC could be used if manufacturers want to produce more spreadable products.

Detrimental effect on the gut microbiota of 1,2-dicarbonyl compounds after in vitro gastro-intestinal and fermentative digestion.		Food Chemistry					This study investigated the stability of dicarbonyl compounds (DCs), 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG), glyoxal (GO) and methylglyoxal (MGO) during simulated gastrointestinal digestion processes and the impact these compounds have on the gut microbiota. DCs pass almost unaltered through the in-vitro gastrointestinal digestion phases (concentration loss: 11% for 3-DG, 24% for GO and MGO) and have an effect on the fermentative digestion process, reducing the total gut bacterial population up to 6 Log10 units. Previous studies have shown no antimicrobial activity for 3-DG, however, for the first time it has been shown that when incubated with faecal bacteria 3-DG strongly depressed this microbial community. The influence of dicarbonyl compounds on the anaerobic fermentation processes was confirmed by the reduced production of short-chain fatty acids. Considering the modern Western diet, characterised by high consumption of ultra-processed foods rich in dicarbonyl compounds, this could lead to a reduction of bacteria important for the microbiome.

Tackling food insecurity in Cabo Verde Islands: the nutritional, agricultural and environmental values of the legume species.		Foods					Legume species are important food sources to reduce hunger and deal with malnutrition; they also play a crucial role in sustainable agriculture in the tropical dry islands of Cabo Verde. To improve the knowledge of the heritage of plant genetic resources in this Middle Income Country, this study had three main goals: (i) to provide a checklist of food legumes; (ii) to investigate which species are traded in local markets and, based on field surveys, to compare species for their chemical, phenolic, antioxidant, and nutritional composition; and (iii) to discuss the agronomic value and contribution to food security in this archipelago. Our results revealed that 15 species are used as food and 5 of them are locally traded (Cajanus cajan, Lablab purpureus, Phaseolus lunatus, Phaseolus vulgaris, and Vigna unguiculata). The role of these species as sources of important minerals, antioxidants, and nutritional components for food security is highlighted, and the native ones (Lablab purpureus and Vigna unguiculata) stand-out as particularly well-adapted to the climate of these islands, which are already experiencing the adverse effects of climate change. We conclude that the sustainable use of these genetic resources can contribute to the reduction of hunger and poverty, thus meeting some challenges of the Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 by the authors.

Familiarity, attitudes and behaviours as key factors to explore plantain and amaranth flours as potential ingredients for sandwich bread.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The objective was to identify the familiarity, attitudes and behaviours of consumers regarding amaranth and plantain-based foods focusing on sandwich bread (SB). A total of 221 responses from Mexican consumers were collected using a questionnaire implemented in Google Forms. Results showed that consumers were more familiar with foods based on amaranth (95%) than plantain (36%). A significant relationship (P<0.05) of gender and familiarity with health implications of SB consumption was found. Women were aware of health implications, whereas men were not. Age had an important relationship with the emotions elicited from the consumption of SB. Younger participants indicated that they feel calm and older participants guilty. Age and gender are potential factors to guide the development of the SB formulation as a viable proposal to diversify products based on plantain and amaranth flours. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Food Control					Damage incurred during the catch process is an indicator of the overall quality of fish and fish welfare. Because catch quality is difficult to improve once it has deteriorated, it is important to preserve quality during the catch process. Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) is the most important species in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. Bottom trawling is a non-benign fishing method, and it is therefore considered important to reduce damage imparted to fish during capture, and subsequently improve catch quality and fish welfare. In the present study, the levels of damage on cod captured with a new gear design were assessed in the Barents Sea bottom trawl fishery. Furthermore, this study investigated to what extent the compulsory sorting grid and diamond mesh codend configuration employed in the fishery is responsible for the damage incurred by cod during the capture process. In total, 750 cod captured over 25 hauls were evaluated for catch damage (marks, ecchymosis, exsanguination, and scale loss). The results showed that substituting the grid and codend configuration with a four-panel selective knotless section followed by a gentle codend increased the probability of cod having no catch damage by 6.00% (CI: 0.6%-11.41%). Moreover, the gentle codend led to a significant reduction in the severity of all catch damage categories.

S.; Hanan Hasan; Nazamid Saari							Production of cationic antifungal peptides from kenaf seed protein as natural bio preservatives to prolong the shelf-life of tomato puree.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					This study determined the favourable fermentation conditions for the production of antifungal peptides from kenaf seeds and their effectiveness in extending the shelf-life of tomato puree. The optimum fermentation conditions for the maximum activity of the antifungal peptides were 8.4% (w/v), 7 days and 3.7% for substrate/water ratio, fermentation time and glucose concentration, respectively. Eight cationic peptides of low molecular weight ranging from 840 to 1876 Da were identified in kenaf seed peptides mixture (KSPM). The minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration of KSPM against Fusarium sp. were 0.18 mg/mL and 0.70 mg/mL, respectively, while those for Aspergillus niger were 1.41 mg/mL and 2.81 mg/mL respectively. KSPM exhibited a fungicidal effect and a prolonged lag phase, with increased fungal membrane permeability as the concentration of KSPM increased, as evidenced by the release of intracellular constituents. The treatment of tomato puree with 1000 mg/kg KSPM delayed fungal growth for up to 14 and 23 days at 25 °C and 4 °C respectively, significantly reducing Aspergillus niger and Fusarium sp. counts. In conclusion, kenaf seed peptides prepared by lacto-fermentation possess antifungal activity, hence can be applied as natural bio preservatives to extend the shelf-life of food products such as tomato puree.

Determination of soluble solid content in market tomatoes using near-infrared spectroscopy.		Food Control					Tomatoes are widely consumed worldwide, and the soluble solid content (SSC) is one of the most important quality parameters for the commercialization of fresh tomatoes, mainly in the salad group. In this regard, partial least square models for intact tomatoes SSC were developed using a portable F-750 Vis-near-infrared (NIR) with Zeiss MMS1-NIR spectrometer in an interactance geometry. Thus, tomatoes from five regions (states of Goias, Bahia, Santa Catarina, Minas Gerais, and Sao Paulo) were collected weekly from November 2018 to November 2019, with a total sample number of 2.085, divided into three populations, two for calibration and one for prediction. The best partial least squares regression prediction model was obtained using the Vis-NIR spectral region of 840-1050 nm with Orthogonal Signal Correction (OSC) pre-treatment applied. The calibration population standard deviation (SD) was 0.52%, and for the prediction population, the SD was 0.56%. Low root mean square error cross-calibration of 0.32%, and root mean square error prediction of 0.32% were achieved. The models were able to discriminate low from high values and vice versa.

Omasal flow of nonstructural carbohydrates and nitrogenous compounds in lactating dairy cows fed diets containing timothy cut in the afternoon or morning.		Journal of Dairy Science					Shifting the cutting of grass from morning to afternoon has been shown to increase the concentration of nonstructural carbohydrates (NSC) in forages. We compared the effects of diets (66:34, forage: concentrate ratio) containing a mix (% of the diet dry matter) of baleages (46.5%) and silages (19.3%) harvested from timothy cut in the afternoon (p.m. -cut TIM diet) or morning (a.m. -cut TIM diet) on omasal flows of NSC and nitrogenous fractions, ruminal and total-tract digestibilities of nutrients, plasma concentration of AA, and milk yield and composition. Eight ruminally cannulated Holstein cows averaging (meanstandard deviation) 31.46.13 kg/d of milk, 13617.0 d in milk, and 61166.4 kg of body weight in the beginning of the experiment were used in a crossover design with 21-d periods (14 d for diet adaptation and 7 d for data and sample collection). Intake of total ethanol-soluble carbohydrates (TESC; +150 g/d), starch (+129 g/d), and total NSC (TESC plus starch = +278 g/d) was greater with feeding the p.m. -than the a.m. -cut TIM diet. Likewise, the apparent ruminal digestibilities of TESC (+149 g/d), starch (+167 g/d), and total NSC (+316 g/d) increased in the p.m. -cut TIM diet. Diets, however, had no effect on the omasal flows and apparent ruminal and total-tract digestibilities of dry matter and organic matter. Intake of N increased in cows fed the p.m. -versus the a.m. -cut TIM diet (562 and 528 g/d, respectively) despite no effect of diets on dry matter intake. Diets did not affect the omasal flows of total nonammonia N, total bacterial nonammonia N, nonammonia and nonbacterial N, and individual AA, and the efficiency of microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. Contrarily, supply of rumen-degradable protein increased (+9.2%) in cows fed the p.m. -cut TIM diet, with this response driven by the 6.4% increase in N intake. Plasma concentrations of essential and nonessential AA followed the omasal flow of AA and were not changed by diets. Feeding the p.m. -versus the a.m. -cut diet significantly increased yields of 4% fat-corrected milk and milk fat, and tended to increase energy-corrected milk, milk true protein, and milk lactose yields. Overall, feeding the p.m. -cut TIM diet to mid-lactation dairy cows did not improve microbial protein synthesis and omasal flow of AA, and these responses were in line with the lack of a treatment effect on dry matter intake.

Food Chemistry					Edible wild plants are part of the ethnobotanical and gastronomic heritage of different geographical areas. Corema album (L.) D. Don is an endemic species of the dune systems of the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. The aerial parts of Corema album are a source of nutrients and antioxidants. The Corema album white berry (Portuguese crowberry) is rich in calcium, iron, and zinc. The plant also shows high phenolic content and antioxidant capacity associated with the leaves, fruit, and flowers. The presence of organic acids, namely phenolic acids, such as hydroxycinnamic acids, and long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) omega-3 and omega-6 has also been confirmed. Toxicity studies evaluated by cell viability tests with human intestinal epithelium model cells (Caco-2) have shown that, at low concentrations, plant extracts may present beneficial effects.

Antimicrobial, antioxidant, volatile and phenolic profiles of cabbage-stalk and pineapple-crown flour revealed by GC-MS and UPLC-MSE.		Food Chemistry					Unconventional parts of vegetables represent a rich source of health-promoting phytochemicals. The phenolic profile of cabbage-stalk flour (CSF), pineapple-crown flour (PCF), and their essential oils were characterized via UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MSE and GC-FID/MS. Antimicrobial activity was tested against five strains, and antioxidant activities were determined in free and bound extracts. Globally, 177 phenolics were tentatively identified in PCF (major p-coumaric acid, ferulic acid, and 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde) and 56 in CSF (major chlorogenic acid, quercetin 3-O-glucuronide, and p-coumaric acid). PCF exhibited a distinguished profile (lignans, stilbenes) and antioxidant capacity, especially in bound extracts (1.3 g GAE. 100 g-1; 0.6 g catechin eq. 100 g-1; DPPH: 244.7; ABTS: 467.8; FRAP: 762.6 g TE. G-1, ORAC: 40.9 mg TE. G-1). The main classes of volatile compounds were fatty acids, their esters, and terpenes in CSF (30) and PCF (41). A comprehensive metabolomic approach revealed CSF and PCF as a promising source of PC, showing great antioxidant and discrete antimicrobial activities. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Enterobacteriaceae, coliform, yeast, and mold contamination patterns in peanuts compared to production, storage, use practices, and knowledge of food safety among growers in Senegal.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Peanuts and peanut products are significant revenue sources for smallholder farmers in the Senegalese peanut basin. However, microbial contamination during production and storage can greatly affect market access for producers. Peanut products have emerged as possible sources of foodborne illness, encouraging discussions on international standards for peanuts. In this study, we interviewed 198 households throughout the Senegalese peanut basin to assess current production practices, storage methods, and producers' prior knowledge of microbial contamination using a 162-question survey. A member of each household orally completed the survey with a trained enumerator and the results were compared to microbiological results obtained from peanut samples collected at the time of the interview using linear regression and an analysis of variance model. Samples were collected from stored peanuts at each household; peanuts were shelled and total Enterobacteriaceae, coliform, and yeast and mold populations were enumerated. Of the 198 samples analyzed, 13.0% and 13.6% were greater than the upper detection limits for Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms, respectively. A total of 21.2% of samples were above the detection limit for yeast and mold populations. Only 22.7% and 18.7% of producers were aware of pathogenic bacteria or aflatoxins, respectively; there were no significant differences in observed microbial populations between household who took preventative measures against microbial contamination and those who did not. Additionally, four households reported washing their kitchen utensils before using them to eat and 60.1% reported always washing their hands before eating. Enumerators were asked to report peanut storage container type and if the containers were stored off the ground at the time of collection. While the interaction between storage container type and if the container was stored off the ground was significant for Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms, it was not significant for yeast and mold. Additionally, when storage container type and if peanuts were stored off the ground were included in the regression model, these methods were predictive of contamination levels for Enterobacteriaceae and coliforms. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the relationship among Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and mold contamination and producer knowledge of Senegalese peanuts. These results provide preliminary data to inform future studies to determine pathogen prevalence and impactful preventative measures to minimize microbial contamination of peanuts produced in Senegal.

J		Britwum, K.; Bernard, J. C.; Albrecht, S. E.							Does importance influence confidence in organic food attributes?		Food Quality and Preference					Previous studies have established that consumers have a significantly higher willingness to pay (WTP) for organic foods over their conventional counterparts. Not fully understood is how consumers view the importance of the required attributes of organic, how confident they are that the organic label reflects these attributes, and how these two factors interact and influence WTP. This study used non-hypothetical auction experiments to examine these issues with a sample of 128 consumers from the general population. Participants first entered their WTP for conventional and organic versions of four different foods selected in different categories (dairy, meat, vegetable) to cover the different possible organic attributes. They were then asked to rate their importance level in, and confidence of, seven required attributes of USDA organic (e.g. no synthetic pesticides, non-GM). The specific goals were to examine the relationship between importance and confidence ratings, and to determine if confidence ratings can be predicted by importance and how confidence in turn influences WTP. For the former, importance ratings for all organic attributes were found to be significantly higher than corresponding confidence ratings. Results from a simultaneous equation system then showed that higher importance ratings significantly increased confidence ratings, while higher confidence increased marginal WTP for all four organic food products. These findings suggest WTP for organic foods is more complex than typically perceived, with it relying heavily on how important consumers see each attribute and their confidence that they are really getting those attributes with their purchases.

Influence of iprovalicarb, mepanipyrim and tetraconazole fungicides on anthocyanins and color the Cabernet Sauvignon red wines.		European Food Research and Technology					The quality of wines from Cabernet Sauvignon grapes spiked with iprovalicarb, mepanipyrim and tetraconazole fungicides was assessed in terms of oenological parameters, color, phenolics, antioxidant properties and fungicide residual levels. Mepanipyrim and tetraconazole contents decreased by more than 93%, and iprovalicarb contents by about 82-90%, during the winemaking process. The content in the monomeric anthocyanin of mepanipyrim treatment decreased 1.2 times, whereas that of its polymeric forms increased 1.3 times. The total content in the monomeric anthocyanin of iprovalicarb treatment increased by about 30%. The most markedly affected anthocyanins were malvidin derivatives, which increased by up to 42%. The wines also had a stronger yellow component. A multivariate statistical analysis was conducted to identify relationships between color variables and the anthocyanin profile. A two-factor model explains 97% of the variance in anthocyanin profiles (X) and 69% in color (Y). ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Broadfoot, R.; Abdi, I. A.							Implications of crystal-size distributions in product massecuites from horizontal and vertical continuous pans.		International Sugar Journal					The crystal-size distribution of product massecuites from continuous pans has always been of major interest to designers of these pans. As several overseas cane factories seek to operate continuous pans with lower pressure vapour, e.g. vapour 3 or vapour 4 from the evaporators, and also to use seed with smaller crystal size in order to increase the extent of crystallisation conducted in continuous pans, a closer examination of the factors affecting the crystal size distributions of product massecuites is warranted. Both these changes tend to produce a broader spread of crystal sizes. This paper examines the influence of the seed crystal-size distribution, the residence time distribution, the number of cells in the continuous pan, and the dispersion of crystal growth rates on the product crystal-size distribution. The size distributions of both horizontal and vertical continuous pans are considered, as well as the implications for the future applications of both types of continuous pans. Measures to narrow the size distribution of the product crystals are examined.

J		Broadfoot, R.; Abdi, I. A.; Lowrey, M.; Mitchell, G.							Performance of the SRI fixed-element cooling crystatliser at Broadwater Mill.		International Sugar Journal					The fixed-element design of horizontal cooling crystalliser is relatively new to the Australian industry and installation Broadwater Mill for the 2017 season proved to be an economical solution to refurbish the mill's first unit in a station of three crystallisers. The crystalliser consists of 12 fixed cooling elements and 14 rotating paddles. A variable-speed drive was installed to allow a rotational speed of the paddles up r/min, depending on the massecuite viscosity and imposed torque. Apart from fabrication of the fixed elements, the mill's staff undertook the complete installation. During the 2019 season, trials were undertaken to determine the heat-transfer performance and massecuite-exhaustion performance for different conditions inlet massecuite composition, rotational speed of the paddles and cooling rate. The residence-time distribution for massecuite flow through the crystalliser was also measured. The results this test program are reported and recommendations provided for maximising the exhaustion performance. The installation costs this type of refurbishment and the financial implications Australian factories are discussed.

Prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella serovars isolated from U.S. retail ground pork.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					One objective of this study was to determine overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from U.S. retail stores over three seasons including both case-ready and store-ground packages. Package types collected included: overwrap, chub, modified atmosphere packaging, and other (plastic or wax paper wrapped). Because package type represents different production systems and are subject to varied microbiological government regulation and testing methodologies, both USDA-FSIS and FDA Salmonella isolation protocols were performed. Another objective of the study was to determine serotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of the isolates obtained from the ground pork samples. Ground pork aliquots were subjected to real-time PCR. Recovered isolates were serotyped and minimum inhibitory concentration analysis to 15 antimicrobials was determined using microbroth dilution. Overall prevalence of Salmonella in ground pork from the 865 samples collected was 1.39%. Prevalence was not affected by package type (p= 0.29) nor grind location (case-ready vs. store-ground; p= 0.17). Season affected Salmonella prevalence (p= 0.05) with most isolates found during fall, and there was a tendency for geographic region to affect prevalence (p= 0.07). The USDA Salmonella isolation method was more effective at recovering isolates (p= 0.01) compared with the FDA methodology and yielded a kappa statistic of 0.26 as a measure of agreement. The serotypes isolated included: Infantis, 4,5,12:i:-, Brandenburg, Typhimurium var 5-, Seftenberg, and Johannesburg with only two packages containing multiple serotypes. No isolates were resistant to antibiotics commonly used to treat human Salmonella infections including extended spectrum cephalosporins or fluoroquinolones. Although the recovery of Salmonella from retail ground pork samples was rare, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium (and its monophasic variant 4,5,12:i:-), which are among the most common serovars recovered from human infections, were recovered. Therefore, more effective strategies to further reduce or eliminate these pathogens from retail pork products are warranted.

J		Broeck, G. van den; Mardulier, M.; Maertens, M.							All that is gold does not glitter: income and nutrition in Tanzania.		Food Policy					A substantial acceleration in improving nutrition is required to eradicate malnutrition by 2030. Income growth and increased labor productivity are key to realize this, but some income sources and employment sectors might be more effective in reducing malnutrition than others. We investigate the link between income and nutrition in rural Tanzania, using two rounds of the Tanzania National Panel Survey. We use both monetary and non-monetary measures of food consumption, and analyze besides caloric intake also the intake of important micronutrients, such as iron, zinc and vitamin A, and nutrient deficiencies. We compare income by employment sectors and by gender of the earner. We find that income growth is important for improving household nutrition, both in terms of food quantity and quality. We find that a higher share of income from agricultural self-employment as well as jointly earned income is strongly correlated with caloric and micronutrient intake across households. We do not find evidence to support the assertion that a higher share of income earned solely by women is associated with improved nutrition. Our results imply that closing the labor productivity gap between agriculture and rural non-farm sectors, and raising rural incomes from within agriculture, is a more effective strategy to improve nutrition in rural Tanzania than diversifying income away from agriculture.

J		Broeckhoven, I.; Verbeke, W.; Tur-Cardona, J.; Speelman, S.; Yung Hung							Consumer valuation of carbon labeled protein-enriched burgers in European older adults.		Food Quality and Preference					Considering population aging and the adverse health consequences older adults face due to protein malnutrition, older adults' protein intake is receiving increasing attention. Meanwhile, growing concern around the world's environmental challenges has elucidated the crucial role of dietary choices. This study gives insight into more sustainable ways of increasing older adults' (≥65) protein intake in the European Union (EU) to prevent protein malnutrition. A choice experiment (n=2159) was conducted in five EU countries (the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Poland, Finland, and Spain). Multinomial choice modeling shows that the majority of older adults accept protein-enriched burgers. Overall they prefer red meat and poultry above plant-based burgers. For red meat and poultry burgers, older adults prefer products with carbon labels indicating lower environmental impact. Latent class modeling identified four consumer segments. The largest segment (41%), "Meatlovers", are not likely to change their red meat and poultry consumption. However, carbon labeling entails some opportunity. "Eco-friendly" consumers (28%) are willing to consume protein from more sustainable sources and herewith constitute the primary target group. "Poultry lovers" (12%) are most likely to shift their protein consumption based on health-related motives. Further research is recommended to identify sustainable protein-rich products for older adults who dislike burgers (19%). Subsequent consumer profiling indicates that intentions to consume sustainable protein-enriched burgers are associated with gender, country, importance attached to health, sustainability and familiarity, knowledge on protein and their environmental impact. In contrast, financial situation, importance attached to price, convenience, and sensory appeal are not associated with older adults' preferences. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Characterization of protein in cricket (Acheta domesticus), locust (Locusta migratoria), and silk worm pupae (Bombyx mori) insect powders.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Nutritional and functional properties of protein were determined for cricket, locust, and silk worm pupae powders, specifically macro-nutrient proximate composition, full amino acid composition, protein pH-solubility, and SDS-PAGE/densitometry. Cricket and locust powders contained >70 g of crude protein/100 g of sample powder (d.b. -dry basis), while silk worm pupae powder >50 g of crude protein/100 g of sample powder (d.b.). Insect powders exceeded FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for eight of the nine essential amino acids (EAAs) for adults, but not infants. Total EAAs (21.8-23.7 g EAAs/100 g sample; d.b.) was two-times higher than FAO/WHO/UNU recommendations for adults (12.7 g EAAs/100 g sample; d.b.), but only half for infants (46.0 g/100 g; d.b.). Nearly 70% of insect protein dissolved in alkaline pH, while only 7% at pH 4-6. SDS-PAGE/densitometry showed four protein fractions: cuticle proteins, actin-arginine kinase, hemocyanin, and myosin. SDS-PAGE/densitometry also showed proteolysis and various distribution of protein fractions among insect powders. Protein may be efficiently isolated from insects using pH-solubility-precipitation; thus, resulting in isolates with high nutritional and functional quality.

J		Broge, E. H. de L.; Wendin, K.; Rasmussen, M. A.; Bredie, W. L. P.							Changes in perception and liking for everyday food odors among older adults.		Food Quality and Preference					The age-related decline in olfactory function is well established and concerns intensity perception and odor identification. However, the extent to which olfactory decline influences food preferences is less clear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether there are decline patterns relating to food odors, specifically. This study investigated intensity perception and hedonic liking for 14 multi-component food odors and one pure odorant in three groups of older adults (age 60-69, age 70-70, age 80+) and a group of young adults. In total 335 subjects were tested, 246 old and very old adults and 89 young adults. The age group 60-69 was on par with the young adults, whereas intensity perception declined for the majority of odors for older adults age 70-79 and the very old age 80+. The largest drop in intensity perception was seen for savory odors; fried meat, mushroom and onion. In contrast, intensity perception for raspberry and orange did not differ between groups of older adults and young adults. Hedonic liking decreased to some degree with increasing age but remained largely the same for savory odors (bacon, mushroom, fried meat and onion). A decline in liking was seen for coffee and thyme. This study shows evidence that age-related decline in intensity perception is food odor specific and some aggregation may occur at a higher concept level for the 'savory" category. Furthermore, hedonic liking is not necessarily dependent on the intensity perception as seen for several odors, where declining intensity perception did not impact hedonic liking. This could be explained by changes in dose-response relationships for the group of ageing individuals, which in fact may favor persistence of the food odor liking, despite a decline in their intensity perception.

J		Brooks, C.; Swainson, M.; Beauchamp, I.; Campelos, I.; Ishak, R.; Martindale, W.							Transformational steam infusion processing for resilient and sustainable food manufacturing businesses.		Foods					Here we show how food and beverage manufacturers report more incisive sustainability and product fulfilment outcomes for their business enterprises when innovative processing technologies are used. The reported steam infusion technology heats food materials within a Vaction Pump device so that steam is directed into the food material within a much reduced volume, reducing the use of steam and processing time. This study reports how such technological interventions will enable supply chain stakeholders to demonstrate responsible consumption by connecting assessments for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions with consumer-focused outcomes such as product quality. The technology reported in this research not only improves operational agility by improving processing speed, but also improves the responsiveness of factory production to changes in demand. Heating procedures are systemic processes in the food industry that can be used to pasteurize, achieve commercially viable shelf-life, and provide cleaning in place. The reported research defines how these technologies can reduce the carbon footprint of products, improve quality attributes, and lower operating costs across supply chains. They provide an important step in developing distributed manufacturing in the food system because the technologies reported here are modular and can be installed into existing operations. The specific technology can reduce energy consumption by 17.3% compared to basic direct steam heating, with a reduction of 277.8 processing hours and 8.7 tonnes GHG emissions per kettle production line each year. Food and beverage manufacturers are increasingly required to report across the sustainability, nutrition, and product quality outcomes of their business enterprises more incisively so that supply chain stakeholders can demonstrate responsible production and consumption. The steam infusion technologies assessed in this research enable alignment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG12, Responsible Production and Consumption, using in situ data logging in factory trials for novel heating procedures used to process foods. © 2021 by the authors.

A comparison of colonizing ability between Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Heidelberg in broiler chickens challenged through feed administration.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					With over 1 million estimated cases per year in the United States, foodborne salmonellosis is an important public health issue. Chicken products are frequent sources of foodborne Salmonella infection. These bacteria readily colonize the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens, and feed is a known vector. Past research has demonstrated that the survivability of Salmonella in feed is dependent on the serovar and strain. Therefore, the objective of this research was to compare colonization incidence of these two serovars in broiler chicken tissues by administration of feed contaminated with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (SE) or Salmonella enterica serovar Heidelberg (SH). A comparison was made with equal conditions so that there was no influence of other factors. Birds were inoculated by addition of Salmonella to the feed (1*104 colony-forming unit [CFU] /g of feed) at 14 days of age, and the following tissue samples were collected from each bird after grow-out (days 34-41 depending on the trial): abdominal cavity swab, bone marrow swab, cloaca swab, lung swab, breast, bursa and thymus, ceca, crop, kidney, liver and spleen, skin, spinal cord, thigh, and trachea. A higher percentage of birds inoculated with SE were positive in at least one tissue compared with SH (68% and 9%, respectively), and the SE inoculated birds also showed a higher number of positive tissue samples than SH (13.1% and 0.7%, respectively). Recovery of SH was low for all tissue samples. However, recovery of SE was variable between samples, with ceca showing the highest percentage (50%). These results indicate that challenge at day 14 through feed administration results in greater colonization by SE compared with SH, suggesting that monitoring and control methods for Salmonella in feed should focus on SE to have the greatest positive effect.

Astringency sub-qualities of red wines and the influence of wine-saliva aggregates.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Astringency is a sensory attribute, related to the quality and mouthfeel of red wines. However, the origin of astringency sub-qualities, such as the typical drying astringency found in immature grapes, is still unknown. Astringency of red wines with similar tannin content but different astringency sub-qualities, from different harvest dates, is studied. Astringency was characterised in terms of friction coefficient, polyphenol content, sensory analysis and tannin/salivary-proteins aggregates characterisation. A different evolution during ripening was found for both Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenere, and tannin-protein aggregates showed differences in size, shape and surface. The velvety sub-quality appears to be related to aggregates with low precipitation, and with specific surface characteristics as roundness and Feret diameter. Results from this work propose an effect of aggregates on sensory perception and opens the possibility to explore their effect on oral lubrication. © 2021 The Authors.

Foods					Implicit ("unconscious") approach-avoidance tendencies towards stimuli can be measured using the Approach Avoidance Task (AAT). We recently expanded a toolbox for analyzing the raw data of a novel, mobile version of the AAT (mAAT), that asks participants to move their phone towards their face (pull) or away (push) in response to images presented on the phone. We here tested the mAAT reaction time and the mAAT distance in a study with 71 Dutch participants that were recruited online and performed an experiment without coming to the laboratory. The participants used both the mAAT and (explicit) rating scales to respond to photographic images of food. As hypothesized, the rated wanting, rated valence and mAAT reaction time indicated a preference for palatable over unpalatable food, and for Dutch over Asian food. Additionally, as expected, arousal was rated higher for unpalatable than for palatable food, and higher for Dutch than for Asian food. The mAAT distance indicated that the unpalatable food images were moved across larger distances, regardless of the movement direction (pull or push), compared to the palatable food images; and the Dutch food images were moved across larger distances than the Asian food images. We conclude that the mAAT can be used to implicitly probe approach-avoidance motivation for complex images in the food domain. The new measure of mAAT distance may be used as an implicit measure of arousal. The ratings and the mAAT measures do not reflect the exact same information and may complement each other. Implicit measures, such as mAAT variables, are particularly valuable when response biases that can occur when using explicit ratings are expected. © 2021 by the authors.

Pre-storage application of 1-methylcyclopropene does not affect the flavour of "Conference" pears ripened after 8 months of commercial-standard controlled atmosphere storage.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Postharvest 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) applications are commercially used on "Conference" pears to obtain an improved fruit quality after storage for up to 11 months. Treatment with 1-MCP may result in firmer and greener fruit at the end of storage. During subsequent shelf life, 1-MCP treated pears may show slower ripening, including a reduced rate of softening and a reduced production of aroma volatiles. The lower levels of aroma volatiles and consumer complaints of reduced flavour suggest that flavour is negatively affected by 1-MCP treatments, which has raised concern within in the Dutch fruit industry. In the present study, the effect of pre-storage 1-MCP treatment on post-storage ripening and flavour perception was studied. Untreated and 1-MCP-treated pears (325 nL L-1) were stored for 8 months at-0.8 °C under controlled atmosphere conditions of 3 kPa O2 and 0.6 kPa CO2 according to commercially used protocols. At day 7 and 9 of the subsequent shelf life at 10 °C, 1-MCP-treated fruit showed decreased yellowing and ethylene production, whereas firmness was similar to that of untreated fruit. The production of aroma volatiles was significantly reduced in 1-MCP-treated fruit; this was especially observed for different acetate esters, ethanol and butanol. Despite the reduction in aroma volatiles, a consumer panel could not distinguish (in a Tetrad test) between samples from untreated and 1-MCP-treated fruit with similar firmness. This indicates that the important aroma volatiles, although reduced in abundance, were still above threshold levels and did not affect overall flavour perception. We conclude that 1-MCP does not affect flavour when pears within equal firmness classes are compared. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Restaurant date-marking practices concerning ready-to-eat food requiring time and temperature control for safety.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Certain foods are more vulnerable to foodborne pathogen growth and formation of toxins than others. Lack of time and temperature control for these foods can result in the growth of pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, and lead to foodborne outbreaks. The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Food Code classifies these foods as time/temperature control for safety (TCS) foods and details safe cooking, holding, and storing temperatures for these foods. The FDA Food Code also includes a date-marking provision for ready-to-eat TCS foods that are held for >24h. The provision states that these foods should not be held in refrigeration for >7 days and should be marked with the date or day by which the food should be "consumed on the premises, sold, or discarded." To learn more about restaurants' date-marking practices, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Environmental Health Specialists Network (EHS-Net) conducted observations and manager interviews in 359 restaurants in 8 EHS-Net jurisdictions. Managers reported that they date marked ready-to-eat TCS foods more often than data collectors observed this practice (91% vs. 77%). Observation data showed almost a quarter of study restaurants did not date-mark ready-to-eat TCS foods. In addition, restaurants with an internal date-marking policy date marked 1.25 times more often than restaurants without such a policy and chain restaurants date marked 5.02 times more often than independently owned restaurants. These findings suggest that regulators and the retail food industry may improve food safety and lower the burden of foodborne illness in the United States if they target interventions to independent restaurants and encourage strong date-marking policies.

Subjective and objective colour, purge loss, and colour stability were measured over 4 days of retail display. Forequarter muscles from all dark cutting carcasses were not different from those of normal Canada AA carcasses, suggesting that forequarter muscles may be preferentially harvested for sale through normal retail outlets. None of the adductor, biceps femoris, gluteus medius, and semitendinosus muscles in the AT carcasses were dark and all had retail display colour stability comparable to that of normal steaks, indicating that these muscles in these carcasses are undervalued. Sorting of dark cutting carcasses by longissimus thoracis pH or a* and b* values will allow for value to be recovered from atypical dark cutting carcasses. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bruce, R. C.; Lestringant, P.; Brenneman, C. A.; Heymann, H.; Oberholster, A.							The impact of optical berry sorting on red wine composition and sensory properties.		Foods					The impact of optical berry sorting was investigated using Grenache, Barbera, and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Yolo County, California in 2016. Optical sorting parameters were adjusted to remove underripe berries and material other than grapes using color parameters. Wines were made from three treatments, control (no sorting), sort (accepted material), and reject (material rejected by the optical sorter). The rate of rejection was approximately 14.9%, 3.9%, and 1.5% (w/w) for Grenache, Barbera, and Cabernet Sauvignon, respectively. Chemical composition in the finished wines was analyzed by the Adams-Harbertson assay and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for phenolics, and head-space solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry for aroma profiling. In general, optical sorting was successful in removing underripe berries and material other than grapes as evidenced by lower ethanol levels and higher concentrations of total phenolics and tannin (due to the inclusion of material other than grapes) in wine made from rejected material. Despite this, no difference in final ethanol content and minimal differences in phenolic composition were observed between control and sort treatment wines for the three varieties studied. Differences were observed in the aroma profiles of the reject treatments for all three varieties compared to sort and control; however, few compounds differed significantly between the sort and control treatments. Descriptive sensory analysis revealed that panelists had difficulty distinguishing aroma, taste, mouthfeel, and color parameters among wines made from different treatments for all three varieties. Thus, optical sorting had minimal impact on wine sensory properties using the varieties and vineyards studied. Optical sorting may be used to differentiate and sort for different ripeness levels using color as a primary criterion; however, the impact on the resulting wine is likely dependent on the initial variability in grape ripeness. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bruehl, L.; Unbehend, G.							Precise color communication by determination of the color of vegetable oils and fats in the CIELAB 1976 (L*a*b*) color space.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					The precise determination of the colour of oils and fats is a common and important parameter for the production of oils, fats, margarine, and mayonnaise. A new method has been developed and tested in order to improve reliability and reproducibility of the results. It is based on colour values, which describe the colour in a 3D space as defined by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) as CIE 1976 (L*a*b*). The precision data obtained from a collaborative method validation test show significant improved repeatability with relative coefficients of variation of repeatability between 0.1 and 1.7% except for a very dark pumpkin seed oil (2.7%). The coefficients of variation of reproducibility range from 0.7 to 13.9%. The signals of very intense colored samples might exceed the linear range of some measuring instruments. Solutions of colour standards tartrazine and Ponceau 4R as pure (>99%) and non-toxic substances are tested for laboratory calibration covering a colour space from CIE 1976 L* (63-99), a* (-23-67), and b* (0.5-119). A storage experiment with these standard substances is carried out and the results show improved stability over a period of 80 days compared to bromothymol blue and iodine standard solutions. Practical Applications. The results of this study show the suitability of an analysis method for the determination of the colour of oils and fats using the 3D CIE 1976 colour space as an alternative to the common Lovibond system of red and yellow colour values. As the international harmonized approach of the CIE 1976 colour space is widely accepted for the communication of precise colour description and differences between two different colors in many applications all over the world, this will be also an advantage for the communication and specification of colors in the oils and fats industry, market, and trade. In addition, the use of easy to prepare colour standard solutions enables every laboratory to check the suitability of their colour measuring device in a convenient way. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	7			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000329					FSTA:2021-11-Ne2539

Physicochemical characterization of honeys from Brazilian monitored beehives.		European Food Research and Technology					This study was performed with floral honeys from an innovator and pioneer project in Brazil for the digital monitoring of beehives. Samples from six regions of the Santa Catarina state were evaluated for moisture, acidity, pH, electrical conductivity, 5-HMF, diastase activity, fructose, glucose, sucrose, and minerals (K, Ca, Na, Mg, and Mn). Furthermore, chemometric analyzes were applied to classify honeys based on these parameters. Some results did not corroborate with the current legislation for free acidity (≤50 mEq kg-1) and electrical conductivity (≤0.8 mS cm-1). In all samples, the minerals K (0.37*103 to 3.03*103 mg kg-1) and Ca (0.03*103 to 0.38*103 mg kg-1) were majority. Considering that the results were different (p<0.05) for all floral honey samples, cluster and principal components analysis (PCA) were performed to group samples by similarity. Cluster analysis provided a first separation of the honeys and PCA highlighted the K, Ca, Mg, and Na as the best contributors for honeys discrimination. In this regard, the physicochemical parameters, sugar, and mineral content were important to elucidate the characteristics of honeys. They indicated that the beehives handling and the hygienic-sanitary conditions during the collection and transport of samples were also adequate. Furthermore, mineral elements were proposed to discriminate honey samples produced in different regions of Santa Catarina state, Brazil. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Brugnini, G.; Rodriguez, S.; Rodriguez, J.; Rufo, C.							Effect of UV-C irradiation and lactic acid application on the inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria in vacuum-packaged beef.		Foods					The objective of this study was to test the effect of the combined application of lactic acid (0-5%) (LA) and UV-C light (0-330 mJ/cm2) to reduce Listeria monocytogenes and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on beef without major meat color (L *, a *, b *) change and its impact over time. A two-factor central composite design with five central points and response surface methodology (RSM) were used to optimize LA concentration and UV-C dose using 21 meat pieces (10 g) inoculated with L. monocytogenes (LM100A1). The optimal conditions were analyzed over 8 weeks. A quadratic model was obtained that predicted the L. monocytogenes log reduction in vacuum-packed beef treated with LA and UV-C. The maximum log reduction for L. monocytogenes (1.550.41 log CFU/g) and LAB (1.551.15 log CFU/g) with minimal impact on meat color was achieved with 2.6% LA and 330 mJ/cm2 UV-C. These conditions impaired L. monocytogenes growth and delayed LAB growth by 2 weeks in vacuum-packed meat samples throughout 8 weeks at 4 °C. This strategy might contribute to improving the safety and shelf life of vacuum-packed beef with a low impact on meat color. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Brunchi, C. E.; Morariu, S.; Bercea, M.							Impact of ethanol addition on the behaviour of xanthan gum in aqueous media.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effect of ethanol (EtOH) addition on the behaviour of xanthan gum (XG) chains in water (W) was investigated at 25°C by using turbidimetry, zeta potential, refractometry and viscometry. The presence of EtOH (nonsolvent) in aqueous solution of XG reduces the thermodynamic quality of solvent and increases the polymer-polymer contacts (i.e., electrostatic, H-bonding or hydrophobic interactions). Thus, the transition from an expanded chain conformation to a more compact one was evidenced by viscometry, zeta potential masurements and refractometry while the aggregation of macromolecules or phase separation were observed by turbidimetry. A phase diagram for XG in solvent/nonsolvent mixtures was provided. For volumetric fractions of ethanol (PhiEtOH) higher than 0.3, zeta potential increases above-30 mV and the aggregation of xanthan chains takes place. Measurements of refractive indices were used to determine the preferential adsorption coefficient (lambda1) for different volumetric fractions of ethanol. The parameter lambda1 quantifies the polymer chain affinity for one component of the solvent/nonsolvent mixtures. The polyelectrolyte effect of XG chains in solution and the variable polarity as a function of W/EtOH composition influence the overall thermodynamic behaviour of XG assessed through the viscometric parameters determined by using the Wolf approach.

Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and chemometrics for organic cinnamon evaluation.		Food Chemistry					Organic food consumption has increased significantly over time. This contributes to the increased demand and price of this kind of food. Among the organic products, cinnamon stands out for its characteristic flavor and bioactive compounds. Thus, the work aimed to verify the potentials of attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FT-MIR) coupled with Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) for evaluation of cinnamon organic samples. As result, the proposal is feasible in the differentiation of organic cinnamon powder, in which ATR-FT-MIR coupled with PARAFAC showed the differentiation of organic from non-organic ones on the scores mode, the precision at repeatability level on one loading mode, and the spectral region, on the other loading mode, above 2600 cm-1 was related to the differentiation of the organic and non-organic samples.

J		Bruno, A. de; Romeo, R.; Gattuso, A.; Piscopo, A.; Poiana, M.							Functionalization of a vegan mayonnaise with high value ingredient derived from the agro-industrial sector.		Foods					This work aimed to evaluate the antioxidant effect determined by the addition of phenolic extract on the oxidative stability and quality of vegan mayonnaise. Two different antioxidant extracts containing 100mg L-1 of hydroxytyrosol and obtained by olive mill wastewater were used in the preparation. After preliminary studies, already evaluated in other works, on hydrophilic and lipophilic food matrices, the results of this study could contribute to understanding the effects of the enrichment on emulsified food systems with phenolic extracts. The functionalized mayonnaise samples were monitored up to 45 days of storage at 10°C in comparison with a control sample for microbiological, physicochemical, antioxidant, sensory properties and for oxidative stability. The results achieved through this work showed the efficacy of the use of phenolic extract as ingredients for its positive effect on chemical properties of mayonnaise. The adding extracts lead to the increase of oxidative stability with an induction period higher (about 24 h) than the control sample (about 12 h). © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bruno, A. de; Romeo, R.; Piscopo, A.; Poiana, M.							Antioxidant quantification in different portions obtained during olive oil extraction process in an olive oil press mill.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Different antioxidant compounds are generally transferred from olives to olive oil during the production process. This work characterized the principal total bioactive compounds (tocopherols and phenols) in olives, olive oil and by-products of four cultivars grown in Calabrian areas (southern Italy), considering the effect of harvesting period. Antioxidant capacity, total and individual phenolic compounds were also analysed. Results. Drupes, olive paste, pomace and olive wastewater showed similar phenolic compounds, while olive oil possessed a different composition, suggesting that phenols are not only transferred from drupe to oil, but also they change during oil production. Tocopherols varied among cultivars and harvesting period: generally, they were more abundant in samples produced in the first harvesting period. Qualitative and quantitative differences in phenolic composition and antioxidant activity were significantly found among cultivars in all the matrices. Conclusion. The highest amount of total phenolic antioxidants ended up in olive wastewater with variability due to the olive cultivar, while only a small part of them finished in the oil. This work shows evidence that the availability of bioactive compounds in different portions from the olive oil extraction belong to different varietal origins. In particular, new information was acquired on Ottobratica Calipa, a new olive clone, that produced an olive oil with an interesting antioxidant amount. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	3	1119	1126	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10722					FSTA:2021-05-Ne1046

Influence of different dispersing systems on rheological and microstructural properties of citrus fiber suspensions.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The propensity of edible fiber to structure aqueous suspensions can be tuned also by modifying the process adopted to disperse it in water. In this paper a rotor-stator homogenizer and a high pressure microfluidizer are used to produce fiber aqueous suspensions with increasing fiber content, investigating the effects of process conditions on rheological properties and particles-size distribution of these materials. An isoenergy criterion was chosen to vary the power supplied by the rotor-stator device to suspensions, and, on the other hand, two operating pressures were used to produce a second set of suspensions via microfluidization. The obtained results highlighted the greater propensity of microfluidizer to disrupt particles, stabilizing the final system by varying mainly the network extension. Finally, a fractal model was adopted to predict the rheological behavior of suspensions as a function of fiber content. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Kudre; Bhaskar Narayan							Optimisation of ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction conditions of umami compounds from fish by-products using the combination of fractional factorial design and central composite design.		Food Chemistry					In this work, ultrasound-assisted enzymatic extraction (UAEE) conditions of umami compounds from Labeo rohita head (LRH) was optimised using the combination of fractional factorial design (FFD) and central composite design (CCD). Six factors that can potentially influence the degree of hydrolysis (DH), equivalent umami concentration (EUC), and extraction yield (EY) of umami extract were screened through FFD. The three most significant variables were further optimised using the CCD. The developed models were successfully fitted to the experimental data and used to determine optimal extraction conditions. The optimum DH (22.73%), EUC (6.61 g MSG/100 g protein), and EY (76.34%) of umami extract were achieved with a liquid-solid ratio of 3 (v/w), ultrasonication time of 19.20 min and hydrolysis time of 140.45 min. Besides, UAEE umami extract exhibited higher DH, EUC, EY, and umami taste compared to that of the conventional enzymatic extraction (CEE).

Core dimensions of food-related lifestyle: a new instrument for measuring food involvement, innovativeness and responsibility.		Food Quality and Preference					Segmentation is crucial for targeting product development initiatives and marketing communication nationally as well as internationally. In this paper we use the Food Related Lifestyle instrument that has been applied in the food arena for many years as a "stepping stone" to develop a contemporary, targeted and smaller version of the Food Related Lifestyle instrument, still following the original theoretical framework. In particular we focus on three dimensions that have proven to be of core value in segmentation: food involvement; food innovativeness; and, food responsibility. Based on data collection in six countries (DK, AU, HU, UK, USA and NZ) across two rounds from 2017 to 2019 (total N = 3396), we propose a new core instrument consisting of 15 items that have been tested for cross-cultural validity. Next, we used these three dimensions for segmentation across the six countries by applying multi-level latent class analysis. A solution leading to five different segments could be identified; the foodies, the moderates, the adventurous, the uninvolved and the conservatives. The segments were profiled by means of Schwartz's ten value domains and measures of self-reported food-related behaviour to check for nomonological validity. We conclude that the 15 items were cross-culturally valid, could be used for segmentation across six countries, and that segment profiling by means of Schwartz values and behavioural items were in line with the theoretical background.

Journal of AOAC International					Background. In this international Multi-Laboratory Trial (MLT) the precision data and the accuracy of the ISO/CD 22184 IDF/WD 244 analytical method for the quantification of 6 different mono-and disaccharides (galactose, glucose, fructose, sucrose, lactose, and maltose) in milk and milk products with high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) are established. Objective. Thirteen different laboratories participated (located in New Zealand, the United States, and Europe). The study was divided into two parts. First, the learning/familiarization part in which the participants got experienced with the method. After successfully completing this part, the participants were allowed to continue with the second part of this trial: the analyses of the seven blind MLT duplicate samples. Method. The selected seven MLT samples comprise five MUVA reference dairy samples, one NIST-certified infant formula and one industrial sample. In the Tables S-1 to S-6 the results of this MLT study have been summarized per sugar. There is a very good agreement between the MUVA and NIST-certified sugar contents in the MLT samples and in the MLT established sugar contents in those MUVA and NIST samples. Results. This demonstrates that the accuracy of the newly developed HPAEC-PAD method is very good. Conclusions. Certificates of analysis were available for both the MUVA samples and the NIST sample. There is a very good agreement between the by MUVA-and NIS-certified sugar contents in the MLT samples and the corresponding in the MLT established sugar contents. This demonstrates that the accuracy of the HPAEC-PAD method is very good. In the IDF/ISO Analytical Week in June 2019 in Prague the report on the MLT study were discussed and adopted. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

Preferential growth stimulation of probiotic bacteria by galactan exopolysaccharide from Weissella confusa KR780676.		Food Research International					Many microbial exopolysaccharides (EPS) are reported to have prebiotic properties. This study reports the prebiotic properties of a galactan exopolysaccharide produced by Weissella confusa KR780676 of fermented food origin. We have reported potential techno-functional properties of this EPS earlier. We have studied the parameters such as enzymatic hydrolysis, growth proliferation effect on probiotic bacteria and in vitro fecal fermentation to demonstrate the prebiotic property of the galactan. The galactan showed strong resistance to simulated human digestive juices such as alpha-amylase (99.1%), gastric (98.4%) and intestinal fluid hydrolysis (98.8%). It also encouraged the growth of probiotic bacteria viz, Lactobacillus plantarum MTCC9510 (recently reclassified as Lactiplantibacillus plantarum) and L. fermentum MTCC903 (recently reclassified as Limosilactobacillus fermentum) from 6.69 to 9.45 log CFU/mL and 7.13 to 9.05 log CFU/mL respectively in 72 h of fermentation. Carbohydrate utilization also exhibited the same pattern. Fecal fermentation of galactan for 48 h through in vitro studies exhibited significant changes in microbial population and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production. Bifidobacterium sp. and Lactobacillus sp. showed significantly (p ≤ 0.05) higher growth when compared to Enterococcus sp. (9.62 log CFU/mL, 8.45 log CFU/mL and 8.31 log CFU/mL respectively from 6.54 log CFU/mL) at the end of fermentation. SCFAs (acetic acid, butyric acid and propionic acid production) increased significantly (p ≤ 0.05) from 4.53 to 69.12 mM/L, 1.27 to 5.47 mM/L and 0.68 to 42.11 mM/L respectively. These results clearly prove the potential prebiotic property of the galactan EPS and could be used as an effective prebiotic to positively modulate the gut microbiome homeostasis.

J		Bruntha Devi, P.; Suresh Rajendran							Impact of starter culture on nutraceutical and functional properties of underutilized millet-legume co-fermented Indian traditional product.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The influence of starter culture on finger millet-horse gram (cereal-legume) co-fermented Indian indigenous food product (dosa) on antioxidant and nutraceutical properties was investigated. Microbial consortium (Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecalisandSaccharomyces cerevisiae) was used as starter inoculum. Controlled fermentation (8 h, 5% inoculum) enhanced the total phenolic content 1.5-fold which certainly associated with antioxidant activities. Significant (p < 0.05) increase in reducing power and free radical scavenging activities were observed in fermented batter and its corresponding product (dosa) compared to unfermented one. Caffeic acid, quercetin, gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, and syringic acid were detected as key phenolic acids in the product. Solubility of antioxidant compounds increased after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion for the dosa and attained good sensory score. Amino acid profile revealed 1.06-fold increase in the total essential amino acid and 21% rise in lysine content during controlled fermentation. Other essential amino acids viz. Methionine, cysteine, histidine, isoleucine, valine, leucine and tryptophan also increased notably. Significant (p < 0.05) increase in extractable rate of minerals, protein and starch digestibility and decrease in phytate content were observed during fermentation. Thus, the controlled fermented product with significant nutrient content and antioxidant properties, and high acceptability would be used as a nutraceutical product.

Quantitative risk assessment of listeriosis associated with fermented sausage and dry-cured pork shoulder consumption in Argentina.		Food Control					The risk of acquiring listeriosis from consuming fermented sausages and dry-cured pork shoulder (capicola/bondiola) in Argentina was estimated using quantitative microbiological risk assessment. The model included data about initial prevalence and contamination level of Listeria monocytogenes, product formulation with or without a starter culture (lactic acid bacteria [LAB]), time and temperature during distribution and storage prior to consumption, and consumption patterns. The probability of listeriosis from fermented sausage consumption in at-risk populations was estimated with average values of <10-11 per portion consumed. The main factor associated with such probability was the use of LAB in fermented sausage production, which reduced the risk by at least three orders of magnitude. Meat mass pH during fermentation and water activity (aw) at the end of ripening were the factors having the greatest impact on the probability of listeriosis. Thus, LAB added during production, pH values < 5.1 at the end of fermentation and aw<0.93 during ripening indicated that the environment was not appropriate for L. monocytogenes development, suggesting that fermented sausages had an adequate safety level. On the other hand, the risk of listeriosis from dry-cured pork shoulder consumption was negligible, even in the most susceptible populations. Both aw level and the strict control of process temperature were the main risk factors for acquiring listeriosis. The level of protection given by the current Argentine microbiological criterion for fermented sausages and dry-cured pork shoulder (absence of L. monocytogenes in 25 g of product) would guarantee the safety of these products similarly to the <100 cfu/g cut used in other countries.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Rice bran oil is unique among edible oils owing to its rich source of commercially and nutritionally important phytochemicals, such as oryzanol. gamma-Oryzanol performs an important role in the stability of rice bran oil. The crude rice bran oil obtained by solvent extraction is subjected to either chemical or physical refining to meet the specifications of edible-grade vegetable oil. These refining processes can cause the compounds present in rice bran oil to degrade. The aim of this study was to evaluate the stability of gamma-oryzanol present in chemically and physically refined rice bran oils, when submitted to temperatures of 100, 140, and 180 °C for a period of 1368h. Results. The chemically refined rice bran oil presented a lower gamma-oryzanol content than the physically refined rice bran oil at all heating temperatures. The losses of gamma-oryzanol at 100 °C, 140 °C, and 180 °C at the end of the heating periods for the chemically refined oil were 53.47%, 58.48%, and 97.05% respectively, and for the physically refined oil the losses were 38.11%, 53.58%, and 91.11% respectively. Conclusion. Based on the results of the time to reduce the oryzanol concentration by 50% and 100%, it is observed that the oil of rice meal refined physically presents greater stability, in the different temperatures studied and over time, than the oil of rice meal refined chemically. Thus, for situations where the oil needs to be subjected to prolonged heating, a temperature of 100 °C is indicated. In this condition, the physically refined oil is better for maintaining a higher concentration of gamma-oryzanol. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Impact of dietary propionate on fructose-induced changes in lipid metabolism, gut microbiota and short-chain fatty acids in mice.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Propionate has antimicrobial activity and is suggested to influence lipid metabolism. Here, we investigated the effect of propionate on lipid metabolism and the gut microbiome in fructose-fed mice as a model of diet-induced steatosis and gut dysbiosis. Therefore, 48 male wild-type mice were fed isoenergetic diets with either 0% fructose (F-) or 40% fructose (F+) that contained 0% propionate (P-) or 1% propionate (P+) for 7weeks. Mice that received the F+diets developed fatty livers, had fewer small intestinal proteobacteria and colonic actinobacteria and were characterised by changes in bacterial genera (e.g., Allobaculum, Lachnospiraceae, and Escherichia). Interestingly, mice fed the F+diets had higher levels of propionate and butyrate in the circulation than mice fed the F-diets (p<0.05). Treatment with propionate influenced neither hepatic or plasma lipids nor levels of circulating SCFAs.

Inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 by pulsed UV light on goat meat and beef: microbial responses and modelling.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The objective of this study was to investigate the efficacy of pulsed UV light (PUVL) in inactivating Escherichia coli K12 on goat meat and beef surfaces. Inactivation studies were conducted for 5 to 60 s at three distances from the light source (4.47, 8.28 and 12.09 cm) in the PUVL chamber. Predictive models using regression and artificial neural networks (ANN) were developed to quantify log reductions. Pulsed UV light was more effective on beef than goat meat. Maximum log reductions of 1.66 and 1.74 CFU mL-1 rinse solution were achieved on goat meat and beef, respectively, at 4.47 cm distance for 60 s. Escherichia coli K12 reduction increased significantly with increasing treatment time and closer distance from the light source. In general, both ANN and regression models effectively described inactivation of E. coli K12. Predictive models describing PUVL inactivation kinetics of E. coli K12 can be used for process optimisation in meat industry. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Rapid monitoring of fungicide fenhexamid residues in selected berries and wine grapes by square-wave voltammetry at carbon-based electrodes.		Food Chemistry					A completely new electroanalytical method for the determination of fenhexamid (FNX) residues in fruit samples has been developed. This method is based on anodic oxidation of fungicide in Britton-Robinson buffer (pH 4) containing 10% (v/v) methanol using square-wave voltammetry when five different carbon-based electrodes were tested. An electrochemical behaviour of FNX was studied on a glassy carbon electrode using cyclic voltammetry, while glassy carbon paste electrode was selected for analytical purposes. Linear range for FNX from 3.96 to 49.50 mol L-1 characterized by coefficient of determination of 0.9964, sensitivity of 0.176 A L mol-1, and detection limit of 1.32 mol L-1 were calculated. Results. Acquired from analyses of blueberries and wine grapes were compared to those obtained by a reference chromatographic method, and a satisfactory agreement has been reached. Finally, it seems that the present voltammetric approach could find its application in food quality control as screening assay.

Food Control					Ochratoxin A (OTA)-secondary metabolite of fungi from genera Aspergillus and Penicillium may mainly contaminate cereal-based food. Thermal processing (including baking) may reduce the levels of OTA, but may also produce racemic mixtures with the 2′R-ochratoxin A (2′R-OTA) isomer. In this study, the stability of OTA during rye bread production processes and pizza wheat base production processes (including dough kneading, dough fermentation, and baking) was investigated. The bread was prepared using a rye flour naturally contaminated with OTA (concentration 6.410.52 mug/kg) and yeast. The bread was baked for 40 min at 180 °C, or for 70 min at 240 °C. The pizza bases were prepared by using wheat flour artificially contaminated with OTA (concentration 8.0 or 18.0 mug/kg). The bases were baked for 8 min at 320 °C or for 6 min at 370 °C. No statistically significant changes in OTA concentration were found after the dough kneading and fermentation production process stages. OTA concentrations in the crumb of the baked breads and pizza bases were also similar to the concentrations in the fermented dough. However, OTA concentrations in the crust decreased as compared to the fermented dough by 25.6% for the bread baked at 180 °C, 23% for the bread baked at 240 °C, and 8.0%-25.4% for the pizza bases, depending on the OTA concentration in the dough and the baking temperature (lower concentrations were associated with higher temperatures). Partial degradation of OTA in the crust of the baked products was accompanied by slight OTA racemization. Approximately 3.5% of the OTA in the crust of the rye bread baked at 240 °C was transformed into 2′R-OTA, increasing its level to 0.18 mug/kg. Briefly, 2.2%-10.1% of the OTA in the crust of the pizza bases was transformed into 2′R-OTA, increasing its levels to 0.13-1.57 mug/kg, depending on the baking temperature (higher concentrations were associated with higher temperature). It is worth noting that so far, apart from a few studies on transformation of OTA during roasting of coffee beans, these mechanisms during baking of cereal-based products are practically unknown.

J		Bryla, M.; Ksieniewicz-Wozniak, E.; Michalowska, D.; Waskiewicz, A.; Yoshinari, T.; Gwiazdowski, R.							Transformation of selected trichothecenes during the wheat malting production.		Toxins					The transformation of deoxynivalenol (DON), nivalenol (NIV), and their glucosides (DON3G and NIV3G) during the malting of grains of two wheat varieties was studied. The concentration of DON3G and NIV3G started to increase significantly before the concentration of DON and NIV increased. This may reflect the transformation of the parent mycotoxin forms into their glucosides due to xenobiotic detoxification reactions. After a sharp rise during the last 2 days of the process (day 6 and 7), the DON concentration reached 3010338 g/kg in the Legenda wheat-based malt and 4678963 g/kg in the Pokusa wheat-based malt. The NIV concentration, at 69165 g/kg, remained the same as that in the dry grain. The concentration of DON3G in the Legenda and Pokusa wheat-based malt was five and three times higher, respectively, than that in the steeped grain. The concentration of NIV3G in the Legenda wheat-based malt was more than twice as high as that in the steeped grain. The sharp increase in the concentration of DON at the end of the malting process reflected the high pathogen activity. We set aside some samples to study a batch that was left undisturbed without turning and aeration, for the entire period of malting. The concentration of DON in the malt produced from the latter batch was 135% and 337% higher, for Legenda and Pokusa, respectively, than that in the malt produced from the batch that was turned and aerated. The NIV concentration was 22% higher in the latter batch. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Brzezinska, J.; Szewczyk, A.; Brzezicha, J.; Prokopowicz, M.; Grembecka, M.							Evaluation of physicochemical properties of beetroot-based dietary supplements.		Foods					In the European Union, no specific requirements for the physicochemical parameters of dietary supplements have been established, contrary to the United States of America. This research aimed to assess the selected physical parameters of 31 commercially available beetroot-based dietary supplements in the form of tablets and capsules following the United States Pharmacopoeia (USP) guidelines and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations. There was also estimated zinc and iron content by atomic absorption spectroscopy with flame detection. Results showed that nine products did not meet the USP requirements. Seven supplements needed more than 30 min to disintegrate. Two products in the form of tablets did not pass the friability test because of cracking. The hardness values varied significantly between manufacturers, demonstrating values from 59.1 to 455.8 N. The iron-enriched supplements differed significantly in iron content compared with the manufacturers' declaration (84.91-140.69%). Inappropriate quality of dietary supplements, which may constitute a potential risk to consumers, can be related to the lack of specific regulations in Europe; hence, similar to the USA requirements should be considered in the European Union. The work emphasizes the need to better control the quality of dietary supplements before they are introduced to the European market. © 2021 by the authors.

Genomic prediction of milk-production traits and somatic cell score using single-step genomic best linear unbiased predictor with random regression test-day model in Thai dairy cattle.		Journal of Dairy Science					Cow genotypes are expected to improve the accuracy of genomic estimated breeding values (GEBV) for young bulls in relatively small populations such as Thai Holstein-Friesian crossbred dairy cattle in Thailand. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of cow genotypes on the predictive ability and individual accuracies of GEBV for young dairy bulls in Thailand. Test-day data included milk yield (n = 170,666), milk component traits (fat yield, protein yield, total solids yield, fat percentage, protein percentage, and total solids percentage; n = 160,526), and somatic cell score (n = 82,378) from 23,201, 82,378, and 13,737 (for milk yield, milk component traits, and SCS, respectively) cows calving between 1993 and 2017, respectively. Pedigree information included 51,128; 48,834; and 32,743 animals for milk yield, milk component traits, and somatic cell score, respectively. Additionally, 876, 868, and 632 pedigreed animals (for milk yield, milk component traits, and SCS, respectively) were genotyped (152 bulls and 724 cows), respectively, using Illumina Bovine SNP50 BeadChip. We cut off the data in the last 6 yr, and the validation animals were defined as genotyped bulls with no daughters in the truncated set. We calculated GEBV using a single-step random regression test-day model (SS-RR-TDM), in comparison with estimated breed value (EBV) based on the pedigree-based model used as the official method in Thailand (RR-TDM). Individual accuracies of GEBV were obtained by inverting the coefficient matrix of the mixed model equations, whereas validation accuracies were measured by the Pearson correlation between deregressed EBV from the full data set and (G)EBV predicted with the reduced data set. When only bull genotypes were used, on average, SS-RR-TDM increased individual accuracies by 0.22 and validation accuracies by 0.07, compared with RR-TDM. With cow genotypes, the additional increase was 0.02 for individual accuracies and 0.06 for validation accuracies. The inflation of GEBV tended to be reduced using cow genotypes. Genomic evaluation by SS-RR-TDM is feasible to select young bulls for the longitudinal traits in Thai dairy cattle, and the accuracy of selection is expected to be increased with more genotypes. Genomic selection using the SS-RR-TDM should be implemented in the routine genetic evaluation of the Thai dairy cattle population. The genetic evaluation should consider including genotypes of both sires and cows. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Buchilina, A.; Kayanush Aryana							Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of camel milk yogurt as influenced by monk fruit sweetener.		Journal of Dairy Science					Camel milk, similar to cow milk, contains all of the essential nutrients as well as potentially health-beneficial compounds with anticarcinogenic, antihypertensive, and antioxidant properties. Camel milk has been used for the treatment of allergies to cow milk, diabetes, and autism. Camel milk helps decrease cholesterol levels in blood and improves metabolism. One of the most desirable food tastes is sweetness. However, the excessive ingestion of sugar negatively affects human health. Monk fruit sweetener is a natural, 0-calorie sweetener with many health-beneficial functions. Monk fruit sweetener helps decrease symptoms of asthma and diabetes, prevents oxidation and cancer, protects the liver, regulates immune function, and lowers glucose levels. Monk fruit sweetener is 100 to 250 times sweeter than sucrose. The objective of this study was to examine the influence of different concentrations of monk fruit sweetener on the physicochemical properties and microbiological counts of drinking yogurt made from camel milk. Camel milk drinking yogurt was produced with 0, 0.42, 1.27, and 2.54 g/L of monk fruit sweetener and stored for 42 d. The physicochemical characteristics and microbiological counts of yogurts were measured at d 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42. For the physicochemical characteristics, pH, titratable acidity, viscosity, and color [lightness-darkness (L*), red-green axis (a*), yellow-blue axis (b*), chroma (C*), and hue angle (h*)] values were evaluated. The counts of Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, coliforms, and yeast and mold were determined. Three replications were conducted. The sweetener addition significantly influenced pH, viscosity, and color (a*, b*, C*, and h*) values. Control samples had significantly higher pH values, lower viscosity, lower b* and C* values, and higher h* values than the samples with 1.27 and 2.54 g/L of monk fruit sweetener. Growth of S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus, and probiotic culture L. acidophilus was not affected by the incorporation of monk fruit sweetener. Monk fruit sweetener can be added in camel milk yogurts as a health-beneficial 0-calorie sweetener. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Post mortem changes in M. iliotibialis lateralis muscle protein profile of emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae).		Meat Science					The available literature lacks information on the metabolic processes taking place in emu muscles after the cessation of circulation. Hence, this study was undertaken to examine the physicochemical characteristics (pH, drip loss, WHC, TBARS, L*, a*, b*) with concomitant changes in protein expression patterns (SDS-PAGE) of femoral muscle (M. Iliotibialis lateralis) that occur post mortem and during the first days (0 h, 24 h, 48 h) of its maturation in 1- and 3-year-old emus. Our results indicated that the interaction between emus age and storage time had significant impact on meat pH and all color indicators. Furthermore, we detected 24 differentially expressed protein bands, representing 22 different gene products. ClueGO pathways analysis revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway, pyruvate metabolism and pyrophosphate hydrolysis-driven proton transmembrane transporter activity. Based on the results obtained it can be assumed that early post-mortem metabolism of emu muscle is predominantly based on the glycolysis as reflected by the relative abundance alterations of the glycogenolytic and glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, the energy supplies provided by ATP and other high-energy substances degradation is higher in the group of older emus. Our findings also highlighted the complexity of the molecular mechanisms underlying the conversion of muscle to meat. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Penicillin and tetracycline residues in selected fresh and UHT milk with different fat contents.		International Food Research Journal					The aim of the present work was to determine the residues of penicillin and tetracycline in selected fresh and UHT milk with different fat contents (< 2, 2, and > 2%). A total of 84 different milk samples (36 fresh and 48 UHT) purchased from retail chains in Silesia Region (Poland) were analysed. Penicillin and tetracycline residues were determined by the ELISA immunoenzymatic method. The obtained results were compared with MRL values adopted in Commission Regulation (EU) No. 37/2010. The results were additionally analysed statistically. Penicillin and tetracycline were found to be common in the analysed milk samples. Both antibiotics were present in low concentrations, and not exceeding their MRL. The median of penicillin residues was 0.298 g/L, and 0.970 g/L for tetracycline. For some samples, the determined levels of antibiotic residues did not exceed the limit of detection (LOD): three samples for penicillin (1.15%), and 24 samples for tetracycline (28.57%). A weak negative correlation between the level of penicillin and tetracycline residues was found (p = -0.218), where the decrease in penicillin concentration weakly correlated to the increase in tetracycline concentration. The level of residues of both antibiotics was significantly higher in fresh milk than in UHT milk (by 11.75% for penicillin, and 17.73% for tetracycline); for penicillin, Zcorrected = 2.445, and p = 0.0145, and for tetracycline, Zcorrected = 3.914, and p = 0.000091.

J		Budhathoki, M.; Zolner, A.; Nielsen, T.; Reinbach, H. C.							The role of production method information on sensory perception of smoked salmon-a mixed-method study from Denmark.		Food Quality and Preference					Product information is capable of steering the consumers' expectation formation process. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate whether information on production method influence consumers' preference and liking of smoked salmon. A consumer test was conducted among 92 consumers to determine liking of the smoked salmon on a 7-point hedonic scale before (blind) and after (informed) receiving information about production method (organic, conventional and wild-caught). Further, two explanatory focus group discussions (n = 5 in each group) were conducted to determine consumers' belief on production method. A linear mixed-effects model analysis indicated that the consumer overall liking of wild-caught smoked salmon significantly increased after production method information was provided, while regarding organic and conventional smoked salmon no significant difference was noted. Post hoc test indicated that organic smoked salmon was significantly more liked than wild-caught smoked salmon (mean difference standard error: 0.652 0.19, p < 0.01) in blind condition, however, between organic and conventional smoked salmon no significant difference was noted (-0.032 0.19, p = 0.983). Further, in informed condition, organic smoked salmon was significantly more liked than conventional smoked salmon (0.50 0.19, p < 0.05), however, between organic and wild-caught smoked salmon no significant difference was noted (0.228 0.19, p = 0.452). Relative importance analysis results suggest that liking of taste was the most important contributor (26.84%) to smoked salmon overall liking (p < 0.05, R2 = 74.17%). Focus group discussion revealed that consumer beliefs related to food safety, animal welfare and sustainability as well as purchasing habits seem to influence smoked salmon preferences. Thus, organic aquaculture sector should focus on promoting consumer beliefs by providing reliable information based on scientific evidences that helps differentiates their products with that of conventional and wild-caught smoked salmon. Future studies might investigate other fish species to better understand the role of product method information on consumer preference and liking of fish. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Food Research Journal					Nowadays, food safety has become an increasingly important aspect to be considered, particularly in developing countries such as Indonesia. Yogyakarta is known for its plethora of street foods, which are sold in public places and school environments. In the present work, the microbiological safety of such street foods, particularly skewered meatballs, was assessed. The present work aimed to detect enteropathogenic bacterial contaminations, particularly enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC), using a combination of microbiological, biochemical assay API 20E, and molecular characterisation of virulence factor by ipaH primer pairs. The results confirmed the presence of bacterial contamination particularly from the most-common coliform group. The street food vendors must be educated by presenting information that the total bacterial count has exceeded the safety threshold. The microbiological examination confirmed the presence of suspected enteropathogenic colonies, based on the biochemical assays. Molecular identification of three isolates yielded positive results containing ipaH gene, which is a strong indication of EIEC-type of bacteria, most probably E. coli and Shigella spp.										2021	28	2	337	341	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-10-Sa5932

Elucidation of volatiles, anthocyanins, antioxidant and sensory properties of cv. caner pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) juices produced from three juice extraction methods.		Foods					This study deals with the characterization of the phytochemical profiles and antioxidant activities of cv. Caner pomegranate (Punica granatum) juices obtained from three different juice extraction methods including halved pomegranate (HPJ), arils (AJ), and macerated arils (MAJ) extraction for the first time. It was found that the type of the juice extraction process had substantial effects on the volatiles, anthocyanin compositions, and antioxidant activities of the samples. Results. Showed that the AJ sample (593 mg L-1) had more anthocyanin compounds followed by HPJ (555 mg L-1) and MAJ (408 mg L-1) samples. GC-MS analysis revealed a total of 34 volatile compounds. The highest number of volatiles was found in the MAJ sample (1872 g L-1); thus, the aril maceration process played an important role in increasing the volatiles as compared to the HPJ (751.8 g L-1) and AJ (710.7 g L-1) samples. Sensory analysis showed that the HPJ sample was the most preferred and its general impression was higher as compared to the AJ and MAJ samples. The findings of this study elucidated that the juice extraction technique had a significant influence on the phytochemical profiles, sensory quality, and antioxidant activity of pomegranate juices. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bue Young Imm; Ye Won Heo; Jee-Young Imm							Effects of plant-based content, flavor and texture information on consumer satisfaction with non-fried ramen.		Food Quality and Preference					The purpose of this study was to screen flavor information for positioning of non-fried ramen products and to examine the applicability of plant-based ingredient content in flavor communication. Effects of information related to savoriness, spiciness, menu name, plant-based ingredient content (%), and texture of samples on informed satisfaction were examined using home-use tests and online surveys. In order to form a regression model that explained variations in the informed satisfaction of non-fried ramen samples, we created indices that integrated the importance of information and the congruence of information with flavor perception. We have confirmed that effects of congruence on increasing satisfaction were higher than those of importance of information. When congruence/importance was used as an independent variable, a quadratic regression equation has explained the variations on satisfaction levels with an R2 value of 72.7% (p = 0.006). Considering the positive congruence effect that plant-based ingredient percentages and perceived flavors had on informed satisfaction levels, communication schemes are needed to promote foods that have high percentages of plant-based ingredients.

Application of classification models in screening superior rice grain quality in male sterile and pollen parents.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Rice breeders often produce high-yielding hybrids targeting the needs of the farmers which often leave behind cooking and eating quality (CEQ) due to lack of high-throughput phenotyping tools. To satisfy the needs of both ends, a quick classification tool was developed for identifying high-yielding hybrids with good CEQ classes through random forest, artificial neural network and support vector machine models with accuracies of 63.9 %, 69.4 % and 69.4 %, respectively. All models were created using routine grain quality parameters, pasting, texture, and starch structure properties. Among these properties, it was found out that gelatinization temperature, breakdown viscosity and pasting viscosity are the most important parameters in classification. The model was validated and found to be applicable for seeds planted in different years and it is most suitable for predicting the similar CEQ ideotypes matching male sterile and pollen parents. It was further used to identify hybrid lines which match the properties of superior quality variety, to ensure the preferences of rice consumers. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Objectives of this study were to: (1) produce coffee kombucha (CK) with Lactobacillus rhamnosus (LG) and Lactobacillus casei (LC) and characterize its microbial diversity, (2) evaluate the physicochemical properties and determine viability of CK inoculums under simulated gastric and intestinal conditions during refrigerated storage. Coffee was fermented for 8 days at 23 °C. LG and LC were inoculated into CK (5% v/v) and stored for 15 days at 4 °C. Acetobacteraceae were predominant for the control and Lactobacillaceae for both treatments after 15 days. CK with LG or LC stored for 15 days had 7.44 and 8.77 log CFU/mL, respectively, after exposure to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions. The DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the addition of LG and LC to the CK shifted the proportion of microbial families from Acetobacteraceae to Lactobacillaceae. This study suggests that added Lactobacilli can subsist in CK for 15 days and survived simulated gastrointestinal transit. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Quality and shelf life assessment of a new beverage produced from water kefir grains and red pitaya.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In order to diversify the consumption of red pitaya, the objective of this study was to evaluate the shelf life of two formulations of non-alcoholic beverages fermented by water kefir using red pitaya and apple pulp as substrates. The beverages were stored at 7 °C for 28 days, with analyses every 7 days. The species of yeast and bacteria identified in the highest percentages were Brettanomyces bruxellensis and Liquorilactobacillus satsumensis. After 28 days of storage, the pitaya and the pitaya and apple fermented beverages showed a reduction of 9.15% and 5.25% in pH, an increase of 2.7 and 1.8 times in acidity, a reduction of 6.27% and 5.25% in the total soluble solids content and an increase of 2.5 and 1.9 times in alcohol content, respectively. The addition of apple pulp to the pitaya-fermented beverage enhanced the antioxidant capacity from 2.49 mM Fe+2.100 mL-1 to 3.19 mM Fe+2.100 mL-1 and the reducing capacity from 42.08 mg EAG.100 mL-1 to 62.01 mgEAG.100 mL-1. However, reductions in the bioactive activity of the beverages were observed during the storage time. Both formulations presented satisfactory scores in relation to all the sensory attributes evaluated. Therefore, red pitaya and apple can be used to produce a new functional beverage.

Role of grape-extractable polyphenols in the generation of strecker aldehydes and in the instability of polyfunctional mercaptans during model wine oxidation.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Polyphenolic fractions from Garnacha, Tempranillo, and Moristel grapes were reconstituted to form model wines of identical pH, ethanol, amino acid, metal, and varietal polyfunctional mercaptan (PFM) contents. Models were subjected to a forced oxidation procedure at 35 °C and to an equivalent treatment under strict anoxia. Polyphenolic profiles significantly determined oxygen consumption rates (5.6-13.6 mg L-1 day-1), Strecker aldehyde (SA) accumulation (ratios max/min around 2.5), and levels of PFMs remaining (ratio max/min between 1.93 and 4.53). By contrast, acetaldehyde accumulated in small amounts and homogeneously (11-15 mg L-1). Tempranillo samples, with highest delphinidin and prodelphinidins and smallest catechin, consume O2 faster but accumulate less SA and retain smallest amounts of PFMs under anoxic conditions. Overall, SA accumulation may be related to polyphenols, producing stable quinones. The ability to protect PFMs as disulfides may be negatively related to the increase in tannin activity, while pigmented tannins could be related to 4-methyl-4-mercaptopentanone decrease.

Characterization of relevant biomarkers for the diagnosis of food allergies: an overview of the 2S albumin family.		Foods					2S albumins are relevant and often major allergens from several tree nuts and seeds, affecting mainly children and young people. The present study aims to assess how the structural features of 2S albumins could affect their immunogenic capacity, which is essential to comprehend the role of these proteins in food allergy. For this purpose, twelve 2S albumins were isolated from their respective extracts by chromatographic methods and identified by MALDI-TOF mass-spectrometry. Their molecular and structural characterization was conducted by electrophoretic, spectroscopic and in silico methods, showing that these are small proteins that comprise a wide range of isoelectric points, displaying a general high structure stability to thermal treatment. Despite low amino acid sequence identity, these proteins share structural features, pointing conformational epitopes to explain cross-reactivity between them. Immunoblotting with allergic patients' sera revealed those possible correlations between evolutionarily distant 2S albumins from different sources. The availability of a well-characterized panel of 2S albumins from plant-derived sources allowed establishing correlations between their structural features and their allergenic potential, including their role in cross-reactivity processes. © 2021 by the authors.

Bioactivity of hydrolysates obtained from chicken egg ovalbumin using artichoke (Cynara scolymus L.) proteases.		Foods					The aim of this work was to obtain chicken egg ovalbumin hydrolysates using aspartic proteinases present in extracts from the artichoke flower (Cynara scolymus L.) and evaluate their antioxidant, antimicrobial, and angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity in vitro. Hydrolysis time and molecular weight (<3 kDa) had a significant influence on the hypertensive and antioxidant activity of the hydrolysates. The <3 kDa fraction of the 16 h hydrolysate had an ACE inhibitory activity with an IC50 of 64.06 g peptides/mL. The fraction <3 kDa of ovalbumin hydrolysate at 2 h of hydrolysis showed a DPPH radical scavenging activity of 30.27 M of Trolox equivalents/mg peptides. The fraction <3 kDa of the hydrolysate of 16 h had an ABTS+ caption activity of 4.30 mM of Trolox equivalents/mg peptides. The fraction <3 kDa of the hydrolysate of 2 h had an iron (II) chelating activity of 32.18 g peptides/mL. From the peptide sequences identified in the hydrolysates, we detected four peptides (from the BIOPEP database) that were already in their bioactive form (IAAEVYEHTEGSTTSY, HLFGPPGKKDPV, PIAAEVYEHTEGSTTSY, and YAEERYPIL), and are reported to display antioxidant and ACE inhibitory activity. © 2021 by the authors.

Pectin degradation accounts for apple tissue fragmentation during thermomechanical-mediated puree production.		Food Hydrocolloids					The relationship between fruit and puree's characteristics is still poorly understood. In particular, it is not understood how pectin solubilisation and degradation alter the texture of plant-cell dispersions and how a targeted application of processing conditions can be used to design naturally textured food products. Systematic combinations of thermal and mechanical treatments with three different temperatures (70, 83, 95°C) and grinding speeds (300, 1000, 3000 rpm), applied on one-month (T1) and six-months stored (T6) apples, were used to generate apple purees with contrasted structural and textural characteristics. For T1, serum viscosity increased with increasing temperature (8-104mPa.s) with a marked increase in pectin solubilisation (1-6mg/g serum). Pectin macromolecular size and (arabinose+ galactose)/rhamnose ratio, estimating pectin side chain branching, decreased with temperature. For T6, pectin showed decreased galactose, leading to facilitated cell separation, low serum viscosity (~16 mPa.s) and restricted impact of process conditions on pectin composition and structure. Grinding had limited impact on pectin solubilisation for T1 and T6 but strongly impacted particle size (498-1096mum for T1 or 320-1068mum for T6) and puree's viscosity (871-1475mPa.s for T1 or 853-1453mPa.s for T6). Tissue fragmentation was favoured by temperature increase for T1 and by the maturation of raw apples. Process parameters induced differences in the puree's structure and texture depending on the maturation level of raw apples. The observed changes were linked to pectin degradation and substantial side chain loss.

J		Buergy, A.; Rolland-Sabate, A.; Leca, A.; Renard, C. M. G. C.							Apple puree's texture is independent from fruit firmness.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					How cellular and molecular structure of raw fruits impact puree's texture is still an unresolved question. Texture variations of purees obtained from four apple cultivars of contrasted texture (Braeburn, Gala, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith) and two modalities (mealiness, fruit load) after two contrasted processes were investigated. Although puree's viscosity strongly varied between cultivars (562-1368 mPa s), it did not correlate with apple firmness, except for Granny Smith. This cultivar had the firmest fruits (3.2 N) and the most viscous purees (1368 mPa.s), in accordance with large particles (around 650 mum), high pulp wet mass and serum viscosity. Mealy Braeburn apples showed lower puree's viscosity (562 mPa.s) than their not-mealy homologues (779 mPa.s). This was due to reduced cell adhesion, maybe because of lower (arabinose+ galactose) /rhamnose ratio, leading to smaller particles during processing. Process also impacted puree's viscosity (692-939 mPa s), with more viscous purees obtained with the high temperature-low shear process.

J		Buerman, E. C.; Worobo, R. W.; Padilla-zakour, O. I.							High pressure processing of heat and pressure resistant fungi as affected by pH, water activity, sulfites, and dimethyl dicarbonate in a diluted apple juice concentrate.		Food Control					High pressure processing (HPP) is a popular method of processing juices to retain "fresh" properties. However, heat and pressure resistant fungi, Byssochlamys spp. and Aspergillus spp., can survive processing and cause spoilage. The goal of this study was to evaluate the pressure and time necessary to cause a reduction of heat and pressure resistant spoilage fungi common in juice and determine the effect of water activity (0.94-1.0 aw) and pH (3.5-7.0) on HPP inactivation kinetics. The effect of sulfites and dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) was also assessed as a proof of concept to determine if either aided in fungal inactivation. Refrigerated storage up to 26 weeks after treatment was performed to assess fungal growth. Processing A. pseudoglaucus in pH 3.5 diluted apple juice concentrate (DAJC) at 600 MPa for 15 min at 5 °C was more effective than in pH 4.6, 7.0, or 4.6 with sulfites. Processing A. fischeri at pH 3.5 or 7.0 for 15 min at 600 MPa, 5 °C or at pH 4.6 for 1.5 min at 450 MPa resulted in a 1-log reduction. The addition of DMDC to pH 7.0 DAJC inoculated with A. fischeri and processed at 600 MPa for 15 min resulted in 1-log activation rather than a reduction. The addition of 8 ppm potassium metabisulfite at pH 4.6 had varying effects between species and did not significantly increase the shelf life. Sulfites aided in reducing A. pseudoglaucus but increased the activation of A. fischeri and P. niveus (B. nivea Westling). Processing at 600 MPa for 15 min at 5 °C resulted in the activation of P. niveus at pH 3.5, 4.6 and 7.0 DAJC at 0.94-1.0 aw. Generally, a greater reduction of all fungi tested was observed at 1.0 aw than at 0.94 aw. A 17-26 week storage period could be achieved, but only at refrigeration.

Injection of iodoacetic acid into pre-rigor bovine muscle simulates dark cutting conditions.		Meat Science					The purpose of this study was to develop an in situ model for dark cutting beef. Iodoacetic acid (IAA) was injected at different concentrations (0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 3.75, 5, or 10 mumol/g of muscle) into pre-rigor bovine longissimus thoracis et lumborum (LTL) muscle samples, and pH and color were evaluated over a 48 h period. Injection of IAA blunted muscle pH decline and lowered lightness (L*), redness (a*), and yellowness (b*) values (P ≤ 0.05) in a concentration dependent fashion. In a follow-up study, LTL muscle samples were injected with 5 mumol IAA/g of muscle to test whether IAA maintains its effect over a 336 h post-mortem storage period. In addition to inhibiting pH decline and decreasing color values, IAA increased LTL muscle water holding capacity (WHC) and firmness (P ≤ 0.05) throughout the 336 h post-mortem storage period. Collectively, these data suggest that pre-rigor injection of IAA generates beef with dark cutting-like characteristics.

Wheat-based food form has a greater effect than amylose content on fermentation outcomes and microbial community shifts in an in vitro fermentation model.		Food Hydrocolloids					Starches with high amylose content resist complete digestion in the small intestine with a fraction (resistant starch) entering the large intestine, where it is fermented by the human gut microbiota resulting in perceived beneficial health effects. However, the effects of food form on the large intestinal digestion of products with different amounts of resistant starch are unknown. Here, wheat flours with 32%, 71%, 74% and 84% amylose content were used to prepare bread, tortillas and noodles, and after in vitro treatment simulating small intestinal digestion, were subjected to in vitro fermentation with a pooled human faecal inoculum. The results showed that food form rather than initial amylose content significantly affected both fermentation rates and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. Acetate concentrations were significantly greater in the noodle-based fermentations, whereas propionate concentrations were significantly greater in the tortilla-based fermentations (p < 0.05). Butyrate concentrations were also significantly increased for both the noodle and tortilla-based fermentations when compared to bread (p < 0.05). The microbial communities supported by these different food forms were examined by metagenomic sequencing (MGS) of fermentation samples collected over 48 h. Among the top 20 most abundant species, Enterococcus faecium was significantly increased by bread and tortilla, whereas Ruminococcus spp. And Faecalibacterium prausnitzii were increased for noodles. Although the amount of resistant starch reaching the large intestine is a relevant consideration in pursuit of promoting digestive health, our findings suggest that food form has a major influence on the gut microbiota that is reflected in substantive changes in SCFA profiles.

J		Bui, A. T. H.; Cozzolino, D.; Zisu, B.; Jayani Chandrapala							Influence of fat concentration on the volatile production in model whey protein systems as affected by low frequency ultrasound.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Whey protein systems with varying fat concentrations (WF) of 2, 4, and 6% (w/w) were treated by ultrasound at 20 kHz up to 10 min, which corresponded to energy densities ranging from 9.54 to 190.8 J mL-1, respectively. The volatile compounds produced were extracted by solid phase micro extraction (SPME) and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS). The results showed that hydrocarbons, aldehydes, ketones, esters, and alcohols are the predominant volatiles present within WF mixtures. These volatile compounds primarily derived from lipid oxidation of milk fat or cleavage of fatty acids, while some aldehydes, ethyl acetate, and hexanol derived from both lipid oxidation of milk fat and protein degradation. The fat content had negligible effects on the production of volatile compounds. In contrast, the fatty acids showed insignificant changes within WF systems containing 2% (w/w) fat, while some significant changes were observed with 4% and 6% (w/w) fat containing WF systems. However, the sonication time significantly influenced both the production of volatiles and the changes in fatty acids irrespective of the fat concentration highlighting the influence of both chemical and physical effects generated through acoustic cavitation. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Effect of quality of carnauba wax (Copernica cerifera) on microstructure, textural, and rheological properties of soybean oil-based organogels.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work was designed to elaborate soybean oil organogels structured with three different types (T-I, T-III, and T-IV) of carnauba wax, aiming to find the best wax type and concentration for application in foods. Carnauba wax T-I and T-III produced gels Type 5 (firm and no oil release) at lower concentration (4.5% w/w) in comparison to T-IV (5.0% w/w). Thermal stability of wax T-III at 4% w/w organogel was higher in comparison to T-I and T-IV; however, all waxes at >5.5% w/w formed organogel type 5. Color parameters L*, a*, and b* were directed related to wax type. The polarized light microscopy revealed that organogels formed two different crystal morphologies post-crystallization as a result of Ostwald ripening. Organogels stored for 24 h showed a condensed display of crystals, whereas those stored for 2 months cluster crystalline particles. The hardness of 24 h stored organogels was the same (p< 0.05) for all carnauba waxes (T-I = 0.13 N, T-III = 0.18 N, and T-IV = 0.06 N) whereas counterparts stored for 2 months the hardness values were significantly (p< 0.05) higher (T-I = 0.22 N, T-III = 0.28 N, and T-IV = 0.10 N). Carnauba wax T-III at 4% w/w showed excellent properties for diverse food applications. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Atherosclerosis development and aortic contractility in hypercholesterolemic rabbits supplemented with two different flaxseed varieties.		Foods					Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is widely regarded as the main beneficial component of flax for the prevention of cardiovascular disease. We evaluated the effect of the transgenic flaxseed W86-which is rich in ALA-on the lipid profile, atherosclerosis progression, and vascular reactivity in hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared to the parental cultivar Linola with a very low ALA content. Rabbits were fed a basal diet (control) or a basal diet supplemented with 1% cholesterol, 1% cholesterol and 10% flaxseed W86, or 1% cholesterol and 10% Linola flaxseed. A high-cholesterol diet resulted in an elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels compared to the control animals. Aortic sections from rabbits fed Linola had lower deposits of foamy cells than those from rabbits fed W86. A potassium-induced and phenylephrine-induced contractile response was enhanced by a high-cholesterol diet and not influenced by the W86 or Linola flaxseed. Pretreatment of the aortic rings with nitro-L-arginine methyl ester resulted in a concentration-dependent tendency to increase the reaction amplitude in the control and high-cholesterol diet groups but not the flaxseed groups. Linola flaxseed with a low ALA content more effectively reduced the atherosclerosis progression compared with the W86 flaxseed with a high concentration of stable ALA. Aorta contractility studies suggested that flaxseed ameliorated an increased contractility in hypercholesterolemia but had little or no impact on NO synthesis in the vascular wall. © 2021 by the authors.

Effects of apple pomace as a sucrose substitute on the quality characteristics of compound chocolate and spread.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The purpose of the this study was to determine the effects of dried apple pomace (DAP) as a partial replacer for sucrose on the compound chocolate and chocolate spread formulation. The DAP concentrations changed between 4 and 20 g/100 g. The results indicated that with the increase of DAP in the chocolate samples, particle size, hue angle, and total amount of phenolic substances of samples increased. However, the hardness, color parameters, and overall acceptance decreased. Furthermore, firmness and spreadability of spreads were evaluated between 4.04-5.98 N and 1.92-3.05 N/mm, respectively. Presence of polyphenols and dietary fiber indicated that this by-product could be used as a healthy ingredient in chocolate and spread formulation to partially replace sucrose. However, during the processing of the DAP; the initial particle size of pomace can be further reduced by increasing the grinding speed, time, or number of grinding steps. Practical applications. The application of fruit by-products is increasing rapidly in the preservation of fruits because of being healthy for consumers. Apple pomace is an important by-product to enhance the nutritional quality of compound chocolate and chocolate spreads. The antioxidant potential of apple pomace makes it advantageous for the chocolate and its derivatives without negatively affecting the quality of the final product. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bukke Vani; Chandra Sekhar, S.; Nivedita Sahu; Sundergopal Sridhar							Development of a UV coupled indigenous hydrophilized polyamide membrane system for enhanced shelf life of mature coconut water.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The demand for mature coconut water is growing tremendously in beverage industries due to its high salubrious value and potential healing properties. Many coconut processing industries that manufacture products such as coconut oil, coconut milk, and desiccated coconut generate a massive volume of unutilized mature coconut water. Thus, the discharged liquid waste of valuable food products causes severe environmental pollution. Therefore, there is a need to develop a strategy to treat the unused liquid discharge that can improve shelf-life, natural freshness, flavor, aroma, and recovery of value-added products. In the present investigation, mature coconut water (CW) was concentrated by a UV coupled hydrophilized polyamide (HPA) reverse osmosis (RO) membrane. Experiments were conducted by varying functional parameters like applied pressure and operating time on flux, percentage water recovery, and salt rejection. From experimental observations, the membrane was found to exhibit 62.50% water recovery and 86.35% salt rejection with a maximum water flux of 4.85L/m2. H at an optimized feed pressure of 8 kg/cm2. Further research was carried out by passing the concentrate solution through a UV module at 254nm to prevent bacterial contamination. Additionally, the physicochemical parameters were assessed, and sensory evaluation studies were conducted to explore the final product's properties. The concentrate and permeate CW shelf-life was enhanced from 2h to 30days by refrigerating the samples at 4 °C. Finally, the cost estimation of the designed system is provided to verify process scale-up and commercialization feasibility. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	3			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13636					FSTA:2021-07-Hs6615

Extraction, purification and characterisation of exopolysaccharides produced by newly isolated lactic acid bacteria strains and the examination of their influence on resistant starch formation.		Food Chemistry					Exopolysaccharides (EPS) were produced by four newly isolated lactic acid bacteria strains, then further extracted, separated and characterised under standardised conditions. Using a sucrose carbon source, these LAB strains belonging to Weissella confusa/cibaria produced EPS with a dextran high molecular weight fraction. The obtained yields of EPS ranged from 3.2 g/L to 47.1 g/L and outstandingly high yields were obtained using Weissella confusa/cibaria 3MI3 isolated from spontaneous spelt sourdough. After purification the influence of EPS-dextran of molar mass 3,244,000 g/mol on resistant starch formation in wheat starch pastes and pasted samples after temperature-cycled storage was examined. Size exclusion chromatography with post-column derivatisation revealed that a 1.5% share of EPS dextran limited formation of high molar mass resistant starch in starch pastes during storage. This work provides new insight on hindering resistant starch formation by using EPS, which could be efficiently produced in sourdough, thus improving the properties of sourdough bread.

J		Bulat, T.; Topcu, A.							Influences of oxidation-reduction potential on kefir: microbial counts, organic acids, volatile compounds and sensory properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of oxidation-reduction (redox) potential (Eh) on microbiological and sensory characteristics, volatile compounds, and organic acids of kefir produced using wild or commercial culture were investigated during 21 d of storage. The Eh of the milk was modified using reducing or oxidizing chemical agents. Eh7 (Eh expresses at pH 7) values of control, reduced and oxidized kefirs produced using the wild kefir culture were -195.5, -206.1 and + 178.3 mV, while control, reduced and oxidized kefirs produced using the commercial kefir culture had Eh7 values of -199.6, -208.1 and + 180.7 mV, respectively, on 1 d of storage. Generally, the viability of microorganisms in the kefirs was adversely affected by oxidized conditions, but it was species-and strain-dependent. The Eh caused the change of metabolic routes of the microorganisms and, thereby, the change of volatile compounds and organic acids contents of kefir. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the volatile compounds separated the kefirs according to the culture and redox status. Kefirs with low Eh were characterized by the presence of sulphur compounds, whereas kefirs with oxidative Eh were characterized mainly by aldehydes and diacetyl. In addition, reduced Eh caused arising in sensory preference of the kefir samples. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Buldo, P.; Sokolowsky, M.; Hoegholm, T.							The role of starter cultures on oral processing properties of different fermented milk products.		Food Hydrocolloids					Oral processing of food is a complex and highly dynamic process as the physical properties of foods change continuously when they are manipulated in the mouth. Texture and mouth feeling are important drivers of liking for fermented milk products and therefore are of high interest in the product development. The textural properties of fermented milk can be manipulated by ingredients, including starter cultures, and production process. The bulk texture of fermented milk products is often not a good indicator of some mouthfeel properties, such as smoothness and mouth coating. Tribology approaches are increasing due to their ability to better describe the mechanical oral processing, when compared to rheological measurements. In the present study, the role of starter cultures, on the lubricating and mouthfeel properties of different types of fermented fresh dairy products was studied, using the examples: stirred and concentrated yoghurt, quark and post-pasteurized ambient yoghurt (PPAY). Oral processing and mouthfeel properties were analyzed with a ball on three pins tribometer and by descriptive sensory analysis, respectively. The complexity revealed by the oral processing properties measured via friction coefficient (FC) indicates a product, hence microstructure, dependency. This was reflected by the five curves shape identified. Independently from the curve shape, the selected FCs negatively correlated to mouth thickness and mouth coatings for all studied products. In the case of fatty, grainy, powdery or slimy products, as for quark and PPAY, negative correlations with the selected FCs were identified. The present study highlights the effect of starter cultures on improving the mouthfeel properties of fermented milk products by using a novel approach as tribology. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Dairy Science					Casein (CN) micelles will coagulate in the stomach after ingestion, which is similar to the cheesemaking process. Although genetic variants of bovine proteins, especially kappa-CN, have been confirmed to influence the coagulation properties of the CN micelle, its influence on milk digestibility has not been revealed yet. This study aimed to investigate how genetic variants, glycosylation degree of kappa-CN, and CN micelle size influence digestion rates during in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. Three milk pools, representing kappa-CN phenotypes of either AA, BB, or AB composition were prepared from milk of individual Danish Holstein cows representing these different genotypes. In vitro digestion of the 3 milk pools, AA, BB, or AB, was investigated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and degree of hydrolysis. The results showed that kappa-CN AA milk had faster digestion rate in the gastric phase compared with BB and AB milks, whereas only small differences were apparent in the intestinal digestion phase. The results further documented that the milk pools representing kappa-CN phenotypes BB and AB had comparable overall glycosylation degrees (50.9% and 50.0%, respectively) and higher than that of the AA milk pool (46.9%). Further, the AA milk pool was associated with larger CN micelles. These differences in CN micelle sizes and glycosylation degrees can be part of underlying explanations for the differential in vitro digestion rates observed between the AA, BB, and AB kappa-CN milk pools.

How does public perception of antibiotic use on dairy farms contribute to self-reported purchasing of organic?		Journal of Food Science					The United States regulates the use of antibiotics in agricultural settings to address the global antibiotic resistance problem. Conventional dairy cows treated with antibiotics are kept in the herd and after the withholding period milk is harvested. On organic farms, the US organic standard on antibiotic use requires sick dairy cows to be treated, but treated cows must be removed from the herd and their milk can never again be sold as certified organic. This study investigated the US public's perceptions of the organic dairy farming, antibiotic use on dairy farms, and whether these perceptions affect consumer's self-reported purchasing behavior for organic. We used a nationally representative phone-based survey of 1000 US adults and characterized participants' self-reported (i) knowledge of the legality of antibiotic use on dairy farms (conventional and organic) and (ii) frequency of purchasing organic instead of conventional dairy products, as well as several demographic and other variables. The results indicated that participants' knowledge about antibiotic use practices in dairy farming have no effect on their self-reported purchasing behavior for organic or conventional dairy products. However, respondents who were familiar with the regulations of antibiotic use on dairy farms were more likely to oppose the US organic standard on antibiotic use in dairy farming and thought that past antibiotic use should not permanently remove a cow's organic status. These findings contribute to understanding of public perceptions that shape the US dairy organic market. Practical Application. Income, employment, health and political values, but not consumers' knowledge about antibiotic use in dairy farming, affect self-reported purchasing behavior for organic dairy products. However, consumers who are familiar with the regulations of antibiotic use on US dairy farms disagree with the US organic standard on antibiotic use mandating loss of organic status for any cattle treated with antibiotics. These findings may be useful to organic markets. © 2021 The Authors. Journal of Food Science published by Wiley Periodicals LLC on behalf of Institute of Food Technologists.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aims of this study were (i) to evaluate the existing analysis capacity for lead and cadmium leached from ceramic articles, (ii) to determine the migration of lead and cadmium from glazed ceramic kitchenware sold on the Turkish market, (iii) to estimate the sampling uncertainty. Traditional ceramic cooking ware and Chinese breakfast hollowware were sampled randomly from different sales points located in Bursa in 2018 (n=96). Ceramic articles were subjected to the migration conditions specified in the legislation, and the amount of lead and cadmium was determined with the inductively coupled plasma and mass spectrometry. It was found that the current analytical method can quantify lower levels of the metals with acceptable method performance parameters. The amount of the metals migrated were far below the current permissible limits set in the legislation. Relative sampling uncertainty was estimated as 66.1% and this result was related to the heterogeneity within a lot. Practical applications. Lead and cadmium are used to coat the ceramic kitchenwares during the glazing process. If ceramic kitchenware are produced under good manufacturing conditions and the glaze is undamaged, the migration of lead and cadmium may be lower than the permissible limits set in the legislation. Migration analysis based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) provides high selectivity, sensitivity, and low analytical limits. Considering inevitable sampling uncertainty, at least four articles should be taken from a lot for migration analysis. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15750					FSTA:2022-04-Cf1048
J		Bulut, S.; Karatzas, K. A. G.							Inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 in phosphate buffer saline and orange juice by high hydrostatic pressure processing combined with freezing.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Synergistic action of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) and freezing on inactivation of Escherichia coli K12 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was investigated by employing response surface methodology. Samples containing E. coli were stored at 4, -24 and -80 °C overnight before they were pressurized. A maximum of 1.83 log reduction of CFU.ml-1 was obtained following a 9-min treatment at 400 MPa and 41 °C in samples stored at 4 °C whereas, 5.63 and 6.83 log reductions were obtained in samples frozen at -24 and -80 °C, respectively. Major disruption of E. coli cells observed by scanning electron microscopy and increased amounts of DNA and RNA measured in pressure treated frozen PBS samples indicated that the main mechanism of inactivation in frozen samples was due to cell rapture. The validity of enhanced microbial inactivation by freezing before HHP for a real food system was tested by using orange juice. Pressurization (250 MPa, 15 min) of frozen (-80 °C) orange juice resulted in 4.88,4.15 and 4.61 log CFU.ml-1 reductions in number of E. coli for the samples having pH 3.2, 4.5 and 5.8, respectively. In the absence of freezing, the same treatment caused only up to 0.42 log reduction in samples having pH 4.5 and 5.8.

Effect of salted-drying on bioactive compounds and microbiological changes during the processing of karasumi-like Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) roe product.		Food Chemistry					The physicochemical, biochemical and microbiological changes of karasumi-like Chinook salmon (Oncorrhynchus tshawytscha) roe were determined during 20 days of salted-drying processing. Colour parameters (L*, a*, and b*), water activity (aw) and the pH value decreased at the end of the processing. Total bacterial and LAB counts (log CFU/g) varied over the processing period. Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid (C16:0) and stearic acid (C18:0), and unsaturated fatty acids such as palmitoleic acid (C16:1), oleic acid (C18:1), and arachidonic acid (C20: 4), were significantly decreased (p < 0.05), but conversely, gamma-linolenic acid (C18:3), and eicosapentaenoic acid (C22:5) were increased (p < 0.05) by salted-drying time. Cholesterol and tocopherol contents were reduced, while the astaxanthin and lutein contents were increased (P < 0.05) during the salted-drying process. Salmon karasumi-like product is a high nutrition product that contains a substantial content of functional compounds. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bungenstock, L.; Abdulmawjood, A.; Reich, F.							Suitability of lactic acid bacteria and deriving antibacterial preparations to enhance shelf-life and consumer safety of emulsion type sausages.		Food Microbiology					Ready-to-eat (RTE) sliced emulsion type sausages are sensitive to recontamination with Listeria (L.) monocytogenes during processing and packaging steps. Since Listeria spp. are able to grow on those products under cold storage conditions, taking steps to reduce the recontamination risk and implementing antibacterial hurdles contribute to consumer safety and increase the product quality. With this study data about the suitability of culture broth, cell-free supernatant (CFS) or concentrated bacteriocin preparations (CFSconc) of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria (LAB) obtained from fermented sausages from Germany as protective culture or antibacterial additive were provided. In different challenge tests, the potential of selected LAB or their preparations were investigated for their potential to reduce growth of L. monocytogenes and/or Brochothrix (B.) thermosphacta on sliced RTE emulsion type sausages under modified atmosphere or vacuum during refrigerated storage for a 21-day period. Applied LAB culture broth and CFS could not reduce the growth of L. monocytogenes or B. thermosphacta. On the other hand, samples treated with CFSconc obtained from Pediococcus spp. strains showed a significant inhibition (p < 0.05) of more than 1.5 log10 of the applied L. monocytogenes strains during the storage period. The growth of B. thermosphacta could not be influenced. Thereby, the need for concentrating preparations was shown to be important to obtain a suitable antibacterial preparation that would contribute to consumer safety and food quality when applied as a protective additive.

Post-harvest quality of fresh akabare chili (Capsicum chinese) as affected by hydrocooling, package modification and storage temperature.		International Journal of Food Properties					Akabare chilli (Capsicum chinese) is a high-value crop in the eastern hills of Nepal. Akabare growers faced the problem of its value decrement during transportation and marketing because of immediate post-harvest losses. This study was targeted for finding cheap post-harvest treatment to extend freshness and shelf life of fresh Akabare by applying post-harvest treatments like hydrocooling, refrigerated temperature storage, and perforation mediated plastic packaging. The chemical qualities (moisture, vitamin C and chlorophyll content) were studied on a regular interval of 4 days along with visual inspection for 20 days. The package modification included unperforated as well as perforated polypropylene bags having 2, 4 and 6 perforations of 2.5 mm diameter. Samples without any treatment remained fresh only for 2 days, while only hydrocooled samples retained moisture, vitamin C and chlorophyll content significantly (p< .05) higher than untreated, in both storage temperatures. None of the samples stored at room temperature retained freshness beyond 4 days. Thus, based on the better retention of moisture and vitamin C content, hydrocooling followed by packaging in polypropylene bag (four perforations) and storage at refrigerated temperature could be considered the best post-harvest treatment and packaging.

Rheological, sensorial and volatile profiles of synbiotic kefirs produced from cow and goat milk containing varied probiotics in combination with fructooligosaccharide.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Bifidobacterium bifidum Bb-11 accompanied with fructooligosaccharide (FOS) were used individually to develop a synbiotic kefir from cow and goat milk. Influence of milk type, as well as the probiotic strain was evaluated on the physicochemical, rheological, sensory, volatile flavor properties and probiotic viabilities of kefirs during 28d of storage. The results of this study highlight, L. acidophilus in combination with FOS had a supportive effect on the content of acetaldehyde, probiotics viability and overall sensory appreciation of samples at the end of storage. Particularly, cow milk kefir produced with Lb. acidophilus was found to be more effective on acetaldehyde formation (17.4 ppm mean value). Furthermore, cow milk favored the sensory properties of kefirs than goat milk. In conclusion, cow milk kefir supplemented with Lb. acidophilus and FOS was more appreciated. With regard to probiotic counts and rheological properties, while goat milk supported the survival of probiotics, cow milk had a positive effect on consistency index of samples. Therefore, these ingredients which could be used to provide synbiotic effect in kefirs could be preferred according to the targeted feature to meet the customer satisfaction by enhancing the aspects of products such as rheology, flavor and probiotic content.

J		Burbano, J. J.; Correa, M. J.							Composition and physicochemical characterization of walnut flour, a by-product of oil extraction.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					The by-product of walnut oil (Juglans regia L.) extraction is a press cake rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and other bioactive compounds. From this cake, walnut flour is obtained by a milling process. The composition and a physicochemical characterization of walnut flour was performed: proximal composition, mineral content, and fatty acid and amino acid profiles were measured. Besides, antioxidant capacity and water and oil holding capacities were determined. Walnut flour has 55% of lipids with an optimum w6/w3 ratio, a good lysine/arginine ratio, and high levels of antioxidants that contribute to its oxidative stability, the estimated shelf life being 16 months. In regards to interaction with other ingredients, walnut flour retained 258 and 70% (w/w) of water and oil, respectively. Therefore, these results show that walnut flour is a good source of micro-and macronutrients, compared to flours commonly used in breadmaking. Also, walnut flour has good technofunctional properties and thus its incorporation could improve the nutritional and technological characteristics of new bakery products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Antioxidants bioaccessibility and Lactobacillus salivarius (CECT 4063) survival following the in vitro digestion of vacuum impregnated apple slices: effect of the drying technique, the addition of trehalose, and high-pressure homogenization.		Foods					To benefit the health of consumers, bioactive compounds must reach an adequate concentration at the end of the digestive process. This involves both an effective release from the food matrix where they are contained and a high resistance to exposure to gastrointestinal conditions. Accordingly, this study evaluates the impact of trehalose addition (10% w/w) and homogenization (100 MPa), together with the structural changes induced in vacuum impregnated apple slices (VI) by air-drying (AD) and freeze-drying (FD), on Lactobacillus salivarius spp. salivarius (CECT 4063) survival and the bioaccessibility of antioxidants during in vitro digestion. Vacuum impregnated apple slices conferred maximum protection to the lactobacillus strain during its passage through the gastrointestinal tract, whereas drying with air reduced the final content of the living cells to values below 10 cfu/g. The bioaccessibility of antioxidants also reached the highest values in the VI samples, in which the release of both the total phenols and total flavonoids to the liquid phase increased with in vitro digestion. The addition of trehalose and homogenization at 100 MPa increased the total bioaccessibility of antioxidants in FD and AD apples and the total bioaccessibility of flavonoids in the VI samples. Homogenizing at 100 MPa also increased the survival of L. salivarius during in vitro digestion in FD samples. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Food Analytical Methods					Pressurized water extraction (PWE) is a technique suitable for efficient extraction of almond proteins, some of which are known as potent allergens. In this work, we present a PWE protocol that allows fast and complete isolation of almond proteins achieved within one 5-min cycle at 40°C and 15 MPa. The extracted protein contents obtained using PWE or conventional extraction method with 22 selected solvents were compared based on sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Individual proteins from separation gels were excised and identified using mass spectrometry with database searching. Our results showed that the PWE of almond proteins can offer similar efficiency as the conventional extraction method while being four times faster and providing water-based extracts without any additives with low environmental impact. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The content of carotenoids and tocols in the individual steps of technological processing was determined using HPLC-DAD and HPLC-FLD. The dough preparation resulted in a more pronounced loss of the investigated antioxidants (51.5 and 33.0%) compared to baking (22.5 and 9.1%). Carotenoids appear to be markedly less stable than tocols, as only 26.0% compared to 57.9% of the initial flour content was preserved in the final product, accounting for 0.81 and 29.4 mug/g. In the dough preparation phase, a strong correlation (R = 0.693, p ≤ 0.001) was noted between the tocol content in the flour and the share of retained carotenoids in the dough, indicating a protective effect of tocols on carotenoids. In total, a similar overall retention of carotenoids, as in the leavened bun preparation (27.4%), was found, since the differences in shape of the final product turn out to cause increased carotenoid losses due to high baking temperatures in flatbread.

Comprehensive SPME-GC-MS analysis of VOC profiles obtained following high-temperature heating of pork back fat with varying boar taint intensities.		Foods					Boar taint detection is a major concern for the pork industry. Currently, this taint is mainly detected through a sensory evaluation. However, little is known about the entire volatile organic compounds (VOCs) profile perceived by the assessor. Additionally, many research groups are working on the development of new rapid and reliable detection methods, which include the VOCs sensor-based methods. The latter are susceptible to sensor poisoning by interfering molecules produced during high-temperature heating of fat. Analyzing the VOC profiles obtained by solid phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) after incubation at 150 and 180°C helps in the comprehension of the environment in which boar taint is perceived. Many similarities were observed between these temperatures; both profiles were rich in carboxylic acids and aldehydes. Through a principal component analysis (PCA) and analyses of variance (ANOVAs), differences were highlighted. Aldehydes such as (E, E)-nona-2,4-dienal exhibited higher concentrations at 150°C, while heating at 180°C resulted in significantly higher concentrations in fatty acids, several amide derivatives, and squalene. These differences stress the need for standardized parameters for sensory evaluation. Lastly, skatole and androstenone, the main compounds involved in boar taint, were perceived in the headspace at these temperatures but remained low (below 1 ppm). Higher temperature should be investigated to increase headspace concentrations provided that rigorous analyses of total VOC profiles are performed. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Burgos, V. E.; Armada, M.							Microstructure and storage stability of precooked kiwicha products.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The aims of this research were to evaluate the storage stability of precooked kiwicha products (PK=puffed kiwicha and LK=laminated kiwicha) and to compare them with a commercial puffed amaranth product (CPA); to analyze the microstructure of kiwicha grains and the microstructural changes by processing. The moisture and water activity (WA) increased in all samples during 90-120 days of storage (p< .05). The CPA stored at 120 days had the lowest acceptability due to the highest moisture, WA, peroxides index, and luminosity (L*). The PK stored up to 90 days, had the most acceptability (5.43 1.10), due to the highest crispness and purchase/consumption intention (Z-value=2.63/7.09). The structure of the food matrix of kiwicha grains was modified by processing. This study shows that the precooked products were acceptable and maintained their physicochemical, textural, and sensory characteristics up to 90 days of storage, which can be incorporated as an ingredient in different foods.

J		Burgut, A.							Growth inhibition of foodborne pathogens by co-microencapsulation of lactobacilli cell free and propolis extracts.		Journal of Food Safety					Cell free extracts (CFE) obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum FI 8595 and Lactobacillus reuteri ATCC 55730 alone or in combination with propolis ethanolic or water extracts (1%) were microencapsulated with maltodextrin (25%) before the subsequent spray drying process. They were morphologically characterized by scanning electron microscope. Chemical compositions of pure extracts were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial activities of pure and microencapsulated extracts against four foodborne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC29213, Listeria monocytogenes ATCC19112, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC700603 and Salmonella Paratyphi A NCTC13) were determined using agar well diffusion, broth microdilution and time kill assays. CFE from L. reuteri and L. plantarum consisted of acetic acid, pyrrolo [1,2-a] pyrazine-1,4-dione, hexahydro-3-(phenylmethyl)-, 2,3, 4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde and 9-octadecenoic acid. The results also indicated the presence of two respective major compounds, namely, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol (19.03%) and trans-cinnamic acid (27.67%) in water and ethanolic propolis extracts. Presence of propolis extracts mainly ethanolic extract in microencapsulation led to higher inhibition zones against all foodborne pathogens (p<.05). The co-microencapsulation of CFE from L. reuteri in combination with ethanolic or water extract of propolis resulted in 2.34-and 2.2-fold higher inhibition zone towards L. Monocytogenes. Pure and microencapsulated CFE from L. reuteri resulted in 2.89 and 2.14 logcfu/ml reduction in growth of S. Paratyphi A at 3 hr, respectively. The co-microencapsulation of CFE from lactobacilli and propolis extracts mainly ethanolic extract could be suggested as a novel antimicrobial on inhibition of food pathogens, as they contain abundant bioactive substances. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	41	1			1745-4565				10.1111/jfs.12863					FSTA:2021-06-Lg0923

J		Burke, N.; Zacharski, K.; Adley, C. C.; Southern, M.							A comparison of analytical test methods in dairy processing.		Food Control					Dairy quality strategies start at the beginning of a raw milk supply chain at farm level, but it is the obligation of the manufacturer at a dairy processing plant to ensure quality is upheld from intake to finished product. This is achieved by implementing robust quality systems, measured through sampling plans and analytical test methods. Influences on product quality and composition, and analytical test results within a dairy plant are multi-factorial including: seasonality; the quality of incoming milk and herd health; the level of skilled laboratory technicians; the level of production and the availability of equipment; and finally milk harvesting, transportation and handling. These factors, along with customer and regulatory requirements will determine the level and type of analytical testing required. In the dairy industry, manufacturers oftentimes pay little attention to the need for optimising analytical test strategies or improving laboratory operations, if it is not broken why fix it? The focus of this qualitative research was to differentiate the core current analytical test methods in use at three dairy manufacturing plants for the production of raw milk, skim milk and cream and skim milk powder (SMP). The main objective being to inform and educate each producer on best practice methods. Results displayed similarities across testing categories but demonstrated a range of traditional testing methods in the microbiological analysis compared to advanced instrumentation use in the chemical and compositional analytical category. The dairy industry needs to adapt to a modern, process focused quality system using industry 4.0 analytical processing regimes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Burke, W. J.; Jayne, T. S.							Disparate access to quality land and fertilizers explain Malawi's gender yield gap.		Food Policy					Grain yields on land managed by women in developing countries are usually lower than those on male-managed fields This is usually attributed to unequal access to productive inputs, highlighting the systemically inegalitarian distribution of opportunities between men and women. This study examines the yield differences between male-, female- and jointly-managed maize fields in Malawi. We test the hypothesis that there is no yield gap after controlling for access to higher quality soils, fertilizer, and other inputs. Furthermore, we explicitly test for significant differences in the endowment of soil quality and the likelihood of employing soil improving management practices between male-, female-and jointly-managed fields. We employ field-level data on field managers, production, and input use, coupled with lab-assessed field-specific soil characteristics from 912 observations in Malawi's Central and Southern regions that were collected during the 2018 harvest season. Unlike many previous studies, we measure yield using a combination of yield cuts, plant population density, mid-season chlorophyll measurements, and satellite data (versus using farmer-reported data). Soil quality endowments are measured using total carbon, an effectively fixed condition. Farming effects on soil quality are measured using labile carbon fractions. We find women are disproportionately likely to be farming with lower quality seeds and less fertilizer on lower quality soils, and there is no yield gap after controlling for these factors. Our results will be beneficial to policy makers in Malawi because they highlight potential interventions that can be both productivity-enhancing and advance the goal of gender equality.

Quantitative monitoring of the fermentation process of a barley malt mash by benchtop 1H NMR spectroscopy.		Food Analytical Methods					In order to investigate benchtop NMR spectroscopy as a monitoring tool for fermentation processes, we used a barley malt mash and took various samples over time and analysed them by NMR spectroscopy with 3-(trimethylsilyl)-2,2, 3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid sodium salt (TSP-d4) as an internal standard for the quantification of ethanol and validated the results by two different enzymatic standard test kits for ethanol analysis. We could show that the results between NMR spectroscopy and test kits were consistent with NMR having a much lower standard deviation. Finally, we discussed the applicability of the method as well as the possibility to quantify various other substances. ©The Author(s) 2021.

J		Burnier, P. C.; Spers, E. E.; Barcellos, M. D. de							Role of sustainability attributes and occasion matters in determining consumers' beef choice.		Food Quality and Preference					This study aims to evaluate the influence of socio-environmental attributes on the purchase intention of and the willingness to pay for beef, based on data from Brazilian consumers, using a discrete choice analysis model. Different consumption situations were analysed to check the influence of functional versus recreational/hedonic beef choice. Sixteen (16) hypothetical products were generated in eight (8) scenarios regarding the different socio-environmental attributes of beef. The findings confirm the importance of animal welfare and traceability in the decision-making process for beef purchase. The frequency of consumption, gender, and the presence of a known/familiar brand also influence the beef choice when making a functional (day-to-day) purchase, compared to a recreational/hedonic (barbecue) purchase. The study suggests that the beef industry and retailers should better explore various aspects of greenhouse gas emissions and animal welfare and highlight them in their communication strategies. Investigating the trade-offs between socio-environmental attributes allows a more in-depth evaluation of these attributes and contributes to the literature.

Salmonella enterica colonization and fitness in pre-harvest cantaloupe production.		Food Microbiology					Cantaloupes have emerged as significant vehicles of widespread foodborne illness outbreaks caused by bacterial pathogens, including Salmonella. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficiency of Salmonella colonization and internalization in cantaloupes by relevant routes of contamination. Cantaloupe plants (Cucumis melo "reticulatus") from two cultivars "Athena" (Eastern) and "Primo" (Western) were grown from commercial seed. Plants were maintained in the NCSU BSL-3P phytotron greenhouse. Salmonella enterica (a cocktail of cantaloupe-associated outbreak serovars Javiana, Newport, Panama, Poona and Typhimurium) contamination was introduced via blossoms or soil at ca. 4.4 log10 CFU/blossom or 8.4 log10 CFU/root zone, respectively. Cantaloupes were analyzed for Salmonella by enrichment in accordance with modified FDA-BAM methods. Five randomly chosen colonies from each Salmonella-positive sample were typed using the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer following multiplex PCR. Data were analyzed for prevalence of contamination and serovar predominance in fruit, stems and soil. Of the total cantaloupe fruit harvested from Salmonella-inoculated blossoms (n=63), 89% (56/63) were externally contaminated and 73% (46/63) had Salmonella internalized into the fruit. Serovar Panama was the most commonly isolated from the surface of fruit while S. panama and S. poona were the most prevalent inside the fruit. When soil was inoculated with Salmonella at one day post-transplant, 13% (8/60) of the plants were shown to translocate the organism to the lower stem (ca. 4 cm) by 7 days post-inoculation (dpi). We observed Salmonella persistence in the soil up to 60 dpi with S. Newport being the predominant serovar at 10 and 20 dpi. These data demonstrate that contaminated soil and blossoms can lead to Salmonella internalization into the plant or fruit at a relatively high frequency. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Valorization of hazelnut cake in compound chocolate: the effect of formulation on rheological and physical properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to valorize hazelnut (Corylus avellana L) cake (HC), which is a by-product of hazelnut oil industry, in compound chocolate (HCC) as a partial replacer of sugar and milk originated powders (MOP: skimmed milk and whey powder in equal amounts). D-optimal mixture design was used to optimize HCC formulation. The optimum sugar, MOP, and HC amount were selected as 25.0-40.0,6.0-21.0, and 0.0-15.0 g/100 g, respectively. The Casson model with high R2 values (0.9882-0.9948) was used to determine yield stress and plastic viscosity values of samples which were varied between 1.47 and 2.35 Pa, and 1.17-1.42 Pa s, respectively. Furthermore, particle sizes and water activity were determined between 25.67 and 78.20 mum and 0.31-0.38, respectively. Total phenolic content in HCC samples, their digestibility, and bioaccessibility ranged from 1389 to 3367; 2601-3955 mg GAE/kg, and 112-187% respectively. Also, hardness and brittleness were ranged between 7.85 and 11.55 N and 0.52-1.02 mm, respectively. The sensorial characteristics of the samples along with flow behavior and physico-chemical properties indicated that HC may be used as a healthy and low-cost ingredient in HCC formulation to partially substitute sugar and MOP.

Discriminating dietary responses by combining transcriptomics and metabolomics data in nutrition intervention studies.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Combining different "omics" data types in a single, integrated analysis may better characterize the effects of diet on human health. Methods and results. The performance of two data integration tools, similarity network fusion tool (SNFtool) and Data Integration Analysis for Biomarker discovery using Latent variable approaches for "omics" (DIABLO; MixOmics), in discriminating responses to diet and metabolic phenotypes is investigated by combining transcriptomics and metabolomics datasets from three human intervention studies: a postprandial crossover study testing dairy foods (n=7; study 1), a postprandial challenge study comparing obese and non-obese subjects (n=13; study 2); and an 8-week parallel intervention study that assessed three diets with variable lipid content on fasting parameters (n=39; study 3). In study 1, combining datasets using SNF or DIABLO significantly improve sample classification. For studies 2 and 3, the value of SNF integration depends on the dietary groups being compared, while DIABLO discriminates samples well but does not perform better than transcriptomic data alone. Conclusion. The integration of associated "omics" datasets can help clarify the subtle signals observed in nutritional interventions. The performance of each integration tool is differently influenced by study design, size of the datasets, and sample size. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Burtscher, J.; Etter, D.; Biggel, M.; Schlaepfer, J.; Johler, S.							Further insights into the toxicity of Bacillus cytotoxicus based on toxin gene profiling and vero cell cytotoxicity assays.		Toxins					Bacillus cytotoxicus belongs to the Bacillus cereus group that also comprises the foodborne pathogen Bacillus cereus sensu stricto, Bacillus anthracis causing anthrax, as well as the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis. The first B. cytotoxicus was isolated in the context of a severe food poisoning outbreak leading to fatal cases of diarrheal disease. Subsequent characterization of the outbreak strain led to the conclusion that this Bacillus strain was highly cytotoxic and eventually resulted in the description of a novel species, whose name reflects the observed toxicity: B. cytotoxicus. However, only a few isolates of this species have been characterized with regard to their cytotoxic potential and the role of B. cytotoxicus as a causative agent of food poisoning remains largely unclear. Hence, the aim of this study was to gain further insights into the toxicity of B. cytotoxicus. To this end, 19 isolates were obtained from mashed potato powders and characterized by toxin gene profiling and Vero cell cytotoxicity assays. All isolates harbored the cytK1 (cytotoxin K1) gene and species-specific variants of the nhe (non-hemolytic enterotoxin) gene. The isolates exhibited low or no toxicity towards Vero cells. Thus, this study indicates that the cytotoxic potential of B. cytotoxicus may be potentially lower than initially assumed. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bus, K.; Szterk, A.							Relationship between structure and biological activity of various vitamin K forms.		Foods					Vitamin K is involved many biological processes, such as the regulation of blood coagulation, prevention of vascular calcification, bone metabolism and modulation of cell proliferation. Menaquinones (MK) and phylloquinone vary in biological activity, showing different bioavailability, half-life and transport mechanisms. Vitamin K1 and MK-4 remain present in the plasma for 8-24 h, whereas long-chain menaquinones can be detected up to 96 h after administration. Geometric structure is also an important factor that conditions their properties. Cis-phylloquinone shows nearly no biological activity. An equivalent study for menaquinone is not available. The effective dose to decrease uncarboxylated osteocalcin was six times lower for MK-7 than for MK-4. Similarly, MK-7 affected blood coagulation system at dose three to four times lower than vitamin K1. Both vitamin K1 and MK-7 inhibited the decline in bone mineral density, however benefits for the occurrence of cardiovascular diseases have been observed only for long-chain menaquinones. There are currently no guidelines for the recommended doses and forms of vitamin K in the prevention of osteoporosis, atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular disorders. Due to the presence of isomers with unknown biological properties in some dietary supplements, quality and safety of that products may be questioned. © 2021 by the authors.

Molecular and biochemical differences underlying the efficacy of lovastatin in preventing the onset of superficial scald in a susceptible and resistant Pyrus communis L. cultivar.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The molecular and biochemical events underlying the onset of superficial scald in two pear cultivars with different susceptibility ("Blanquilla" and "Conference") was investigated in fruit untreated and treated with lovastatin, 1-MCP or ethylene. "Conference" pears were characterized by higher content of flavonols and linolenic acid (18:3), two metabolites related to chilling injury resistance. In this cultivar, the expression level of three genes belonging to the ascorbate glutathione pathway (APX, DHAR and MDHAR) were constitutively over-expressed, highlighting the role that endogenous antioxidant potential played in scald control. In the scald-susceptible cultivar ("Blanquilla") the lovastatin treatment, in contrast to 1-MCP, effectively prevented superficial scald development and alpha-farnesene production without affecting fruit ripening. Moreover, lovastatin stimulated an increased production of ethanol and oleic+ cis vaccenic acid (18:1), both compounds being also involved in cold stress tolerance. In both cultivars, and in contrast to 1-MCP, lovastatin did not impair the expression level of the genes devoted to ethylene production (ACO, ACS) and perception (ERS1, ERS2). As a consequence, the expression levels of the genes involved in texture modifications (PG1) and volatile emission (LOX, HPL, ADH and AAT) were maintained in lovastatin-treated samples allowing the fruit to reach an adequate final quality. The results from this study are discussed to highlight the complex regulatory network underlying superficial scald development in different pear cultivars.

J		Buschette, L.; Groom, D.; Neubauer, J.; Spanner, R.; Bolton, M.							A field to factory comprehensive study of microbial flora of sugar beets and factory processing streams.		International Sugar Journal					During the past several campaigns, American Crystal Sugar factories have experienced periods of high unaccountable sucrose losses with consequent lower than expected recovery. Increased unaccountable losses have been highly correlated to increases in lactic acid and acetic acid along with other volatile fatty acids in the diffusion juice. In addition, increased levels of invert sugars and ethanol have been observed in process streams when unaccountable losses are elevated. Elevated sucrose losses tend to occur when cossette ethanol levels increase along with invert sugars. The response to various treatments to manage undesirable microbial activity during the process can vary greatly. Therefore, a comprehensive study was undertaken to identify microorganisms present in the beets, the soil, and the process streams, with the aim to correlate the presence and abundance of bacterial taxa with beet health and processing issues. To date, various classes of microorganisms have been identified in both the beets and process streams that include anaerobic and aerobic mesophiles and thermophiles along with aerobic psychrophiles. In the current study, deep sequencing of 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons with the Minion sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) was used to identify bacteria present in factory samples. Preliminary sequencing experiments have demonstrated a high abundance of Pseudomonas, Serratia and Yersinia spp. across different processing stages and have also revealed the variable presence of lactic-acid producing Carnobacterium, Trichococcus and Aerococcus spp. and thermophilic Thermoanaerobacter brockii, amongst other bacterial taxa. By identifying the microorganisms underlying sucrose losses, it would be possible to tailor processing conditions and prescribe biocides to reduce losses due to microbial activity.										2021	123	1469			0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1805

Single-laboratory validation for the determination of cocoa flavanols and procyanidins (by degree of polymerization DP1-7) in cocoa-based products by hydrophilic interaction chromatography coupled with fluorescence detection: first action 2020.05.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Flavanols and procyanidins are complex bioactives found in many foods such as cocoa. As their consumption is associated with health benefits, cocoa flavanols and procyanidins are receiving increasing attention from consumers, industry, researchers, and regulators. Objective. The objective of this study is to validate a method using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) with fluorescence detection (FLD) and a commercially available reference material for the determination of flavanols and procyanidins (CF) in cocoa-based products. Methods. Method performances were evaluated for cocoa matrices with CF content that ranged from 0.8 to 500 mg/g, which included low CF matrices (milk and dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and liquor) and high CF matrices (cocoa extract and dietary supplement products). The method was validated in a single-laboratory by determining sensitivity, selectivity, linearity, stability, robustness, accuracy, and precision for each of the matrices. Results. The method was validated for cocoa matrices with CF content that ranged from 0.8 to 500 mg/g. Accuracy ranged from 86 to 99% and repeatability (RSDr) from 1.5 to 8.6% for CF. Conclusions. Analytical performances acquired through this single-laboratory validation study for a wide range of cocoa-based matrices demonstrate that this method is fit-for-purpose for the determination of flavanols and procyanidins in cocoa-based products.

Hydrolysates from ultrafiltrated double-cream cheese whey: enzymatic hydrolysis, antioxidant, and ACE-inhibitory activities and peptide characterization.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The hydrolysis conditions (enzyme: substrate [E: S] ratio and time) of a whey protein concentrate obtained by ultrafiltration of double-cream cheese whey were optimized for the production of antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory hydrolysates; subsequently, the hydrolysates were fractionated and characterized by chromatography techniques. The results showed that the E : S ratio and time significantly affected (p< .05) the soluble protein content, free amino acids (FAA), degree of hydrolysis (DH), and antioxidant capacity. A decrease in the protein content and an increase in the FAA concentration, DH, and antioxidant activity were observed when both parameters increased. The most adequate conditions to obtain a hydrolysate with antioxidant potential were an E : S ratio of 1:20 (w/w), and time of hydrolysis of 7 hr for alcalase, 2 hr for chymotrypsin, and 6 hr for flavourzyme. After fractionation, different peptides were detected in the hydrolysates, which could contribute to antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of hydrolysates. Practical applications. Hydrolysates with antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitory activities were obtained from double-cream cheese whey, which could become in an industrial innovation strategy based on the use of by-products that can significantly impact on the circular economy of the dairy industry, the environment, and the production of functional compounds with potential use in the food, feed, pharmaceutical, or cosmetic industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bustamante, S. Z.; Gonzalez, J. G.; Sforza, S.; Tedeschi, T.							Bioactivity and peptide profile of whey protein hydrolysates obtained from Colombian double-cream cheese production and their products after gastrointestinal digestion.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Peptides obtained from whey proteins have been associated with different biological properties, but most peptides are usually degraded during the digestive process. In this work, hydrolysates were prepared from a whey protein concentrate obtained by ultrafiltration of Colombian traditional cheese whey and subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis using alcalase, chymotrypsin and flavourzyme. The antioxidant and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties were evaluated, and peptide profile was determined by ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). Changes in the above biological properties and peptide profile after simulated gastrointestinal digestion were then investigated. Before enzymatic hydrolysis, the alcalase hydrolysate showed higher 2,2′-azinobis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) radical scavenging capacity, whereas an inhibition greater than 85% of ACE activity was observed for the alcalase and chymotrypsin hydrolysates. In both tests, the flavourzyme hydrolysates showed lower activities. Different changes in the above biological activities were observed after gastrointestinal digestion of the alcalase and chymotrypsin hydrolysates: ABTS radical scavenging ability increased, whereas ACE inhibitory capacity decreased significantly. The alcalase hydrolysate obtained from ultrafiltrated whey protein concentrate showed high antioxidant and ACE inhibition capacities and higher survivability of peptides after in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.

Goat and cow milk differ in altering microbiota composition and fermentation products in rats with gut dysbiosis induced by amoxicillin.		Food & Function					Antibiotics are effective treatments for bacterial infections, however, their oral administration can have unintended consequences and may alter the gut microbiota composition. In this study, we examined the influence of antibiotics on the induction of gut dysbiosis and then evaluated the potential of cow and goat milk to restore the microbiota composition and metabolism in newly weaned rats. In the first study (gut dysbiosis model), rats were treated with amoxicillin, a mixture of antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole) or no antibiotics (control). Antibiotics reduced the rat body weights, food intakes and faecal outputs compared to the control group. Gut length was significantly decreased after the antibiotic intake. The bacterial populations (Bifidobacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp. And total bacteria) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs; acetic, butyric and propionic) concentrations in rat caecum, colon and faeces were significantly altered by the antibiotic treatments. In the second study, we examined the effects of cow and goat milk in restoring bacterial populations and metabolism in rats with gut dysbiosis induced by amoxicillin. Goat milk significantly increased the numbers of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. and decreased the numbers of Clostridium perfringens in the caecum and colon of rats treated with amoxicillin. Whereas, rats fed cow milk had higher Lactobacillus spp. and lower C. perfringens in the gut. Caecal and colonic SCFAs (acetic, butyric and propionic) concentrations differed significantly between rats fed cow and goat milk diets. Overall, goat and cow milk varied in their effects on the immature gut following antibiotic-induced dysbiosis in a rat model. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

J		Buyukcan, M. K.; Karakaya, S.							Comparison of some functional properties and protein profiles of different protein sources with egg components.		Italian Journal of Food Science					Emulsifying and foaming properties of plant and animal-sourced proteins; wheat protein hydrolysates (WP1, WP2, and WP3), potato protein isolates (PP1, PP2), pea proteins isolates (PeP1, PeP2), whey protein concentrate (WPC), and buttermilk powder (BMP) were compared with the egg white powder (EWP) and egg yolk powder (EYP). Foaming capacity, stability, emulsion activity, stability, heat stability, morphology, and electrophoretic pro-tein profiles were determined. The proteins representing competitive emulsifying functions were PeP1, WPC, and BMP. Heat treatment for 30min at 80°C remarkably reduced the emulsion activity (EA) of EYP. Our findings demonstrated that patatin-rich potato protein (PP1), an allergen-free and vegan option, has great potential to replace the foaming function of the egg white. The relationship between the protein profiles of the samples and their functional properties was further discussed in detail.										2021	33	2	142	155	1120-1770				10.15586/ijfs.v33i2.2055					FSTA:2022-07-Qa0428
J		Byanju, B.; Hojilla-Evangelista, M. P.; Lamsal, B. P.							Fermentation performance and nutritional assessment of physically processed lentil and green pea flour.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Significant amounts of nutrients, including dietary fibers, proteins, minerals, and vitamins are present in legumes, but the presence of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) like phytic acid, tannins, and enzyme inhibitors impact the consumption of legumes and nutrient availability. In this research, the effect of a physical process (sonication or precooking) and fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus acidilactici on the ANFs of some legumes was evaluated. Results. Total phenolic content was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced for modified and fermented substrates compared with non-fermented controls. Trypsin inhibitory activity (TIA) was reduced significantly for all substrates except for unsonicated soybean and lentils fermented with L. plantarum and P. acidilactici. When physical processing was done, there was a decrease in TIA for all the substrate. Phytic acid content decreased for physically modified soybean and lentil but not significantly for green pea. Even though there was a decrease in ANFs, there was no significant change in in vitro protein digestibility for all substrates except for unsonicated L. plantarum fermented soybean flour and precooked L. plantarum fermented lentil. Similarly, there was a change in amino acid content when physically modified and fermented. Conclusion. Both modified and unmodified soybean flour, green pea flour, and lentil flour supported the growth of L. plantarum and P. acidilactici. The fermentation of this physically processed legume and pulse flours influenced the non-nutritive compounds, thereby potentially improving nutritional quality and usage. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Byeong Je Kim; Ji-Bum Chung							When beef consumption becomes politicized: longitudinal change of US beef purchase intention and political values in Korea.		Food Policy					This study identified factors affecting the willingness to purchase US beef in South Korea over the decade since the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) crisis in 2008. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to assess the effects of demographics, fear of BSE, and political propensity on US beef purchase intentions. The survey dataset showed a dramatic increase in willingness to purchase, from 36.9% in 2008 to 76.1% in 2019. Analysis of the datasets identified changes in the effects of the variables over a decade. The analysis indicated that people who perceived a low level of BSE risk, males, and supporters of conservative parties were more likely to buy the US beef. In 2008, the most important determinant of US beef purchase intentions was risk perception. In 2015, after the widespread panic subsided, while there remained effects of perceived BSE risk, it was moderated by political propensity. Personal political ideology was used as a heuristic in the purchasing behavior of those who doubted the safety of US beef. Finally, the data in 2019 showed decreased effects of both risk perception and political propensity, as more than three quarters of respondents stated that they would buy US beef. Although risk can be easily politicized, it does not persist indefinitely. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	105				0306-9192				10.1016/j.foodpol.2021.102171					FSTA:2022-04-Sg1715
J		Byeong-Hyo Cho; Koyama, K.; Koseki, S.							Determination of "Hass" avocado ripeness during storage by a smartphone camera using artificial neural network and support vector regression.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Avocado undergoes quality transformation during storage, which needs to be managed in order to prevent quantity losses. A machine vision system devised with a smartphone camera was used to capture "Hass" avocado images. Color features in L* a* b* and YUV (YUV color space is defined in terms of one luminance (Y) and two chrominance components (U and Y)) were extracted from the RGB images. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were used compared for firmness estimation using the L* a* b* and YUV color features. The results indicated the ANN model is more accurate and robust than the SVR model for estimating "Hass" avocado firmness with R2, RMSE, and RPD of 0.94,0.38,4.03 respectively for the model testing data set. It was concluded that the machine vision system devised with a smartphone camera and ANN model could be a low-cost tool for the determination of ripeness of "Hass" avocado during harvest, storage, and distribution. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	2	2021	2030	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00793-7					FSTA:2021-10-Jq13785
J		Byoungjin Park; Yong-Jae Lee							Pterostilbene improves stress-related behaviors and partially reverses underlying neuroinflammatory and hormonal changes in stress-challenged mice.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Pterostilbene is a natural compound contained in various dietary sources that has received tremendous attention due to its antioxidant properties with promising benefits in cancers and vascular diseases. Currently, little is known about pterostilbene-associated neuroimmune endocrine effects. We aimed to examine the efficacy of pterostilbene for improving stress-related behaviors, neuroinflammation, and hormonal changes in a mouse stress model. To evaluate the efficacy of oral administration of pterostilbene or vehicle for 16 days for improving behavior, inflammation, and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, mice were divided into a normal control group or one of five restraint stress groups - the vehicle group; the 20, 40, or 80 mg/[kg.day] pterostilbene treatment group; or the 20 mg/ [kg.day] resveratrol treatment group. Open field and forced swimming tests were conducted. Hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels, endocrine hormone levels, oxidative stress parameters, and histopathological features were assessed. Oral pterostilbene administration significantly increased the measured times in the open field and forced swimming tests, elevated the BDNF levels, decreased the inducible nitric oxide synthase and superoxide dismutase levels in the brain, and reduced the plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone and corticosterone levels. Compared with vehicle treatment, pterostilbene dose dependently increased the numbers of neurons and decreased the numbers of glial and tumor necrosis factor alpha-immunolabeled cells in the hypothalamus. These findings suggest that pterostilbene may effectively modulate stress-related abnormal behaviors, neuroinflammation, and HPA axis hyperactivity.										2021	24	3	299	309	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.4766					FSTA:2021-08-Aj12141

Changes in compositions of galactolipids, triacylglycerols, and tocopherols of lettuce varieties (Lactuca sativa L.) with type, age, and light source.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The compositions of molecular species of structural lipids and storage lipids of two types of lettuce leaves, romaine (green leaf) and Lolla Rossa (red leaf), are reported. Lettuce was harvested at two ages, three weeks (microgreens) and eight weeks (mature), and analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Samples grown under natural light in a greenhouse were compared to those grown under grow lights. Compositions of molecular species of galactolipids (GALs), which are structural lipids, and triacylglycerols (TAGs) and diacylglycerols (DAGs), which are storage lipids, were examined relative to type (cultivar), age, and light source. GALs were most abundant, and the predominant molecular species were dilinolenoyl-monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (LnLn-MGDG) and dilinolenoyl-digalactosyldiacylglycerol (LnLn-DGDG), averaging 53.61.4% and 33.72.3% of galactolipids, respectively. TAGs containing linolenic acid (Ln) increased from three to eight weeks, especially LnLnL, LLLn, PLLn (P is palmitic acid and L is linoleic acid), and LnLnLn, with corresponding decreases in TAGs containing mostly linoleic acid, especially LLL, LLP, and LLO (O is oleic acid). alpha-Tocopherol started at similar levels in both varieties of greenhouse-grown lettuce, and it approximately tripled in Lolla Rossa, from 3.40.3 mug/g to 9.90.7 mug/g, by two LED lighting treatments.

Food Control					Mycotoxins, as a food and feed toxins, pose serious health risks for humans and animals and cause huge economic losses. Preventive measures against mycotoxins are not successful, and mycotoxins are commonly present in food and feed, which are easily contaminated. Moreover, this represents entry into the food chain, endangering all, including humans. Graphene oxide (GO) and its composites, thanks to their number of different functional groups on their surface, seem to be a promising tool for capturing and removing mycotoxins from contaminated food and feed without creating health risks or decreasing the quality of products.

J		Byung-Hoo Lee; Hyun-Wook Choi							Improved rheological properties and shelf-life of wheat starch-lipid complex produced by the homogenization process.		Food Science and Biotechnology					Physical homogenization was applied to the production of a starch-lipid complex formed through a hydrophobic interaction between amylose and fatty acid molecules. In addition, vegetable oils as a source of fatty acids and wheat starch as a source of amylose molecules were used to produce the starch-lipid complex. The complex index was significantly (p<0.05) increased through the homogenization, leading to the release of the amylose molecules from the starch granules and a high dispersibility of the fatty acids. In particular, the viscosity characteristics clearly demonstrated a dramatic improvement in the structural stability and retrogradation behavior as a result of the homogenization treatment. Vegetable oils with homogenization can be utilized to produce the starch-lipid complex as a food ingredient with an extended shelf-life and the improved rheological properties. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	4	541	544	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00889-w					FSTA:2021-08-Le1235
J		Caballero, S.; Davidov-pardo, G.							Comparison of legume and dairy proteins for the impact of Maillard conjugation on nanoemulsion formation, stability, and lutein color retention.		Food Chemistry					While dairy proteins have traditionally been used to stabilize nanoemulsions, there is a trend towards plant-based formulations. Additionally, both types of protein are poorly soluble near their isoelectric point. The main goals of this research were to develop and characterize Maillard conjugates from pea protein (PPI) or caseinate and dextran, and to evaluate the physical stability of nanoemulsions made with such emulsifiers at various ionic strengths, pH=4.6, and temperatures during storage, as well as lutein color retention over storage. Protein conjugates formed nanoemulsions with diameters of 12512 nm (PDI=0.130.00) and 26936 nm (PDI=0.760.42) (pH=7) for caseinate and PPI, respectively. Conjugation improved the physical stability (droplet size) of emulsions at the isoelectric point, during storage at 4-55 °C, and in ionic solutions. Lutein color degradation was better associated with particle size than conjugation and was lowest for PPI-stabilized emulsions. This study suggests that Maillard conjugation could improve PPI emulsification properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Eugenol, citral, and hexanal, alone or in combination with heat, affect viability, biofilm formation, and swarming on Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli.		Food Science and Biotechnology					Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains are pathogenic for humans and cause mild to severe illnesses. In this study, the antimicrobial effect of citral, eugenol, and hexanal in combination with heat shock (HS) was evaluated in terms of the growth, biofilm formation, swarming, and expression of virulence genes of STEC serotypes (O157:H7, O103, O111, and O26). Eugenol was the most effective compound against the growth of E. coli strains (MBC=0.58 to 0.73 mg/mL), followed by citral (MBC=0.86 to 1.26 mg/mL) and hexanal (MBC=2.24 to 2.52 mg/mL). Biofilm formation and swarming motility have great variability between STEC strains. Natural compounds-alone or combined with HS-inhibited biofilm formation; however, swarming motility was induced by most treatments. The expression of the studied genes during biofilm formation and swarming under natural antimicrobials was affected but not in a uniform pattern. These treatments could be used to control contamination of STEC and inhibit biofilm formation. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.

J		Cabas, B. M.; Icier, F.							Ohmic heating-assisted extraction of natural color matters from red beetroot.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The main objectives of this investigation were to investigate the combined impact of the ohmic heating-assisted extraction (OHAE) parameters (voltage gradient and frequency) and the green extraction mediums (aqueous, aqueous ethanol, acidified aqueous ethanol) on betalain yield, extraction yield, color quality, energy, and exergy efficiency, and to compare them with the effects of conventional extraction (CE) process. During the OHAE process, the betacyanins yield increased as voltage gradient increased, and the betalain was extracted better in aqueous ethanol than other extraction mediums. The color changes (Delta E, Delta C, hue angle, chroma) of the extract due to diffusion of color matters during OHAE process were higher than the CE process (p< 0.05). As the voltage gradient in OHAE increased, the energy and exergy efficiencies decreased (p< 0.05). The energy efficiencies of applications for 11 V/cm, 17 V/cm, and 23 V/cm were determined in the range of 52-64%, 38-61%, and 37-55%, respectively. On the other hand, the exergy efficiencies of aqueous, aqueous ethanol, and acidified aqueous ethanol extraction mediums were determined in the range of 29-51%, 34-64%, and 44-62%, respectively. The optimum OHAE condition was predicted by applying the desirability function method in the optimization procedure as the voltage gradient of 17 V/cm, the frequency of 400 Hz, and aqueous ethanol extraction medium. This optimum condition of OHAE for the purpose of extraction of betalains from red beet root was recommended to industrial and academic applications by taking criteria of higher exergy/energy efficiencies, lower quality changes, and shorter process times. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.			cabas, buse melek/0000-0002-2799-8654							2021	14	11	2062	2077	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02698-9					FSTA:2022-03-Jk3316

Variations of colour, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase activities during the production of low temperature dried pasta in various durum wheat genotypes.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This research was conducted to determine the effect of milling and pasta making on yellow pigment content, soluble brown pigment content, polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity and peroxidase (POD) activity in semolina and pasta derived from ten durum genotypes. Results. Showed that pasta colour was impacted more by the milling than by pasta making. The loss of yellow pigment content, POD activity, PPO activity and soluble brown pigment content due to milling was 1.3*, 4.4*, 6.2* and 17.5*, respectively, greater than losses due to pasta making. Dry pasta contained 62%, 31%, 16% and 25% of the original yellow pigment content, brown pigment content and PPO activity and POD activity in the grain, respectively. Semolina yellow pigment content had a positive effect on pasta colour while semolina protein content, ash content and speck count had negative effects. These results indicate the importance of selecting genotypes that have high yellow pigment content and excellent milling qualities. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Foods					The bee pollen is a complete and healthy food with important nutritional properties. Usually, bee pollen is consumed dehydrated, but it is possible to market it as fresh frozen pollen, favoring the maintenance of its properties and greatly increasing its palatability, compared to dried pollen. However, fresh frozen pollen maintains a high microbiological load that can include some pathogenic genus to human health. In this work, ozonation combined with drying is applied to reduce the microbiological load. The lowest timing exposure to ozone (30min) was chosen together with hot-air drying during 15min to evaluate the shelf-life of treated bee-pollen under cold storage (4°C), and initial reductions of 3, 1.5, and 1.7 log cycles were obtained for Enterobacteriaceae, mesophilic aerobes, and molds and yeasts counting, respectively. Six weeks after treatment the microbial load was held at a lower level than initially observed in fresh bee-pollen. In addition, ozone treatment did not have a negative impact on the polyphenols evaluated. Likewise, the sensory profile of the bee pollen under different treatments was studied. For all these assays the results have been favorable, so we can say that ozonation of fresh pollen is safe for human consumption, which maintains its polyphenols composition and organoleptically is better valued than dried pollen. © 2021 by the authors.

Soybean (Glycine max) hull valorization through the extraction of polyphenols by green alternative methods.		Food Chemistry					Soybean is one of the greatest crops in the world, with about 348.7 million tons being produced in 2018. Soybean hull is a by-product produced during the processing of soybean to obtain flour and oil. Though not being actually exploited, it is a source of polyphenols with antioxidant activity. Here, the extraction of polyphenols from soybean hull was performed by means of an alkaline hydrolysis treatment, which was optimized by the response surface methodology. At the optimal region, a total phenolic content of 0.72 g gallic acid equivalents per 100 g of soybean hull was obtained with an antioxidant activity of 2.17 mmoles of Trolox equivalents. Polyphenols responsible for the antioxidant activities were identified by LC-MS, including phenolic acids, anthocyanins, stilbenes, and the two main isoflavones of soybean, daidzein and genistein, in their non-glycosylated form. Other alternative extraction methods based on Aspergillus oryzae fermentation and alpha-amylase hydrolysis are also proposed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Exploring the DPP-IV inhibitory, antioxidant and antibacterial potential of ovine "scotta" hydrolysates.		Foods					The aim of this work was to valorize the by-product derived from the ricotta cheese process (scotta). In this study, ovine scotta was concentrated by ultrafiltration and then subjected to enzymatic hydrolyses using proteases of both vegetable (4% E:S, 4 h, 50°C) and animal origin (4% E:S, 4 h, 40°C). The DPP-IV inhibitory, antioxidant, and antibacterial activities of hydrolysates from bromelain (BSPH) and pancreatin (PSPH) were measured in vitro. Both the obtained hydrolysates showed a significantly higher DPP-IV inhibitory activity compared to the control. In particular, BSPH proved to be more effective than PSPH (IC50 8.5 0.2 vs. 13 1mg mL-1). Moreover, BSPH showed the best antioxidant power, while PSPH was more able to produce low-MW peptides. BSPH and PSPH hydrolysates showed a variable but slightly inhibitory effect depending on the species or strain of bacteria tested. BSPH and PSPH samples were separated by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). LC-MS/MS analysis of selected GPC fractions allowed identification of differential peptides. Among the peptides 388 were more abundant in BSPH than in the CTRL groups, 667 were more abundant in the PSPH group compared to CTRL, and 97 and 75 of them contained sequences with a reported biological activity, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Kaolin, Ascophyllum nodosum and salicylic acid mitigate effects of summer stress improving hazelnut quality.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Various strategies are needed to mitigate the negative impact on or to increase fruit quality. The effect of spraying kaolin (K), Ascophyllum nodosum (An) and salicylic acid (SA), in trees with and without irrigation, on quality and sensorial attributes of hazelnut (Grada de Viseu cultivar) was investigated during two consecutive years (2016 and 2017) in a commercial orchard located in Moimenta da Beira, Portugal. Results. The treatments affected positively the biometric parameters nut and kernel weight, length, width, thickness and volume as well as the vitamin E level, antioxidant activity and content of some individual phenolics, such as protocatechuic acid, gallocatechin, catechin and epicatechin. The levels of amino acids in hazelnut kernels decreased in all the assayed treatments, while the kernel colour and sensorial attributes were not affected by the treatments. Hazelnut physical properties (nut and kernels), chemical and phytochemical composition and antioxidant activities were positively related. Conclusions. The application of K, An and SA improved the hazelnut tree response to climate change, without compromising the hazelnut chemical and sensorial quality. Furthermore, due to the similar observations for the same treatments with and without irrigation, it can be stated that K, An and SA can be efficient and cost-effective tools to mitigate summer stress in rain-fed orchards. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Passiflora edulis fo. flavicarpa (Passifloraceae) is popularly known as yellow passion fruit and its fruit peels are considered a rich by-product in bioactive compounds which has greatly beneficial health properties. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of P. edulis fruit peel extracts in a type 1 diabetes model and the potential vasorelaxant effect. The aqueous and hydroethanolic extracts were obtained from P. edulis fruit peels and orientin and isorientin flavonoids were identified in both extracts through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. Pectin was only identified in the aqueous extract by high-performance steric exclusion chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance. Regarding the vascular system, the hydroethanolic extract showed better vasorelaxant effects in the mesenteric artery rings when compared to the aqueous extract. These effects mainly occur by opening the potassium channels. In the type 1 diabetes model, extracts at doses of 400 and 600mg/kg were able to restore the effect of insulin in diabetic rats which were not responding to its action. The antidiabetic effect was more significant for the aqueous extract. Thus, the results suggest that the hydroethanolic and aqueous extracts have greater potential to be used to treat cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and as a hypoglycemic agent, respectively. Taken together, P. edulis fruit peel extracts proved to be a source of valuable bioactive raw material to produce nutraceuticals or pharmaceutical products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science + Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.		de Medeiros, Isac Almeida/C-5784-2013	de Medeiros, Isac Almeida/0000-0001-8783-4806							2021	76	4	466	471	0921-9668				10.1007/s11130-021-00921-8					FSTA:2022-09-Jg12108

Journal of Food Process Engineering					Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most important gas used in modified atmosphere packaging of nonrespiring foods. In this technique, the gas solubilizes into the aqueous and lipid phases of food and exerts an antimicrobial effect. In the present study, the solubility SCO2 and effective diffusion coefficient DCO2 of CO2 in fresh cheese (type Minas Frescal) were determined at 4, 7, and 10°C by a manometric method. The DCO2 value was obtained using the mathematical modeling (transient mass transfer and Fick's law) and a numerical procedure (exhaustive search method) to minimize the error between experimental and predicted values. The highest solubility value was obtained at 4°C, resulting from combined effects of temperature and complex phase transitions in fat content, shown by differential scanning calorimetry curves. Higher SCO2 values corresponded to lower DCO2. Solubility and effective diffusion coefficient are important parameters for designing and developing new food products and food processes. Practical Applications. This study presented a procedure to quantify the mass transfer of CO2 gas in fresh cheese. The knowledge of the CO2 transfer properties in food can help the industry concerning about the choice of the amount and composition of the gas used in modified atmosphere packaging. In which, a gaseous mixture (CO2/N2) is introduced into packaging resulting in the extension of the cheese shelf life. Additionally, the procedure used in cheese can be easily extended to estimate the transfer properties of CO2 in other nonrespiring food. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of Debaryomyces hansenii and the antifungal PgAFP protein on Alternaria spp. growth, toxin production, and RHO1 gene expression in a tomato-based medium.		Food Microbiology					Tomato fruit is susceptible to Alternaria spp. spoilage, which poses a health risk due to their mycotoxin production. Biopreservation relies on the use of whole microorganisms or their metabolites to manage spoilage microorganisms including filamentous fungi. However, the use of treatments at fungistatic level might activate intracellular pathways, which can cause an increment in mycotoxin accumulation. The objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of two strains of Debaryomyces hansenii and the antifungal protein PgAFP at 10 and 40 mug/mL. Both growth and production of two of the most common mycotoxins (tenuazonic acid and alternariol monomethyl ether) by Alternaria tenuissima sp.-grp. and Alternaria arborescens sp.-grp. on a tomato-based matrix, were analysed at 12 °C. Additionally, the impact of these biocontrol agents on the stress-related RHO1 gene expression was assessed. All treatments reduced mycotoxin accumulation (from 27 to 92% of inhibition). Their mode of action against Alternaria spp. in tomato seems unrelated to damages to fungal cell wall integrity at the genomic level. Therefore, the two D. hansenii strains (CECT 10352 and CECT 10353) and the antifungal protein PgAFP at 10 mug/mL are suggested as biocontrol strategies in tomato fruit at postharvest stage.

J		Cabrera, L. C.; Pastor, P. M.			European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				The 2019 European Union report on pesticide residues in food.		EFSA Journal					Under European Union legislation (Article 32, Regulation (EC) No 396/2005), the EFSA provides an annual report which examines pesticide residue levels in foods on the European market. This report is based on data from the official national control activities carried out by EU Member States, Iceland and Norway and includes a subset of data from the EU-coordinated control programme which uses a randomised sampling strategy. For 2019, 96.1% of the overall 96,302 samples analysed fell below the maximum residue level (MRL), 3.9% exceeded this level, of which 2.3% were non-compliant, i.e. samples exceeding the MRL after taking the measurement uncertainty into account. For the subset of 12,579 samples analysed as part of the EU-coordinated control programme, 2.0% exceeded the MRL and 1.0% were non-compliant. To assess acute and chronic risk to consumer health, dietary exposure to pesticide residues was estimated and compared with health-based guidance values. The findings suggest that the residue levels for the food commodities analysed are unlikely to pose any concern for consumer health. However, a number of recommendations are proposed to increase the effectiveness of European control systems, thereby continuing to ensure a high level of consumer protection throughout the EU. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Fluorescence study of four olive varieties paste according to sampling dates and the control in the elaboration of table olives of "Ascolana tenera".		Food Analytical Methods					A fluorescence method combined with chemometric algorithms has been developed for the fruit characterization of four olive varieties ("Arbequina," "Piantone di Falerone," "Piantone di Mogliano," and "Maurino") cultivated in Marche (Italy) according to sampling dates. The score values obtained by parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) were correlated with the hydroxytyrosol and oleuropein concentrations quantified by liquid chromatographic. The analysis of excitation-emission matrices by PARAFAC and unfolding partial least squares, using the three component score values, allowed to differentiate between varieties. The use of the scores of oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, which were represented each other, allowed to highlight differences between the three sampling dates. Furthermore, a good discrimination of fresh olive, lye table olives, and natural table olives was also achieved in "Ascolana tenera," another typical olive variety of Marche. Results. Can be explained by the changes of concentration of tyrosol and oleuropein due to the elaboration method characteristics. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Cabrita, M. J.; Pires, A.; Burke, A. J.; Garcia, R.							Seeking a fast screening method of the varietal origin of olive oil: the usefulness of an NMR-based approach.		Foods					This work encompasses the use of 1D multinuclear NMR spectroscopy, namely,1H NMR and13C NMR DEPT 45, combined with a multivariate statistical analysis to characterize olive oils produced from nine different varieties: Galega Vulgar, Cobrancosa, Cordovil de Serpa, Blanqueta, Madural, Verdeal Alentejana, Arbequina, Picual and Carrasquenha. Thus, the suitability of an NMR-based spectroscopic tool to discriminate olive oils according to their varietal origin is addressed. The results obtained show that the model based on13C NMR DEPT 45 data has a stronger performance than the model based on1H NMR data, proving to be promising in the discrimination of the olive oils under study based on their varietal origin, being particularly relevant for olive oils of the Galega Vulgar variety. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cabuk, B.							Influence of grasshopper (Locusta Migratoria) and mealworm (Tenebrio Molitor) powders on the quality characteristics of protein rich muffins: nutritional, physicochemical, textural and sensory aspects.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Insects are the most common animal group in the world and they constitute about 80% of the animal kingdom. Today, around 1600 insect species have been consumed by humans. The aim of this study was to explore the potential use of edible insect flours for the production of protein rich muffins. Proximate composition and sensory quality of muffins were also explored. The protein and fat content of resulting muffins were effectively improved. While grasshopper powder provided 12.91 0.40% protein content, mealworm powder enhancement obtained 36.56 1.26% fat content compared with control (p ≤ 0.05). Physical properties of resulting muffins were also investigated. GR-M sample presented the highest baking yield of 88.66 0.58%. On the other hand, fortification with edible insect powders led to have denser structures with the lower specific volume than the control; incorporation of 15% with mealworm powder obtained the lowest specific volume (1.14 0.02 cm3/g). As regard to textural parameters, inclusion of edible insect flours also affected the textural properties; muffins fortified with grasshopper powder showed a significantly (p ≤ 0.05) softer crumb with lower springiness, cohesiveness and chewiness while no significant differences (p > 0.05) in all textural properties except cohesiveness and adhesiveness between used insect types were observed. Sensory characteristics revealed that fortification of wheat flour by mealworm powder provided a muffin with liking score ranged from 6.70 to 8.70 for all attributes tested, therefore, indicating that mealworm powder could be an effective ingredient in increasing nutritional value of bakery products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Non-destructive near infrared spectroscopy for the labelling of frozen Iberian pork loins.		Meat Science					Iberian pigs fed on acorns and pasture were slaughtered from January until March of 2018 and 2019. The meat from those Iberian pigs is a seasonal food that only can be found fresh, at the marketplace, during a limit period of the year. Selling frozen-thawed meat is a legal practice, but consumers must be informed about it on the product label. However, to declare as fresh meat, meat previously frozen, is one of the most frequent meat frauds. The present study compares the performance of two rather different Near Infrared Spectroscopy instruments, based on Fourier Transform and Linear Variable Filter technologies, for the in-situ detection of fresh and frozen-thawed acorns-fed Iberian pig loins using Partial Least Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA). The performance of the models developed for both instruments offered a very high discriminant ability. Furthermore, the models showed consistent results and interpretation when were evaluated with several scalars and graphical methods. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Analytical Methods					The present study describes the miniaturization of the conventional methodologies for determining the total phenol and flavonoid concentrations and the antioxidant activities using DPPH, ABTS, and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) methods. The amount of reagents used was reduced 25, 5.0, 3.6, 3.0, and 3.3 times relative to the conventional methodologies, representing a 67-96% reduction in the analysis costs. The miniaturized and conventional methodologies presented similar linearity in the same concentration range, with the determination and correlation coefficients greater than 0.99. The accuracy of the methodologies was evidenced by the relative standard deviations, which remained below 3%. The 38 samples comprising alcoholic beverages, teas, spices, jams, energy drinks, honey products, and grape derivatives analyzed using the two methodologies (miniaturized and conventional) presented similar average values. Therefore, the miniaturized methodology is proposed as an efficient, safe, and economical alternative to the conventional methods for determining the total phenol and flavonoid concentrations and the antioxidant activities using DPPH, ABTS, and FRAP methods in various matrices. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Cadenas, R.; Caballero, I.; Nimubona, D.; Blanco, C. A.							Brewing with starchy adjuncts: its influence on the sensory and nutritional properties of beer.		Foods					In brewing, the use of cereals (wheat, barley, maize, rice, sorghum, oats, rye or millet), pseudo-cereals (buckwheat, quinoa or amaranth) and tubers (sweet potato), as starch adjuncts, is being promoted for the production of a variety of high-quality beers, from sensory and nutritional points of view. The sensory properties of the obtained beer depend on the characteristics of each adjunct but also on the forms in which the adjunct is added: whole cereal, grits, malted, extruded grains, torrefied and syrup. Among these common forms, the extruded grains (maize or rice) produce a higher content of aroma compounds in beer. From a nutritional point of view, the use of non-conventional starch adjuncts, such as black rice, buckwheat or sweet potato, leads to an increase in the polyphenol content of the beer, and thus, its antioxidant capacity. Cereals such as maize, rice, sorghum or millet are the most promising for the production of gluten-free beers. A close relationship can be developed between the use of adjuncts in the beer industry and the use of commercial enzymes. Advances made by biotechnology to design new enzymes with different functionalities could be associated to a future increase in adjunct usage in brewing. © 2021 by the authors.

Characterization of Rubus fruticosus L. berries growing wild in Morocco: phytochemical screening, antioxidant activity and chromatography analysis.		European Food Research and Technology					Rubus fruticosus L. is a widespread shrub species which has recently attracted a great attention due a plethora of different pharmacological activities. A comparative study of the volatile profile and polyphenols along with the antioxidant activity of 27 blackberries collected in 3 different locations of the Tangier-Tetouan-Al Hoceima region in Northern Morocco, between June and August 2018, is reported. In terms of antioxidant activity, the highest IC50 values were attained for the Rubus fruticosus EtOAc extract coming from Beni Messaouar (2.5 mg/mL0.01). Concerning the volatile content of the Rubus fruticosus n-hexane extract belonging to Beni Messaouar, a total of 42 compounds were detected and oleic acid turned out to be the most abundant one (14.49%), whereas among the 29 polyphenols detected in the Rubus fruticosus EtOAc extract, coming from the same location, quercetin-3-O-glucoside occurred in major concentration (364.58 mg/kg). This is the first report on the physico-chemical and phytochemical properties of Moroccan Rubus fruticosus highlighting how these fruits do have a great potential as natural source of antioxidant compounds to be used as a nutraceuticals or functional foods. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	7	1689	1699	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03739-5					FSTA:2021-10-Jf13444

Food Research International					Khaya senegalensis A. Juss (Meliaceae) is a popular medicinal plant, widely used in the management of various ailments in the African traditional medicine. This study attempts to investigate into the different extraction methods (homogenizer-assisted extraction (HAE), maceration (MAC), infusion and Soxhlet (SE) extraction) on the pharmacological properties and chemical profiles of K. senegalensis. Antioxidant properties and inhibitory potential against key enzymes were assessed and bioinformatics analysis was conducted on selected limonoids to predict putative pharmacokinetics and protein targets underlying the pharmacological effects. Overall, the leaf extracts showed notable flavonoid (20.59-104.43 mg RE/g) content and the stem barks extracts displayed the highest total phenolic (87.69-46.28 mg GAE/g), phenolic acid (62.96-107.22 mg CE/g), flavanol (3.60-135.40 mg CAE/g) contents. All extracts showed remarkable antioxidant activities, with the MAC-Water leaf extract being most active in all the assays. Regarding stem bark, the MAC-MeOH extract exerted the highest free radical scavenging abilities, while HAE and MAC extracts were better sources of reducing agent and metal chelators. The HAE-MeOH, MAC-Water, and SE extracts showed noteworthy inhibitory activity against AChE, BChE (only stem barks), tyrosinase and alpha-glucosidase (only stem barks). All extracts displayed moderate inhibitory activities against alpha-amylase. The bioinformatics approach showed that khayanoside A and C interacted with multiple isoforms of metalloproteinase, while humilin B and khayanone interacted with opioid receptors. To sum up, the chemical profiles and biological activities of K. senegalensis were closely dependent on the extraction methods. Results. Amassed from this study showed that K. senegalensis is a potent source of bioactive compounds which could be explored as a functional food.

Nutritional information on these two species were evaluated as well as their potential health impact. Fat, protein, carbohydrates, dry matter, minerals, vitamin C, and pesticides were monitored in raw and cooked snails. An intake of 100 g of cooked snails of O. lactea and T. pisana species provide 34.8 kcal and 39.5 kcal, respectively, which represents 1.74% and 1.97% of the total energy in a 2000 kcal daily diet. The low caloric content is due to the small amount of fat and total carbohydrates, but the snails contain a healthy amount of protein and minerals. The most abundant nutritional minerals were calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, magnesium, iron, manganese, and zinc. Both species of snails also contained other important minerals such as molybdenum, chromium, nickel, cobalt, copper, selenium, and silicon, although at lower concentrations. For both species, the hazard quotient was lower than 0.3 for all target minerals. The hazard index was 0.86 and 0.70 for T. pisana and O. lactea cooked snails, respectively. None of the species showed residues of pesticides. Both snails could be an alternative to conventional livestock and their meats. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Caetano-Silva, M. E.; Rund, L. A.; Vailati-Riboni, M.; Pacheco, M. T. B.; Johnson, R. W.							Copper-binding peptides attenuate microglia inflammation through suppression of NF-kB pathway.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Activation of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, has been related to the etiology and progression of neurodegenerative diseases; thus, finding novel approaches to suppress the neuroinflammatory process is of utmost relevance. Methods and Results. The anti-inflammatory activity of whey Cu-, Fe-, and Zn-binding peptides and their possible underlying mechanism of action were evaluated in microglia. Whey metal-binding peptides decreased nitric oxide production and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) at mRNA and protein levels by stimulated BV-2 microglia in comparison to the control with no peptide treatment. The hydrophobicity, specific sequences, and possible synergistic effects seem to play a role. Cu-binding peptides (Cu-bp) presented anti-inflammatory activity both in BV-2 and primary microglia cultures. These peptides exert their action by suppressing nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) pathway since nuclear translocation of NF-kB p65 is decreased by roughly 30% upon Cu-bp treatment. Specific sequences identified in Cu-bp showed high affinity to bind NF-kB p65 by molecular docking (up to-8.8 kcal mol-1), corroborating the immunofluorescence studies. Conclusion. Cu-bp represent food-derived peptides that may be useful for neuroprotective purposes. Chelation of copper excess in the CNS and the bioavailability of such peptides, as well as their behavior in in vivo models, deserve further research for future applications. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The isomeric nature of monoterpenyl glycosides makes unambiguous identification of intact glycosides difficult. As a result, it is challenging to relate the changes in free monoterpenol concentrations to the corresponding glycosides during wine fermentation and storage. In this study, we isolated and identified linalool, nerol, and geraniol monoterpenyl glycosides from Vitis vinifera cv. Riesling grapes through fractionation followed by acid or enzyme hydrolysis. Changes in the composition of identified monoterpenyl glycosides and their respective free volatiles were then monitored during alcoholic fermentations of Riesling juice with four different yeast strains across two successive years. The relative concentrations of the volatiles were monitored by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography mass spectrometry, while ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used for intact glycosides. Glycoside hydrolysis during fermentation could be related to relative concentrations of the corresponding free aglycones. However, other sources of free monoterpenols were also observed. Differences in glycoside hydrolysis among yeast strains and across years were observed and may be related to grape maturity and/or nutrient levels.

J		Caglar, A. F.; Cakir, B.; Gulseren, I.							LC-Q-TOF/MS based identification and in silico verification of ACE-inhibitory peptides in Giresun (Turkey) hazelnut cakes.		European Food Research and Technology					Hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cakes represent are a rich source of proteins. In an effort to valorize industrially cold-pressed hazelnut cakes, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory characteristics of hazelnut protein hydrolysates were evaluated. Trypsin, chymotrypsin and thermolysin hydrolysates of hazelnut protein isolates were fractionated using Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC). The hydrolysate fractions were tested for ACE inhibitory characteristics and inhibitor peptide identification was based on Liquid Chromatography Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF/MS). Finally, in vitro ACE inhibitory activity was verified using in silico tools. In all cases, some hydrolysate fractions demonstrated ACE inhibitory characteristics, while inhibitory activity widely varied (7-95%) depending on proteolysis conditions. In ACE inhibitory fractions, 179 different peptides were identified. Their potential inhibitory activity was verified in silico for 22 different peptides generated by thermolysin, 3 for chymotrypsin and 4 for trypsin. While the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) (0.13-4.83 mg ml-1) values were comparable to the previous literature, currently identified sequences were different than ACE inhibitory peptides purified from Asian hazelnuts. The peptides with the highest PeptideRanker scores for each treatment (i.e., SPLAGR, VPHW and PGHF) were studied for their potential ACE binding, Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion and Toxicity (ADMET) and circulatory half-life characteristics demonstrating limited pharmokinetic interference, low toxicity as well as comparable short circulation and stronger binding compared to a reference inhibitor peptide (i.e., VPP). Geographical attributes and proteolytic treatments could have a bearing on ACE inhibitory potential of peptides, while hazelnut cakes can be regarded as a valuable resource for ACE inhibitor peptides. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Caglar, D.; Ergun, A. R.; Baysal, T.							Effects of microwave pasteurization on the thermal resistance of Zygosaccharomyces rouxii and on the physicochemical properties of organic intermediate moisture raisin.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, organic intermediate moisture raisin was pasteurized with microwave and conventional pasteurization methods. The thermal resistance (D and z values) of the target yeast, Zygosaccharomyces rouxii, was determined for both methods at different temperatures 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C and at different time intervals. The effect of pasteurization methods on the quality properties of raisin samples was investigated. The D values of Z. rouxii were found as 6.500.49,2.960.02,1.910.01 min for conventional treatment and 3.460.31,2.020.14 and 10.01 min for microwave treatment at 60 °C, 70 °C, and 80 °C, respectively. F8537 values for 5-log reduction and come-up time significantly decreased after microwave pasteurization. Brix, acidity, and color values were preserved better by microwave treatment. Hydroxymethylfurfural content of the microwave pasteurized samples was found 42% less than the samples pasteurized conventionally. Microwave pasteurization can be alternatively used for the conventional method for raisin improving quality with less heating time. Practical applications. Microwave heating needs less come-up time rather than conventional pasteurization. Decreasing process time provides advantageous via the costs and energy saving so organic intermediate moisture fruits that are perishable can be safely pasteurized by a microwave method for longer shelf life in the industry. Z. rouxii, which may be found in high sugar content foods, can be inactivated to the target log that provides the fruit safe by using this method. In addition, quality properties, such as color, which is effective on the consumer preference also, protected better by the effect of volumetric heating. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15382					FSTA:2021-08-Jg10421
J		Cai Ling Ang; Kelvin Kim Tha Goh; Kaiyang Lim; Matia-Merino, L.							Rheological characterization of a physically-modified waxy potato starch: investigation of its shear-thickening mechanism.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study focuses on the rheological characterization of the time-and shear-dependence of a physically modified waxy potato starch through treatment at 120°C for 30min under continuous stirring. The starch sample exhibited time-dependency, where the viscosity increased with time at constant shear rates between 5 and 60s-1. Shear-induced gelation was also observed when the sample was sheared above 100s-1. The gel structure remained relatively stable within the experimental timeframe of 72h at 20°C. A minimum starch concentration of 1% w/w was required for shear-thickening and anti-thixotropy to be observed. This study showed that the formation of a shear-induced weak gel structure was not caused solely by hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, hydrophobic interactions or a combination of these forces. The formation of a weak gel structure was probably initiated first by shear which orientated the amylopectin molecules in the direction of shear. The "stretched" amylopectin molecules subsequently facilitated closer proximity between polymer chains which promoted intermolecular association between polymer chains to take place.

J		Cai Ling Ang; Matia-Merino, L.; Kaiyang Lim; Goh, K. K. T.							Molecular and physico-chemical characterization of de-structured waxy potato starch.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study focuses on the physico-chemical properties of a "clean-label" modified starch (de-structured starch) as a potential food ingredient. The modified starch was obtained by the disassembly of native waxy potato starch granules into its macromolecular chains. Waxy potato starch samples were treated at elevated temperatures of 120,130, 140, and 150 °C for 30 min at a stirring speed of 300 rpm in a high pressure reactor. Starch treated at 120 °C showed similar molar mass as its native form indicating that treatment at 120 °C had resulted in the disassembly of the starch granules into its macromolecular chains. Reduction in viscosity and particle size was observed with increased temperature from 120 to 150 °C. The reduction in viscosity and size was not only attributed to the disassembly of starch granules into its macromolecular fractions but also due to a further size reduction of amylopectin chains. De-structured starch treated at 140 and 150 °C exhibited flow behavior approaching Newtonian fluid. However, de-structured starch treated at 120 and 130 °C exhibited shear-thickening behavior above their critical shear rates at 14 and 27 s-1 respectively. Shear-induced interactions among starch macromolecular fractions appeared to have occurred within a narrow range of heat treatment (120 and 130 °C) but not in more severely heat-treated starches (140 and 150 °C).

J		Cai-Lin Kong; Na Ma; Jian Yin; Hong-Yu Zhao; Yong-Sheng Tao							Fine tuning of medium chain fatty acids levels increases fruity ester production during alcoholic fermentation.		Food Chemistry					Pichia fermentans Z9Y-3 and its intracellular enzymes were inoculated along with S. cerevisiae in synthetic grape must to modulate fruity ester production. The levels of ester-related enzymes, ester precursors, and fruity esters were monitored every 24 h during fermentation. Results showed that the levels of ethyl acetate, acetate higher alcohol esters (AHEs), short chain fatty acid ethyl esters (SFEs), and medium chain fatty acid ethyl esters (MFEs) were significantly enhanced in mixed fermentation. Pearson correlation analysis further revealed that higher alcohols and fatty acids played a more important role in fruity ester production than enzymes; Particularly, the correlation coefficient between fatty acids and MFEs was 0.940. In addition, supplementation of medium chain fatty acids (7.2 mg/L) at the metaphase of single S. cerevisiae fermentation improved ethyl acetate, AHE, SFE, and MFE production by 42.56%, 21.00%, 61.33%, and 90.04%, respectively, although the high level of ethyl acetate might result in off-flavors.

Food Bioscience					Black soybean seed (BSS) is a traditional edible and medical food. The cotyledons of BSS are either yellow or green, but that difference's effect on functional and bioactivities are not clear. In the present study, the concentrations of the main functional components, including anthocyanins, isoflavones, fatty acids, protein, and polysaccharides, and in vitro antioxidant activities of yellow-cotyledon and green-cotyledon BSS (YBS and GBS, respectively) were compared. The anti-fatigue activities of the ethanol extract of BSS (EEB) were evaluated using mouse swimming endurance tests. Additionally, a metabolomics comparison between YBS and GBS was done using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS) on high doses of EEB-treated mouse plasma. The results indicated that YBS showed significantly higher contents of anthocyanin and protein, and stronger antioxidant activity and anti-fatigue activity than GBS; while GBS showed higher levels of isoflavone, stearic acid, and polysaccharide. By infusing the feed with EEB, the swimming time of mice increased in a dose-dependent manner. The metabolomics results suggested that the anti-fatigue effect of EEB correlated well with serotonin and melatonin biosynthesis in vivo. All of the above results showed that BSS has anti-fatigue potential and might be used as a potential source of functional food ingredients.

Colonic metabolites from digested Moringa oleifera leaves induced HT-29 cell death via apoptosis, necrosis, and autophagy.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Colorectal cancer is an important concern in modern society. Risk factors such as the diet indicate the need to find healthy food products displaying additional health benefits. This study aimed to characterise and evaluate the impact of the colonic metabolites from the fermented non-digestible fraction of Moringa oleifera (MO) leaves (FNFM) on cell death mechanisms from HT-29 cells. MO leaves were digested in vitro, and the 12 h-colonic extract was obtained. FNFM mainly contained morin and chlorogenic acids (41.97 and 25.33 g/g sample). Butyric acid was ranked as the most important metabolite of FNFM. The FNFM exerted antiproliferative effect against HT-29 colorectal cancer cells (half lethal concentration, LC50: 5.9 mL/100mL). Compared to untreated control, LC50 increased H2O2 production (149.43%); induced apoptosis (119.02%), autophagy (75.60%), and necrosis (87.72%). These results suggested that digested MO colonic metabolites exert antiproliferative effect against HT-29 cells, providing additional health benefits associated with MO consumption. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					A bacterium identified as Bacillus velezensis with a growth inhibitory effect against Fusarium solani, a pathogen that caused basal stem rot in the passion fruit Passiflora edulis, was isolated in this study. From the fermentation broth of B. velezensis, a type of antifungal peptide (named BVAP) with a molecular weight of ca. 1.5 kDa was purified and found to be fengycin. BVAP suppressed mycelial growth in F. solani with an IC50 of 5.58 mug/mL, which was superior to those of the chemical fungicides thiram (41.24 mug/mL) and hymexazol (343.31 mug/mL). The antifungal activity remained stable after exposure to 50-100°C or following incubation with solutions at pH 1-3. Further research revealed that BVAP increased the permeability of the F. solani mycelial membrane, brought about swelling at the tips of hyphae, and elicited abnormal accumulation of nucleic acids and chitin at the sites of swelling. These findings indicate that BVAP possessed a remarkable biocontrol potential toward F. solani.										2021	69	7	2051	2061	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c06106					FSTA:2021-07-Jg8357

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The effects of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) on nitric oxide (NO)/guanosine 3′,5′-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP)-activated gamma-aminobutiric acid (GABA) accumulation and the role of GABA in isoflavone biosynthesis in response to UV-B exposure in soybean sprouts were investigated. The sprouts were sprayed using donors and inhibitors of cGMP and NO as well as inhibitors of GSK-3 and GABA. It turned out that GSK-3, as a second messenger, mediated NO/cGMP/PKG-induced GABA accumulation by activating diamine oxidase (DAO) under UV-B treatment. GABA mediated NO/cGMP/PKG/GSK-3-stimulated the increment of gene and protein expression and activity of chalcone synthase (CHS) and isoflavone synthase (IFS), and consequently induced the elevation in isoflavone content. Overall, GABA mediates NO/cGMP/PKG/GSK-3-stimulated isoflavone production in response to UV-B exposure in soybean sprouts.

J		Caifeng Jiao							IP3 mediates NO-enhanced chilling tolerance in postharvest kiwifruit.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The function of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) in nitric oxide (NO)-induced chilling tolerance in postharvest kiwifruit was revealed. The fruit were treated using sodium nitroprusside (SNP; exogenous NO donor) and neomycin (IP3 inhibitor). Data demonstrated that compared with the control, chilling injury (CI) index and firmness decreased and increased upon SNP treatment in kiwifruit. SNP treatment enhanced phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) activity, and consequently induced IP3 production. Moreover, SNP treatment down regulated malondialdehyde (MDA) content and electrolyte leakage as well as the activity and gene expression of lipoxygenase (LOX) in kiwifruit. In addition, the gene expression of transcription factors, including C-repeat binding factor1 (CBF1), WRKY1 and NAC5 was induced by SNP treatment. The above effects induced upon SNP treatment were inhibited by neomycin treatment. Neomycin treatment alone also led to the increase in CI index, MDA content and electrolyte leakage as well as the activity and gene expression of LOX, and the decrease in firmness, PI-PLC activity and IP3 production and gene expression of CBF1, WRKY1 and NAC5. Thus, IP3 mediated the alleviation of membrane damage, and the induction of CBF1, WRKY1 and NAC5 by SNP, thereby delaying CI in kiwifruit.

International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					This study aimed to evaluate the associations between fruit and vegetable (FV) intake and the risk of prediabetes or type 2 diabetes (T2D). It is a cross-sectional study that involved 6802 participants aged 18-65 years. Dietary intake and other variables were assessed by questionnaires. The prevalence of prediabetes and T2D was ascertained by self-report and analyses of fasting blood samples. In the multiple logistic regression models, FV intake was negatively associated the risk of T2D in women (OR=0.45, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.71), whereas no such association was observed in men (OR=0.98, 95% CI: 0.65, 1.47). Furthermore, FV consumption was inversely associated with prediabetes risk in men and women. Results suggested that higher intake of FV was associated with a decreased risk of T2D or prediabetes in Chinese women and a reduced risk of prediabetes in men only. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	72	2	208	218	0963-7486				10.1080/09637486.2020.1780567					FSTA:2021-07-Ja8652
J		Caihu Liao; Yigang Yu							Effect of vacuum cooling followed by ozone repressurization on Clostridium perfringens germination and outgrowth in cooked pork meat under temperature-abuse conditions.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The effect of combining vacuum cooling with an ozone-based inhibition process (InhVac) on Clostridium perfringens spore germination and outgrowth in cooked pork meat after exponential chilling (from 54.4 to 7.2 °C in 12, 15, 18, or 21 h) and isothermal storage (20, 25, 30, 36, or 45 °C) was evaluated. Ice cooling (IC) and vacuum cooling (VC) were used to compare the effects with InhVac. The samples were inoculated with a three-strain mixture of C. perfringens spores to obtain concentration of ca. 3 log10 CFU/g. C. perfringens growth in samples treated by InhVac were 0.1,0.37 and 0.9 log10 CFU/g after 15, 18 and 21 h of cooling from 54.4 to 7.2 °C respectively, significantly lower (P<0.05) than those in samples subjected to IC (1.01, 2.10 and 2.8 log10 CFU/g) and VC (0.56, 1.01 and 2.13 log10 CFU/g). Compared to VC and IC, InhVac treatment increased the lag phase (lambda), decreased the growth rates (mumax), and extended the sample shelf-life (the time until a 1 log10 CFU/g increase in C. perfringes from the initial concentration value) at all storage temperatures. InhVac-treated samples not only had a longer shelf-life than those treated by VC, but also exhibited almost two times longer shelf-life compared to those subjected to IC regardless of storage temperatures. Additionally, statistical indexes showed that a primary modified Gompertz model and a secondary Square Root model could fit the data well. Industrial relevance In this study, an innovative inhibition approach (InhVac) was found to show a better antimicrobial effect on C. perfringens germination and outgrowth in cooked pork meat compared to ice cooling and vacuum cooling under temperature-abuse conditions. A primary modified Gompertz model and a secondary Square Root model could be used to predict the C. perfringens growth in samples subjected to InhVac treatment.

This study aimed to investigate the antioxidant properties of vine tea extracts and evaluate their inhibition effect on lipid oxidation. In this study, total flavonoids, phenolics, and anthocyanins content of four leaf extracts were determined from leaves of different ages and colors. In addition, the antioxidant ability of these extracts was evaluated by determining the ferric reducing antioxidant power, DPPH. and .OH scavenging activity, and lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity. The results revealed that the extracts, especially from young leaf samples, could effectively scavenge radicals and inhibit lipid oxidation, indicating their antioxidant ability. Compared to BHT, vine tea extracts significantly inhibited the increase of POV and TBARS in sunflower and rapeseed oils.

Food Hydrocolloids					Although tributyrin has great benefits for intestinal health, it suffers from unpleasant sensory qualities, low solubility, and low bioavailability. Microencapsulation may provide a way to avoid these limitations. Our previous study reported a new method for encapsulating tributyrin during enzymatic cyclodextrin synthesis, and this study compared the performance of tributyrin microcapsules prepared using this method (CGT) with those prepared using other common microcapsule wall materials. The results showed that CGT were slightly inferior to those prepared using maltodextrin in tests of tributyrin retention and microcapsule morphology, but significantly superior to those prepared using beta-cyclodextrin, perhaps due to greater inclusion space. More importantly, CGT had the highest emulsion stability (93.21%) and showed superior controlled release of their tributyrin content in a model of the mammalian intestine (65.50%). These findings demonstrate the utility of CGT and its preparation method, and further illuminate the relationship between wall material type and microcapsule performance.

During the saccharification process, both pullulanase addition time and temperature adjustment greatly impacted the final maltose yield. These results indicated that an appropriate beta-amylolysis in the first stage (the first 8 h) was required to facilitate saccharification process, with the maltose yield of 8.46% greater than that of the single step saccharification. Molecular structure analysis further demonstrated that a relatively low temperature (50 °C), as compared with a normal temperature (60 °C), in the first stage resulted in a greater number of chains polymerized by at least seven glucose units and a less heterogeneity system within the residual substrate. The molecular structure of the residual substrate might be beneficial for the subsequent cooperation between beta-amylase and pullulanase in the following 40h (second stage). Conclusion. Over a 48 h saccharification, the temperature-mediated two-step process dramatically increased the conversion rate of maltodextrin and yielded significantly more maltose and less byproduct, as compared with a constant-temperature process. The two-step saccharification process therefore offered an efficient and green strategy for maltose syrup production in industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3742	3748	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11005					FSTA:2021-10-Aj13937

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cyclodextrin is widely used in the food industry due to its excellent physicochemical properties. Organic solvents are usually used as complexing agents in the enzymatic production of cyclodextrin. Because they form inclusion complexes with the cyclodextrin products, these solvents reduce product inhibition, change the product (alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins) ratio and increase the cyclodextrin yield. In this study, the effects of twenty five alcohols, including linear and branched-chain monohydric alcohols and diols, on the yield and cyclodextrin ratio were systematically investigated. The stability of the inclusion complexes formed were also measured and compared. Although almost all of the alcohols increased cyclodextrin yield and many increased alpha-cyclodextrin selectivity, the effects of linear monohydric alcohols on alpha-cyclodextrin synthesis were greater than those of the branched-chain monohydric alcohols and diols with similar numbers of carbon atoms. The linear alcohols also showed the best correlation between inclusion complex formation and increased alpha-cyclodextrin selectivity. This study provides a theoretical basis for the selection of compound agents in producing alpha-cyclodextrin.

Analytical determination of the severity of potato taste defect in roasted east African Arabica coffee.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The quality of East African coffee beans has been significantly reduced by a flavor defect known as potato taste defect (PTD) due to the presence of 2-isopropyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IPMP) and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP). Therefore, the aims of this study were to determine the correlation between these methoxypyrazines and the severity of odor attributed to PTD and discover additional analytes that may be correlated with PTD using Fisher ratio analysis, a supervised discovery-based data analysis method. Specialty ground roasted coffees from East Africa were classified as clean (i.e., no off-odor), mild, medium, or strong PTD. For the samples examined, IPMP was found to discriminate between non-defective and defective samples, while IBMP did not do so. Samples affected by PTD exhibited a wide range of IPMP concentration (1.6-529.9 ng/g). Except for one sample, the IPMP concentration in defective samples was greater than the average IPMP concentration in the non-defective samples (2.0 ng/g). Also, an analysis of variance found that IPMP concentrations were significantly different based on the severity of odor attributed to PTD (p < 0.05). Fisher ratio analysis discovered 21 additional analytes whose concentrations were statistically different based on the severity of PTD odor (p < 0.05). Generally, analytes that were positively correlated with odor severity generally had unpleasant sensory descriptions, while analytes typically associated with desirable aromas were found to be negatively correlated with odor severity. These findings not only show that IPMP concentration can differentiate the severity of PTD but also that changes in the volatile analyte profile of coffee beans induced by PTD can contribute to odor severity.

J		Caiping Huang; Bangzhu Peng							Photocatalytic degradation of patulin in apple juice based on nitrogen-doped chitosan-TiO2 nanocomposite prepared by a new approach.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A high-performance nitrogen-doped chitosan-TiO2 nanocomposite to be used as a photocatalyst for patulin degradation in apple juice was successfully prepared by a simple precipitation method. The structure and properties were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), and UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectrum. According to XPS and UV-Vis analyses, nitrogen had been successfully doped into the TiO2 nanoparticle crystals and reduced the band gap energy of TiO2 nanoparticles. The synthesized nanocomposite was able to photocatalytically degrade the patulin in apple juice under ultraviolet irradiation. The patulin (500 mug/kg) was completely degraded within 35 min, which exhibited significantly enhanced photocatalytic activities compared with TiO2 nanoparticles or chitosan-TiO2 nanocomposite. Moreover, the photocatalytic treatment significantly reduced the occurrence of juice browning, and had little effects on reducing sugar, pH, titratable acid and soluble solids of the apple juice. The nitrogen-doped chitosan-TiO2 nanocomposite would be an ideal photocatalyst for patulin degradation in apple juice due to its high photocatalytic activity and little effects on the quality of apple juice.

Effect of storage conditions on the quality of arbequina extra virgin olive oil and the impact on the composition of flavor-related compounds (phenols and volatiles).		Foods					Commercialization of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) requires a best before date recommended at up to 24 months after bottling, stored under specific conditions. Thus, it is expected that the product retains its chemical properties and preserves its "extra virgin" category. However, inadequate storage conditions could alter the properties of EVOO. In this study, Arbequina EVOO was exposed to five storage conditions for up to one year to study the effects on the quality of the oil and the compounds responsible for flavor. Every 15 or 30 days, samples from each storage condition were analyzed, determining physicochemical parameters, the profiles of phenols, volatile compounds, alpha-tocopherol, and antioxidant capacity. Principal component analysis was utilized to better elucidate the relationships between the composition of EVOOs and the storage conditions. EVOOs stored at -23 and 23°C in darkness and 23°C with light, differed from the oils stored at 30 and 40°C in darkness. The former was associated with a higher quantity of non-oxidized phenolic compounds and the latter with higher elenolic acid, oxidized oleuropein, and ligstroside derivatives, which also increased with storage time. (E)-2-nonenal (detected at trace levels in fresh oil) was selected as a marker of the degradation of Arbequina EVOO quality over time, with significant linear regressions identified for the storage conditions at 30 and 40°C. Therefore, early oxidation in EVOO could be monitored by measuring (E)-2-nonenal levels. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Effect of sucrose replacement and resistant starch addition on textural properties of gluten-free doughs and biscuits.		European Food Research and Technology					There is a need to develop low-sugar healthy products. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of maltitol and inulin as sucrose replacement alongside resistant starch (RS) and green banana flour (GBF) on the texture and physical properties of gluten-free doughs and biscuits formulated with buckwheat, sorghum and lentil flours. These properties are important to predict the dough workability, how easy the biscuits could be mass-produced and determine consumers' acceptability. Results showed that partial and complete substitution of sucrose could be achieved and appropriate concentration of resistant starch or green banana flour contributed to better dough and biscuit texture. RS content showed the biggest influence on dough stickiness and biscuit hardness and could be used to correct the negative effect of sucrose replacement and to maximise both the dough processability and biscuit acceptability. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	247	3	707	718	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-020-03659-w					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3495

Use of underexploited flours for the reduction of glycaemic index of gluten-free biscuits: physicochemical and sensory characterization.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The type and the amount of starch present in bakery products affect their glycaemic index. The control of glycaemic index in our diet can be relevant to reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart diseases. The use of alternative flours to rice, maize, and their starches may improve the nutritional quality of gluten-free baked goods by reducing the glycaemic index. This work aimed at the formulation of satisfactory gluten-free biscuits by using underexploited flour mixes (from cereals, pseudocereals, and legumes), at the evaluation of their physical properties, starch digestibility and subsequent estimation of the glycaemic index. The presence of chickpea flour increased biscuit hardness and gluten-free flours darkened biscuit surface. The greatest differences in starch composition and its digestion were found between gluten-free samples and wheat-containing control. Experimental biscuits had also a lower predicted glycaemic index compared to commercial products, whereas experimental formulations presented similar values between each other. Consumers' acceptance and sensory profiling by Check All That Apply questionnaire were carried out. All formulations but one were above the acceptance threshold (50); crumbliness and easiness to swallow were drivers of acceptance, whereas sandiness exerted a negative impact on liking score. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	14	8	1490	1502	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02650-x					FSTA:2021-11-Mq6935
J		Cairone, F.; Petralito, S.; Scipione, L.; Cesa, S.							Study on extra virgin olive oil: quality evaluation by anti-radical activity, color analysis, and polyphenolic HPLC-DAD analysis.		Foods					This study aimed to evaluate the quality of oils available on the Italian market and purchased directly from the mill or in the supermarket and labelled as extra virgin olive oils (EVOOs). As one of the most relevant foods of the Mediterranean diet and recognized as a functional food if regularly consumed, the quality of EVOO needs to be continuously monitored. Different analytical protocols were applied. The spectrophotometric parameters used to classify the extra virgin olive oils-a CIEL*a*b*color analysis and the quali-quantitative analysis of bioactive molecules by HPLC-DAD detection and the anti-radical activity, by the DPPH method, were evaluated and compared among the samples. This study confirmed a very high variation in terms of quality, both in oils purchased directly from mills throughout Italy, but also in oils labeled as "100% of Italian origin". Due to the high variability reconfirmed in the monitored samples, it is necessary to carry out a capillary control, not limited only to the parameters indexed by law. A useful complementary method could be represented by reflectance colorimetric analysis. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cais-Sokolinska, D.; Walkowiak-Tomczak, D.							Consumer-perception, nutritional, and functional studies of a yogurt with restructured elderberry juice.		Journal of Dairy Science					We investigated the effects of supplementation of yogurt with elderberry juice (Sambucus nigra L.), in both natural and restructured forms, on certain technological, physicochemical, sensory, and health-promoting properties of yogurt, including antioxidant activity and inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase activity. Consumer acceptance of the yogurt-juice products was assessed. Gel-strength restructured elderberry juice retained a spherical shape and most of the juice, despite decreasing in mass from 57.2 to 50.9 g during storage. As a result, yogurt supplemented with 10 and 25% restructured elderberry juice appeared to be more desirable from a sensory and technological perspective than yogurt with natural juice. Yogurt supplemented with restructured elderberry juice had a high water-holding capacity (94.4-96.4%), exhibited no spontaneous whey syneresis, and maintained a dense consistency (up to 5,626 g). Consumer penalty analysis of the just-about-right diagnostic attributes indicated that the flavor of these yogurts may not be sufficiently refreshing. High correlation was demonstrated between ACE inhibition, ABTS, alpha-amylase, and alpha-glucosidase in yogurt supplemented with restructured juice. An in vitro gastrointestinal simulation estimated bioaccessibility of antioxidants to be in the range of 62 to 66%. This model fermented yogurt supplemented with restructured elderberry juice is a novel dairy-juice beverage that represents a new approach for the development of functional fruit yogurt beverages.

J		Caissie, A. F.; Riquier, L.; Revel, G. de; Tempere, S.							Representational and sensory cues as drivers of individual differences in expert quality assessment of red wines.		Food Quality and Preference					The aim of this study was to model decisional consensus in expert red wine tastings, using an integrated competency framework. Wine assessment responses on both technical and emotional scales were collated for two wine categories (Premium vs. Secondary) under several different sensory conditions: six global tastings (all senses involved), three unimodal tastings (visual, smell, and taste), and three bimodal tastings (visual-smell, visual-taste, and taste-smell). Psychological predictors also included vocabulary and vividness of mental imagery associated with the various senses involved, together with professional experience indicators (age and tasting frequency). Principal component analyses revealed a greater response consensus with unimodal vision cues compared to all other sensory conditions (at least equal to global conditions). On average, a greater consensus was observed among technical quality scale responses under all sensory conditions, compared to emotional scale responses. The quality responses were used to build a 4-factor prediction model: age, wine imagery, vocabulary, and smell consensus. The image responses were used to build a two-factor prediction model: visual words (semantic knowledge) and visual-smell consensus. This indicated that the quality decisional consensus was based on smell information (wine aroma), combined with longevity/knowledge. In contrast, the image decisional consensus was based on visual information (wine color), combined with visual knowledge (and smell as a subordinate factor). Taken together, our results revealed previously uncharted individual differences in wine tasting and decision-making, concomitant with similarly weighted predictions based on sensory and psychological factors.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Lipid degradation caused by lipolysis and oxidation plays an important role in the evolution of final product quality of cured silver carp. This study aimed to determine the impact of exogenous lipase (ExL) on lipolysis and lipid oxidation during the wet-curing and dry-ripening of silver carp inoculated with mixed starter cultures. The addition of ExL to silver carp increased the hydrolysis of total lipids and phospholipids. The free fatty acids (FFAs) content during wet-curing was significantly higher in the ExL-treated group compared with the control. Increased FFA accumulation contributed to a high level of conjugated dienes, peroxides and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in the ExL-treated group, indicating that the lipid oxidation was improved by the addition of ExL. Increased neutral lipase, acid lipase and phospholipase activities during the wet-curing stage might explain the more extensive release of FFAs in the presence of ExL. The addition of ExL promotes the hydrolysis and oxidation of lipids in cured silver carp. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	9	4568	4575	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15275					FSTA:2022-01-Rc0204

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this work, the adoption of n-octadecylamine (ODA) functionalized magnetic carbon nanotube porous nanocomposite (M-CNTs/ODA) as cleanup agents for a modified QuEChERS method to detect pesticide residues was investigated for the first time. The properties and morphology of the M-CNTs/ODA were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, vibrating sample magnetometer and X-ray diffraction. The results confirmed that M-CNTs/ODA had an excellent ability to remove matrix interferences and reduce matrix effects compared with traditional cleanup agents. The recoveries ranged from 81.3%-96.1%, the relative standard deviations (RSDs) varied from 1.98% to 6.89% (n=3), the limits of detection (S/N=3) of the method for the compounds were between 0.009-0.050 mg/L in real samples. Satisfactory results were also obtained for the detection of 16 pesticides in vegetables and fruits. As a promising cleanup material, the porous M-CNTs/ODA has future application potential in detecting other organic pollutants in different samples.

Food & Function					Globally, the incidence of hyperuricaemia is steadily increasing. The evidence increasingly suggests an association between hyperuricaemia and the gut microbiota, which may enable the development of a novel therapeutic approach. We studied the effects of treatment with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) on hyperuricaemia and their potential underlying mechanisms. A mouse model of hyperuricaemia was generated by oral gavage with hypoxanthine and intraperitoneal injections of potassium oxonate for 2 weeks. The anti-hyperuricaemic activities of 10 LAB strains relative to allopurinol as a positive drug control were investigated in the mouse model. Lactobacillus rhamnosus R31, L. rhamnosus R28-1 and L. reuteri L20M3 effectively reduced the uric acid (UA) concentrations in serum and urine and the xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity levels in serum and hepatic tissue in mice with hyperuricaemia. These strains also reversed the elevated lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentration, hepatic inflammation and slight renal injury associated with hyperuricaemia. A correlation analysis revealed that UA-reducing LAB strains promoted short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production to suppress serum and hepatic XOD activity by increasing the abundances of SCFA production-related gut bacterial taxa. However, the UA-reducing effects of LAB strains might not be mediated by purine degradation. In summary, L. rhamnosus R31, L. rhamnosus R28-1 and L. reuteri L20M3 relieved hyperuricaemia in our mouse model by promoting SCFA production in a purine degradation-independent manner. Our findings suggest a novel therapeutic approach involving LAB strains for hyperuricaemia. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	15	7054	7067	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00198a					FSTA:2021-12-Aj17326

Food Chemistry					Fresh green peas require blanching to terminate enzymatic reaction induced quality deterioration before frozen storage. Radio frequency (RF) heating is a novel way of dry blanching for fruits and vegetables with high processing efficiency. In this study, blanching effects of RF heating on relative activities of lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POD), physiochemical properties as well as cellular morphology changes of green peas were investigated. Results. Showed relative activities of pea LOX and POD reduced to 0.900.78% and 1.100.71%, respectively at 85 °C by RF heating with an electrode gap 105 mm. Weight loss, color, texture and electrolyte leakage of peas changed significantly with increasing temperature (60-85 °C). Ascorbic acid, chlorophyll and mineral contents had different loss after RF processing and long term heating at 115 mm exacerbated the loss of nutrients. Microstructure features showed the deconstruction of pea cell well and starch granule gelatinization.

Journal of Medicinal Food					Polygonatum sibiricum (PS) has been used as herbal medicine to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, how lactic acid fermentation of PS influences glucose and lipid metabolism remains unclear. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of PS fermented with Lactobacillus brevis YM 1301 (YM 1301) in streptozotocin and high-fat diet-induced T2DM mice. Biochemical analysis revealed that supplementation with metformin, PS, or fermented Polygonatum sibiricum (FPS) lowered the fasting blood glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol of diabetic mice. FPS showed relatively more potency to reduce the homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance and glycated hemoglobin than PS. Moreover, a high dosage of FPS protected against glucose intolerance and insulin resistance by increasing the ratio of phosphor-AKT/AKT. Histological examination and quantitative polymerase chain reaction results showed that dietary FPS ameliorated the lipid accumulation in liver and white adipose tissue (WAT) by inhibiting lipogenesis, enhancing lipolysis, and fatty acid oxidation. FPS exhibited greater efficacy than PS on improving the transcriptional expression of adipose triacylglyceride lipase, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, and uncoupling protein 1. In addition, FPS exerted a striking anti-inflammatory effect by suppressing the expression of interleukin 6, interleukin 1beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and transforming growth factor-beta in WAT of diabetic C57BL/6 mice. Finally, FPS supplementation enhanced the activation of AMPK. In conclusion, these results suggest that the FPS may be more promising than PS as a potential therapeutic agent for diabetes and obesity.										2021	24	7	720	731	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2021.K.0034					FSTA:2022-01-Ge0411

Food and Bioproducts Processing					The effects of pulsed electric field (PEF) treatment and preliminary vacuum drying (VD) on freezing assisted processes for the potato tissue were studied. The PEF treatment was done at 600 V/cm using the protocol to insure the high level of potato disintegration. The VD was done at sub-atmospheric pressure of p=0.30 bar. Such conditions allowed relatively fast dehydration accelerated by PEF treatment at low or moderate temperatures inside sample (<50 °C). Impacts of PEF and VD on freeze-thawing (FT) and freeze-drying (FD) processes were tested. The duration of the freezing and thawing processes noticeably increased with increasing of the moisture ratio. The PEF treatment also accelerated the FD and affected the final level of dehydration after prolonged FD for 24 h. It was demonstrated that application of VD and VD combined with FT deteriorated the rehydration, whereas VD combined with FD facilitated the rehydration of deeply dried potato tissue. The obtained regularities can be useful in future practical implementations of freezing assisted processes with fine control of deterioration of product quality and reduced operating and maintenance costs.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this paper, valorisation of pumpkin oil cake as source of new protein carrier material for encapsulation was examined in order to enrich real food products. Cookies were used as a model system for addition of encapsulates at three different levels: 10%, 15% and 20%. The physicochemical and sensory properties were investigated, as well as conditions of stability after storage, in terms of total phenolic and betalain content. Furthermore, antioxidant, alpha-glucosidase and ACE inhibitory potential of cookies was evaluated after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. The cookies showed good technological quality as well as acceptable sensorial properties. The addition of encapsulate increases the total phenolic and betalain contents and shoved significant stability during storage time. Novel peptides were produced after gastrointestinal digestion, which enhanced bioactive properties of enriched products through synergistic action with active compounds from beetroot juice. Obtained digest shoved significant antioxidant, antidiabetic and antihypertension activities, hence ensuring a potential healing effect that could be reached by consuming these cookies. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	7	3400	3408	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14964					FSTA:2021-10-Mq6406

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of the present study was to investigate the microbial and technological characterization of barley-wheat flour (with 25%, 50%, 75% wheat flour added) breads made from hull-less barley sourdough that was prepared with a starter culture of Lb. plantarum SAB15, Lb. brevis SAB31 and S. cerevisiae SAM1-4. The yeasts isolated from spontaneous hull-less sourdough were sequenced with 26S rRNA gene via identification of the dominant species of S. cerevisiae with FTIR. Hull-less barley, with 13.6% protein, 1.47% ash, 66.15% water absorption and 21 ml sedimentation value, was added to wheat flour and protein, water absorption, and ash values decreased while sedimentation values increased. Hull-less barley-wheat bread samples containing starter culture was obtained with higher volume, specific volume and lower hardness than breads containing spontaneous culture. Especially breads with 25% and 50% barley mix were found to be the best ratios for hull-less barley bread. Although bread containing 75% and 100% barley flour scored low, those containing starter culture scored positively in terms of hardness and chewiness, and were accepted by consumers. With more barley added, there was higher a* and lower b* in the bread, while the breads with starter culture were found to be less yellow and red.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Wheat milling by-products (germ and bran) are rich in dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. In this study, wheat milling by-products (bran obtained by debranning (BOD), coarse bran, fine bran and wheat germ) were used in the production of cake at different ratios (0-30%) after treatment with xylanase. Xylanase was used to improve the technological properties of the by-products and thus improve end-product quality. Results. As the by-products ratio increased in cake formulation, ash, protein, fat, crude fiber, phytic acid and mineral content significantly (P<0.05) increased. In terms of by-product type, phytic acid content of the cakes changed between 1.14 and 2.55gkg-1, and the lowest value was obtained in cakes prepared with BOD. The highest protein, Mn and Zn contents were found in cake samples containing wheat germ, whereas the addition of BOD revealed greater crude fiber, Ca and Fe levels in cake samples than the other by-products. Xylanase treatment resulted in increments in volume and decrements in hardness and color lightness values of cakes. Conclusion. This study demonstrated that the use of the wheat by-products after treatment with xylanase had an improving effect on the quality and nutritive value of cakes. The results obtained in this study provided a basis for the use of xylanase in enriched cake production. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Cakmak, H.; Mama, M.; Yilmaz, S. M.							Determination of the effects of flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) sprouts powder on the gluten-free cupcake quality.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, germinated flaxseed sprouts powder (FSP) as plant-based gum alternative was produced and the effectiveness in gluten-free cupcake formulation at different levels was evaluated. The cupcake quality with FSP was compared with xanthan gum including cupcakes and the commercial gluten-free flour by analyzing the proximate composition, bake loss, specific volume, porosity, crumb, and crust color. Besides, results of texture profile analysis and SEM images were discussed based on the gum source used. Xanthan gum (XG) and FSP addition significantly increased the specific volume compared to the control (p<.05). Also, increasing the amount of XG or FSP resulted in higher specific volume and porosity, but the effect of FSP was more pronounced. The lowest hardness was observed for the 2% FSP, while the highest was obtained for 2% XG (p<.05). The number of air holes visible in SEM images was higher in cupcakes with FSP compared to 2% XG. Practical applications. Gluten-free products are essential for individuals having celiac disease or gluten-related disorders since they need to follow a strict gluten-free diet. But because of gluten absence in the formulations especially for bakery products, gluten-free product formulations are developed by trial and error tests. Especially gums, emulsifiers, and other stabilizers are required for giving a better texture and improving other sensorial properties of final product. Commercial gums like xanthan gum, guar gum, or gum Arabic are used individually or as a mixture and they are readily available on the market. However, gluten-free product consumers always demand for new ingredients and product formulations, and plant-based ingredients particularly attracts more attention because of their compatibility with diets for special needs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Investigation of some biochemical parameters of wild and cultured Myrtus communis L. fruits subjected to different conservation methods.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, wild and cultivated white Myrtus communis L. ("myrtle") fruits were investigated for their vitamin levels (A, B, C and E), carotenes (lycopene, beta-carotene), functional peptides (glutathione, ghrelin), oxidative stress markers (GSSG and MDA), total phenolic and flavonoid substances, antioxidant capacity (DPPH, TEAC) and essential elements (Se, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn). The results showed that both myrtle fruits can be considered as the good source of vitamins, antioxidants and elements. The preservation (sun or microwave-drying) methods for this seasonal fruit caused a significant (p<0.05) decrease in their biochemical and bio-pharmacological content compared to fresh or frozen fruits. On the contrary, preservation resulted a significant increase in GSSG and MDA levels. The amounts of Se, Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn in wild myrtle fruit were found as 0.58, 205, 228.0, 37.22 and 24.3 g/g dw, respectively. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Cakmak, Z. H. T.; Cakmakoglu, S. K.; Avci, E., sr; Sagdic, O.; Karasu, S.							Ultrasound-assisted vacuum drying as alternative drying method to increase drying rate and bioactive compounds retention of raspberry.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to determine the effect of different drying methods, namely hot air drying (HAD), vacuum drying (VD), ultrasound-assisted vacuum drying (USVD), and freeze drying (FD) on drying kinetic, total phenolic antioxidant activity, anthocyanin profile, in vitro-bioaccessibility of phenolic and color quality of raspberry samples. The drying time of the raspberry was 540,720, and 1,140 min for USVD, VD, and HAD, respectively, indicating that USVD showed a significantly lower drying time than VD and HAD. The results of anthocyanin profile, TPC, CUPRAC, and DPPH analysis showed that FD had higher bioactive compound retention than other methods, followed by USVD. Cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside and Cyanidin 3-O-glucoside were found as the most abundant anthocyanin in raspberry samples. In the content of cyanidin 3-O-sophoroside, a loss of 78.33%, 15.41%, and 4.63% was observed in HAD, VD, and USVD, respectively. In vitro bioaccessibility of the VD and USVD were higher than FD and HAD. While the recovery value of TPC (%) was found for fresh raspberry as 3.09%, it was found as 6.79, 9.42, 8.46, and 5.58% for HAD, VD, USVD, and FD, respectively. Color quality was significantly affected by drying methods (p<.05), and USVD showed the lowest DeltaE value. SEM analysis showed that less shrinkage and cell damage were observed in FD-and USVD-dried samples. This study suggested that USVD could be used as an alternative drying method since it showed lower drying time and shrinkage, higher bioactive compounds, and color retention than VD and HAD. Practical application. Raspberry is a popularly consumed fruit rich in bioactive compounds such as anthocyanin and vitamin C. Raspberry is a fruit with a low shelf life, sensitive to microorganisms and enzyme activities due to its high nutritional content and water activity. Drying is one of the most widely used methods to increase the shelf life of raspberries. It is crucial to find a suitable drying method because the bioactive components, color, and physical structure may change during drying. In this study, the effects of four drying methods on the total bioactive components, anthocyanin profile, microstructural structure, color, and phenolic antioxidant in vitro bioaccessibility of raspberry fruit were investigated. The study contains original data. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Calabrese, V.; Gunes, D. Z.; Farres, I. F.							Rheological control of pea fibre dispersions in oil: the role of particle and water volume fractions.		Food Hydrocolloids					Two distinct coarse fractions of the yellow pea, namely the pea hull (PH) and the epidermal cell wall (PCW), are investigated as rheological modifiers of an oil phase. We considered two avenues for oil structuring: (i) the increase in particle volume fraction (phi) and (ii) the addition of water to a PH and PCW-in-oil dispersion at a constant phi = 0.10. The PH and PCW-in-oil dispersions exhibited a viscosity increase as a function of the particle volume fraction, which was well captured by the Krieger-Dougherty relationship. At values close to the maximum volume fraction (phi 0.50) the PH and PCW-in-oil dispersions displayed a paste-like appearance with solid-like properties. The water addition to the PH and PCW-in-oil dispersion caused a noteworthy increase in viscosity and the development of pronounced elasticity due to the water bridges connecting neighbouring particles, rising capillary forces.

J		Calam, T. T.							A modified pencil graphite electrode with 2-thiobarbituric acid for the efficient and cheap voltammetric sensing of 4-aminophenol in water samples and child syrup sample.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, a sensor (2-TBA/PGE) for the sensitive, selective, cheap and rapid determination of 4-aminophenol (4AP) was easily prepared by depositing with 2-thiobarbituric acid (2-TBA) on a pencil graphite electrode (PGE) surface. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) methods as the electrochemical methods were used to characterize 2-TBA/PGE with using redox probe. The effective electroactive surface area of PGE (bare PGE, 0.030 cm2) increased about 6 times by coating with 2-TBA film on PGE (2-TBA/PGE, 0.174 cm2). This case caused that modified electrode exhibited a remarkable increment in the peak current of redox probe. Also, the sensor was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) was used to investigate the coupling sites of 2-TBA film and PGE surface. The oxidation peak current of 4AP on 2-TBA/PGE increased at about 6.81 times compared with the bare PGE. Under the optimized conditions, the anodic peak currents of 4AP were increased linearly with three concentration intervals of 4AP by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) technique. These intervals were found as 90 nM-0.5 muM, 0.5-9.46 muM and 9.46-423 muM. The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated as 21 nM. The determination of spiked 4AP in tap water, lake water and a child syrup containing paracetamol was successfully performed using the proposed method. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Caldeira, A. J. R.; Alves, C. P. P.; Santos, M. J.							Anisakis notification in fish: an assessment of the cases reported in the European Union rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) database.		Food Control					The presence of Anisakis spp. in fishery products are of enormous relevance to consumers, food security authorities and the fishing and food industries, because of the associated disease and possible loss of commercial value. Moreover, due to the great increase in the consumption of raw or undercooked fish, this study evaluated the notification of Anisakis reported on the RASFF portal from 1979 to 2019. The results show that although the first notification to Anisakis appeared in 2001, the highest number of cases occurred between 2011 and 2019. The 546 notifications to Anisakis were carried out by 13 different European Union countries. Italy, in addition to report the largest number of cases, was the only country to report every year. The higher notifications cases are for Spanish products. The main notified fish were: Mackerel, Hake and Anglerfish. The main type of notification was "border rejection" (25.28%), followed by "alert" (23.81%). Most of the "notification bases", consisted of "official control on the market" (56.78%). The main measures taken for Anisakis' notifications were "destruction" (27.5%) and "withdrawal from the market" (17.8%). As for the distribution status, it was observed that the majority was "no distribution" (22.71%) or "distribution on the market possible" (21.06%). Regarding the risk decision, the vast majority of cases were considered "undecided". Despite presenting some gaps, the RASFF portal represents a useful tool in obtaining information on trends in notification of Anisakis occurring in fish. The significant increase in notifications to Anisakis in recent years, reinforces the need for a standardization of the methodologies for detecting parasites, using more modern techniques. Consumers play an important role in the fishing chain, and it is necessary to promote continuing education, so that citizens can become an active part in the management of the risks related to fish intake associated with Anisakis larvae.

Bioguided chemical characterization of pequi (Caryocar brasiliense) fruit peels towards an anti-diabetic activity.		Food Chemistry					Pequi fruit peels are an underexploited source of polyphenols. The anti-diabetic potential of an extract and fractions from the peels were evaluated in a panel of assays. The extract and fractions thereof inhibited the release of cytokines involved in insulin resistance-TNF, IL-1beta, and CCL2-by lipopolysaccharide-stimulated THP-1 cells. The ethyl acetate fraction inhibited in vitro alpha-glucosidase (pIC50=4.80.1), an enzyme involved in the metabolization of starch and disaccharides to glucose, whereas a fraction enriched in tannins (16C) induced a more potent alpha-glucosidase inhibition (pIC50=5.30.1). In the starch tolerance test in mice, fraction 16C reduced blood glucose level (18110 mg/dL) in comparison to the vehicle-treated group (23811 mg/dL). UPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analyses disclosed phenolic acids and tannins as constituents, including corilagin and geraniin. These results highlight the potential of pequi fruit peels for developing functional foods to manage type-2 diabetes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Simultaneous quantification of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol in beer by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry.		Food Chemistry					An analytical method for the simultaneous determination of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol in beer was developed and validated according to current legislation. This method includes the application of sample dilution with ethanol followed by quantification using gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. All figures of merit were within the limits established by regulation. The recoveries of the analytes, expressed As mean recovery, were between 91.9% and 108.9%. Precision, in terms of repeatability and intermediate precision, was established (relative standard deviations were lower than or equal to 10%). The limits of detection (10.0 and 5.0 mg. L-1 for ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol, respectively) and quantification (15.0 mg. L-1 for ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol) obtained were appropriate. Finally, the present method was applied for determination of ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol in 701 beer samples (from 67 different brands and 128 different labels), proving to be reliable.

Herbs and herbal infusions: determination of natural contaminants (mycotoxins and trace elements) and evaluation of their exposure.		Food Research International					Herbal infusions are amongst the world's most popular and widely enjoyed beverages, due to both large variety and convenience. However, natural contaminants, such as mycotoxins and trace elements can accumulate in aromatic herbs, which may have serious food safety and public health implications. In this study, the presence of mycotoxins, as well as the content of trace elements was evaluated in herbs and herbal infusions commercialized in Brazil. For the determination of fourteen mycotoxins, including the emerging mycotoxins enniatins (EN), beauvericin (BEA), and sterigmatocystin (STE), a liquid-chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was validated. Overall, 42 out of 58 herb samples (72%) were contaminated, being BEA the most usual mycotoxin, present in 43% of the samples, followed by STE and HT-2 toxin, present in 37% and 24% of the samples, respectively. In herbal infusions, the occurrence of mycotoxins was 88% lesser than those verified in raw products. Despite these low levels, the hazard quotient (HQ) calculated revealed a potential health concern for HT-2 in infusions. The margin of exposure values for aflatoxins (AF), and ochratoxin A (OTA) from six herbal infusions were below 10,000, indicating also potential health risks. The twenty-one trace elements comprising toxic elements such as arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were determined in herb raw materials by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The levels of trace elements in herbs were very varied, with aluminum (Al) presenting the highest amount. The levels of legislated elements (As, Cd, Pb) analyzed in herbs were lower than 3.03 g g-1 (Pb), thus not exceeding the legal limits defined for herbal medicinal by both European and Brazilian pharmacopeia.

Jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam) leaf as a new source to obtain protein hydrolysates: physicochemical characterization, techno-functional properties and antioxidant capacity.		Food Hydrocolloids					Physicochemical, techno-functional properties and antioxidant capacity of Jackfruit leaf protein concentrate (LPC). And its hydrolysates were evaluated. LPC was obtained using the isoelectric precipitation method assisted by high hydrostatic pressure. LPC and its hydrolysates with pepsin (H-Pep) and pancreatin (H-Pan) at different interval times were characterised by colour, foaming and emulsifying properties. The antioxidant capacity through in vitro tests, such as DPPH+ and ABTS+ radical scavenging activity was also evaluated. The degree of hydrolysis (DH) for H-Pep and H-Pan ranged from 1.78 to 3.44 to 6.12-9.21%. The enzymatic hydrolysis significantly increased (p < 0.05) the L* value of all the hydrolysates concerning the LPC. However, the H-Pep presented lower DeltaE (p < 0.05) regarding the H-Pan, this could be related to the high L* values presented in the samples. The solubility of the hydrolysates was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than the LPC in all the tested pH (2.0-10.0) values (except for H-Pep at pH 10.0), reaching solubility values of 19-41 and 60-98% from pH 4.0 to 10.0 for H-Pep and H-Pan, respectively. The increase of solubility was associated with high emulsifying and foaming properties compared with LPC. The best emulsifying and foaming properties were presented at 180 and 60 min of H-Pan, respectively. The antioxidant capacity revealed that the H-Pan at 120 min of proteolysis exhibited high antioxidant properties. The values for DPPH+ and ABTS+ were 72.38% at 0.1 mg/mL and 98.20% at 0.8 mg/mL, respectively. The results suggest that type of enzyme and hydrolysis time determined the physicochemical, techno-functional properties, and antioxidant capacity of hydrolysates. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Interplay between dietary phenolic compound intake and the human gut microbiome in hypertension: a cross-sectional study.		Food Chemistry					In the present study, potential associations between dietary phenolic compounds (PCs), gut microbiota composition and targeted faecal metabolites were identified in a cross-sectional study including grade 1 hypertensive (HT) and normotensive (NT) subjects. We performed comprehensive quantification of PC intake, together with 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the gut microbiota, and faecal and plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) determination. The results showed multiple-way relationships between PCs from several plant-based foods and 25 bacterial taxa previously defined as discriminant biomarkers among groups. Remarkably, coffee PCs were positively associated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, faecal SCFAs, Bacteroides plebeius and Bacteroides coprocola in HT and negatively associated with Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Christensenellaceae R-7 in NT. Olive fruit PCs were positively associated with Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Christensenellaceae R-7 and plasma SCFAs in NT. These interplays with discriminant bacterial taxa in HT and NT subjects highlight the potential role of specific PCs as gut microbiome modulators in either the pathogenesis or prevention of hypertension.

Optimum SFOD-DLLME conditions were achieved with 1-undecanol (500 L) as the extraction solvent, ethanol (1.5 mL) as the disperser solvent within 20 s extraction time. Limit of detection (LOD) was found as 0.1 M (0.2 g g-1) and enrichment factors ranged between 17.4 and 25.0. Calibration graphs showed good linearity with coefficients of determination higher than 0.9954 and relative standard deviations lower than 5.6%. The proposed method was efficiently applied to determine iodate in table salt samples with percentage relative recoveries ranging between 89.3 and 109.3%. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A new combined sensory-instrumental tool for pomegranate seed hardness determination.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Scanning electron microscopy was assayed and linked with previous data with respect to obtaining a new combined sensory-instrumental tool for pomegranate seed hardness determination. The present study aimed to develop an effective tool for the prediction of sensory properties via instrumental determinations. Results. Simple regression analysis determined a high correlation within descriptive seed hardness and thickness of the wall, as well as descriptive wood perception and thickness of the wall, with values of 0.71 in both cases. Multiple regression analysis improved correlations when (i) descriptive seed hardness correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.94); (ii) descriptive wood perception correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.79); (iii) descriptive seed hardness correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the seed wall (0.96); and (iv) descriptive wood perception correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the seed wall (0.82). The same trend was found when (i) seed hardness satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.92); (ii) wood perception satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and wood index (0.82); (iii) seed hardness satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the wall (0.99); and (iv) wood perception satisfaction degree correlated with instrumental seed hardness and thickness of the wall (0.99). Conclusion. Regarding mechanical properties, the results of the present study confirm that texture analysis and scanning electron microscopy are an effective tool for obtaining reliable information. This research led to establish an objective tool allowing prediction of the consumer acceptance of pomegranate cultivars worldwide. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

USANS and SANS investigations on the coagulation of commercial bovine milk: microstructures induced by calf and fungal rennet.		Food Hydrocolloids					Coagulation of milk is a fundamental process in the manufacture of dairy products. Under the enzymatic action of rennet, casein micelles form aggregates resulting in a fractal gel network. There are few studies of microstructures using scattering techniques resulting from rennet coagulation in commercial milk in its native state. Here we employ ultra-small angle neutron scattering (USANS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) covering the scattering q-vector range of 5*10-510-2Angstrom-1 and the fractal cylinder model to study fractal structures and sizes resulting from calf and fungal rennet-induced coagulation of commercial skim and whole milk. We report evidence of aggregation with fractal properties analogous to that of swollen, randomly-branched polymers. Calf rennet resulted in a larger fractal dimension in skim compared to whole milk. In milk coagulated by fungal M. miehei, the randomly-branched polymer-like structures had a slightly larger fractal dimension of 2.5 and the structural unit was smaller. These measurements provide an important foundation for continuing study of the structure of commercial cheese with scattering techniques.

J		Calle, A.; Fernandez, M.; Montoya, B.; Schmidt, M.; Thompson, J.							UV-C LED irradiation reduces Salmonella on chicken and food contact surfaces.		Foods					Ultraviolet (UV-C) light-emitting diode (LED) light at a wavelength of 250-280 nm was used to disinfect skinless chicken breast (CB), stainless steel (SS) and high-density polyethylene (HD) inoculated with Salmonella enterica. Irradiances of 2 mW/cm2 (50%) or 4 mW/cm2 (100%) were used to treat samples at different exposure times. Chicken samples had the lowest Salmonella reduction with 1.02 and 1.78 Log CFU/cm2 (p≤0.05) after 60 and 900 s, respectively at 50% irradiance. Higher reductions on CB were obtained with 100% illumination after 900 s (>3.0 Log CFU/cm2). Salmonella on SS was reduced by 1.97 and 3.48 Log CFU/cm2 after 60 s of treatment with 50% and 100% irradiance, respectively. HD showed a lower decrease of Salmonella, but still statistically significant (p≤0.05), with 1.25 and 1.77 Log CFU/cm2 destruction for 50 and 100% irradiance after 60 s, respectively. Longer exposure times of HD to UV-C yielded up to 99.999% (5.0 Log CFU/cm2) reduction of Salmonella with both irradiance levels. While UV-C LED treatment was found effective to control Salmonella on chicken and food contact surfaces, we propose three mechanisms contributing to reduced efficacy of disinfection: bacterial aggregation, harboring in food and work surface pores and light absorption by fluids associated with CB. © 2021 by the authors.

Schott to develop pastes foods: physico-chemical, functional and nutritional characterization.		Food Chemistry					The corms of cocoyams, specifically Colocasia esculenta (L.) Schott and Xanthosoma sagittifolium (L.) Schott are usually consumed as pastes. Nevertheless, the secondary corms, also named cormels, are not fully exploited. In this study, the chemical composition and functional properties of cormels from different botanical sources were evaluated, and the digestibility of the resulting pastes investigated. Colocasia spp. flour contained significantly higher protein (10.32% vs 9.65%), ash (5.65% vs 5.05%) and oxalates (0.32% vs 0.22%) content, and exhibited lower Amylab gel strength (773 g vs 1040 g) than Xanthosoma spp. flour. In the resulting pastes, micrographs revealed that starch gelatinization depended on cocoyam variety. Indeed, the very tight and closed microstructure of pastes containing Colocasia spp. flour led them to better stability during storage with lower syneresis. Lower protein digestibility was obtained in Colocasia spp. gels (67.56% vs 70.91%), but they showed faster (higher k) in vitro starch hydrolysis (0.0140 vs 0.0050) with lower estimated glycemic index (61.29 vs 65.84) than Xanthosoma spp. gels. The present findings offer ways to develop cocoyam based foods by using cormels, enhancing the applicability of cocoyams. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A methodology based on FT-IR data combined with random forest model to generate Spectralprints for the characterization of high-quality vinegars.		Foods					Sherry wine vinegar is a Spanish gourmet product under Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Before a vinegar can be labeled as Sherry vinegar, the product must meet certain requirements as established by its PDO, which, in this case, means that it has been produced following the traditional solera and criadera ageing system. The quality of the vinegar is determined by many factors such as the raw material, the acetification process or the aging system. For this reason, mainly producers, but also consumers, would benefit from the employment of effective analytical tools that allow precisely determining the origin and quality of vinegar. In the present study, a total of 48 Sherry vinegar samples manufactured from three different starting wines (Palomino Fino, Moscatel, and Pedro Ximenez wine) were analyzed by Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The spectroscopic data were combined with unsupervised exploratory techniques such as hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA), as well as other nonparametric supervised techniques, namely, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), for the characterization of the samples. The HCA and PCA results present a clear grouping trend of the vinegar samples according to their raw materials. SVM in combination with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) successfully classified 100% of the samples, according to the type of wine used for their production. The RF method allowed selecting the most important variables to develop the characteristic fingerprint ("spectralprint") of the vinegar samples according to their starting wine. Furthermore, the RF model reached 100% accuracy for both LOOCV and out-of-bag (OOB) sets. © 2021 by the authors.

Impact of antibiotic-induced depletion of gut microbiota and selenium supplementation on plasma selenoproteome and metal homeostasis in a mice model.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Selenium (Se) is a micronutrient involved in important health functions and it has been suggested to shape gut microbiota. Limited information on Se assimilation by gut microbes and the possible link with selenoproteins are available. For this purpose, conventional and gut microbiota-depleted BALB/c mice were fed a Se-supplemented diet. The absolute quantification of mice plasma selenoproteins was performed for the first time using heteroatom-tagged proteomics. The gut microbiota profile was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Se-supplementation modulated the concentration of the antioxidant glutathione peroxidase and the Se-transporter selenoalbumin as well as the metal homeostasis, being influenced by microbiota disruption, which suggests an intertwined mechanism. Se also modulated microbiota diversity and richness and increased the relative abundance of some health-relevant taxa (e.g., families Christensenellaceae, Ruminococcaceae, and Lactobacillus genus). This study demonstrated the potential beneficial effects of Se on gut microbiota, especially after antibiotic-treatment and the first associations between specific bacteria and plasma selenoproteins.

J		Calligaris, S.; Plazzotta, S.; Barba, L.; Manzocco, L.							Design of roll-in margarine analogous by partial drying of monoglyceride-structured emulsions.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					A novel process is proposed to turn soft gelled emulsions containing saturated monoglyceride (MG), sunflower oil, and water into a fat material with the typical water content (20 g/100 g) and rheological properties of roll-in margarine. A gentle drying procedure at 30 °C is proposed to allow partial water removal from the emulsions, without causing phase separation. Upon water removal, the soft emulsion, initially stabilized by a highly hydrated liquid crystalline lamellar phase of MG, converts into a high internal phase oil-water emulsion (HIPE) stabilized thanks to the presence of MG crystals around gelled oil particles, which are interconnected via polar groups of MG. HIPE at the highest MG content (13.7 g/100 g) shows rheological properties (G'=4.6*105 Pa, critical stress=634 Pa) comparable to those of commercial roll-in margarine and is successfully used in baking trials of puff pastry. Practical Applications. The last years have seen an increasing demand for strategies for the nutritional improvement of lipid-containing foods, due to the emerging health concern related to the consumption of unbalanced saturate/unsaturated fats. Moreover, sustainability issues have arisen due to the abundant use of tropical fats in foods. However, the unique technological and sensory properties of fats make this task very challenging, especially considering the production of laminated products requiring the use of plastic fat materials with peculiar rheological properties. The results obtained in this study are very promising, as they show that the novel fat can be used as an alternative to traditional laminating margarine. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	3			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000206					FSTA:2021-07-Nc1498

A prototype rapid dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) system can predict the CT composition of beef carcases.		Meat Science					The development of a novel rapid dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) system provides the opportunity to improve measurement of beef carcase composition. A prototype rapid DEXA system was built in a shipping container to scan 51 beef carcases selected for a wide range in weight and fatness. One side of each carcase was spray chilled and the other conventionally chilled overnight before being quartered for DEXA scanning and then being cut into 16 pieces for CT scanning to determine carcase composition. Spray chilling did not impact DEXA prediction of CT composition, with the DEXA system describing 89%, 95%, and 87% of the variation in beef carcase CT lean %, fat % and bone %, with a root mean square error of prediction of 2.31 lean %, 2.15 fat %, and 1.12 bone % units. These results demonstrate that the novel rapid DEXA system has excellent capacity to predict CT composition in beef carcases. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Cocoa nanoparticles to improve the physicochemical and functional properties of whey protein-based films to extend the shelf life of muffins.		Foods					A novel nanocomposite whey protein-based film with nanoemulsified cocoa liquor (CL) was prepared using one-stage microfluidization to evaluate the emulsion properties and the effect of CL on the film properties by response surface methodology (RSM). The results indicated that the number of cycles by microfluidization had a significant effect (p< 0.05) on the particle size and polydispersity of the nanoemulsion, with a polyphenol retention of approximately 83%. CL decreased the solubility (<21.87%) and water vapor permeability (WVP) (<1.57g mm h-1 m-2 kPa-1) of the film. FTIR analysis indicated that CL modified the secondary protein structure of the whey protein and decreased the mechanical properties of the film. These results demonstrate that applying the film as a coating is feasible and effective to improve the shelf life of bakery products with a high moisture content. This nanocomposite film is easy to produce and has potential applications in the food industry. © 2021 by the authors.

Mechanism of inhibition of a characterized polyphenol extract of purslane (Portulaca oleracea).		Food Chemistry					The market value of crustaceans depreciates during storage due to the appearance of melanosis caused by polyphenol oxidases. Sulfite derivatives are used as melanosis-inhibiting agents, but their unhealthy effects make it preferable to replace them with natural preservatives. In this work, a crude enzymatic extract from whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) was characterized and used to test the diphenol oxidase-inhibiting activity of polyphenol extracts of five underutilized halophyte plants, namely crystalline ice plant, seaside arrowgrass, purslane, sea fennel, and seashore aster. The extracts inhibited diphenol oxidase activity more efficiently than sodium sulfite. The purslane extract was rich in isoorientins, isovitexin, and apigenin, and showed the highest inhibiting effect, being this classified as mixed or non-competitive. Hydroxyl groups in the phenyl B ring could be responsible for the inhibitory activity of the extract. The polyphenol extracts tested in this work could be promising melanosis-inhibiting agents of interest for seafood industries. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					Consumers experience mainly positive emotions in response to food products, and the reason is that, for most individuals, eating and drinking is a pleasurable experience. On this premise, in light of the Theory of Positive Asymmetry, this study answers the following question: "What emotions prevail in beverage consumption? " A MANOVA test was developed comparing emotions associated with spirits (n=247), alcoholic beverages (n=560) and non-alcoholic beverages (n=254). The findings report that the positive asymmetry of emotions occurs in beverage consumption, regardless of the type of beverage product, since pleasant or positive emotions are primarily associated with beverages' consumption. The analysis suggests that individuals predominantly associate beverages with pleasant emotions, regardless of the type of beverage, while the level of alcohol content seems to be influencing the different emotions and affect. The research results provide valuable insights to help managers and marketers understand the choice and preference for different beverages. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Calvo-Porral, C.; Rivaroli, S.; Orosa-Gonzalez, J.							The influence of celebrity endorsement on food consumption behavior.		Foods					"Is consumer food behavior influenced by celebrity endorsement?". This question remains unsolved despite celebrities constantly recommending different products in their social media networks. Much of the literature on celebrity endorsement focuses on the characteristics of celebrities influencing consumers' behavior, but there is scarce research about how celebrity endorsements about food and food products influence consumers' behavior. In this context and based on the source credibility and source attractiveness models, as well as on the match-up theory, this study aims to examine whether consumers' food purchase intention and consumers' willingness to pay a premium price is influenced by celebrity endorsement. For this purpose, an empirical study is developed through Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) based on data gathered from 316 consumers who read celebrity recommendations. Findings report that consumers are most influenced in their food consumption behavior by the congruence between the celebrity endorsement and the product being recommended, and by the celebrity credibility. Interestingly, celebrity recommendations show a similar influencing pattern both for consumers' food purchase intention and consumers" willingness to pay a premium price for food. The major contribution of this research is to show that congruence is the main route by which celebrity endorsement influences food consumption behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Calzolari, D.; Rocchetti, G.; Lucini, L.; Amaducci, S.							The variety, terroir, and harvest types affect the yield and the phenolic and sterolic profiles of hemp seed oil.		Food Research International					In this work, considering the rising interest towards the exploitation of hemp seed oil in human nutrition, 45 hemp seeds from mono-variety fields were analyzed for their yield, oil content, in vitro antioxidant activity, followed by a comprehensive assessment of phenolic and sterolic composition. The results demonstrated that seed dimension is inversely correlated to total oil content, thus being a potential reference for quality assessment of seeds and for further improvement of hemp varieties. The UHPLC-QTOF metabolomic analysis revealed a large abundance of phytosterols, lower-molecular-weight phenolic acids, and lignanamides. Differences across varieties could be described, with Diana hemp seed oil having the highest cumulative abundance of phytochemicals, recording 6.04 mg/g. Overall, the in vitro antioxidant activity results indicated that hemp seed oil antioxidants have a low potential for preventing oil rancidity, with phenolic acids being the most active radical scavengers. Besides, in the group of Futura 75 samples cultivated across Italy, the type of harvesting affected the acidity value significantly as a consequence of mechanical harvest and post-harvest handling. Finally, multivariate statistics following untargeted metabolomic analysis showed that variety, geographical origin, and harvest-type were able to affect the phytochemical profiles with different incidences, with some phytochemicals proposed for the first time as potential discriminant markers.

Canonical discriminant analysis of the fatty acid profile of muscle to authenticate beef from grass-fed and other beef production systems: model development and validation.		Food Control					The potential of diet-induced differences in the fatty acid profile of muscle to discriminate beef from different feeding systems and its potential use as an authentication tool was investigated. Three canonical discriminant models were built and validated using the fatty acid profile of beef from animals fed solely on pasture or cereal-based concentrates for 11 months or on various pasture/grass silage/concentrate combinations, including concentrates enriched with plant oils. Results. Indicated that models could successfully discriminate between grass-, partially grass-and concentrate-fed beef (accuracy=99%) and between grass-fed beef and beef from animals supplemented with plant oils (accuracy=96%). The approach also showed potential for distinguishing between beef from exclusively pasture-fed cattle and beef from cattle fed on pasture preceded by a period on ensiled grass (accuracy=89%). Models were also applied to beef samples from 9 different countries. Of 97 international samples, including samples stated to be grass-fed, only 5% were incorrectly classified as Irish-grass-fed beef. These results suggested that the models captured traits in the fatty acid profile that are characteristic of Irish grass-fed beef and that this feature could be used for distinguishing Irish grass-fed beef from beef from other regions.

Food Chemistry					Leaf samples from five Brassicaceae species (Brassica carinata, Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Eruca vesicaria and Sinapis alba) were analyzed to determine their contents of glucosinolates and trace elements, and the bioaccessibility of these compounds. Considerable variability in the total contents and glucosinolate profiles was observed in the Brassicaceae species, with the total amounts ranging from 8.5 mol/g dw in Brassica oleracea to 32.9 mol/g dw in Sinapis alba. Bioaccessibilities of the predominant glucosinolates were moderate, ranging from 13.1% for glucoraphanin to 43.2% for gluconapin, which is particularly relevant as they have been implicated in a variety of anti-carcinogenic mechanisms. Trace element concentrations were: Se (28-160 g/Kg dw); Cr (0.31-4.03 g/g dw); Ni (0.19-1.53 g/g dw); Fe (8.6-18.8 g/g dw); Zn (20.8-41.5 g/g dw); Ca (6.2-15.2 mg/g dw). Brassicaceae leaves were also moderate dietary sources of Se, Ni, Zn and Ca. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Camargo, A. C.; Costa, E. A.; Fusieger, A.; Freitas, R. de.; Nero, L. A.; Carvalho, A. F. de							Microbial shifts through the ripening of the "Entre Serras" Minas artisanal cheese monitored by high-throughput sequencing.		Food Research International					Minas Gerais is a Brazilian state known as the largest cheese producer in Brazil. Minas Artisanal Cheese (MAC) is produced in different regions of this Brazilian state using raw cow milk to which a natural starter culture ("pingo") is added. "Entre Serras" is one of these regions, in which the MAC production had decreased (even stopped) for decades until recently, when artisanal cheeses production has been resurrected. Here, we aimed to gain insights on the bacterial diversity of "Entre Serras" MAC. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was used to assess the bacterial community in cheeses produced by four farms (A, B, C, and D) over 60 days of ripening. Overall, Lactococcus lactis was the predominant species found, regardless of the producer/farm. Enterococcus, Streptococcus, Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc genera were also prevalent in the samples microbiota and their levels varied according to the producer/farm. Cheeses produced by Farms A and B presented high contaminant levels (mainly Enterobacteriaceae and S. aureus), which may be attributed to poor hygiene during cheese production and/or herd health management. Chao1 indices varied significantly when the estimated species richness values of the producers/farms were compared (p < 0.05). A principal coordinate analysis also revealed distinct microbial communities for some farms (p < 0.001). However, no statistical significance was identified when samples were grouped by ripening time. Core microbiota analysis indicated that "Entre Serras" MAC microbiota includes not only LAB, but also spoilage and potentially pathogenic bacteria. We provide the first insights on the bacterial diversity of "Entre Serras" MAC, helping the understanding of the inter-regional microbiological diversity of the samples.

Biological activities of the protein hydrolysate obtained from two fishes common in the fisheries bycatch.		Food Chemistry					Shrimp trawling is an important socio-economic activity; however, the bycatch can be problematic to the environment. Thus, the present study investigated potential uses of the bycatch to generate value-added products. The biological activity of the protein hydrolysates obtained from the two most abundant fish species (Micropogonias furnieri and Paralonchurus brasiliensis) was evaluated. Muscle and skin samples of both species were hydrolyzed using two enzymes, Alcalase 2.4 L or Protamex. The in vitro antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals, DPPH, and sulfhydryl groups were analyzed. Cell viability, Western Blotting, Zymogram, and Real-time PCR analyses were performed. The results showed that the hydrolysates have antioxidant activity and no effect on cell viability at doses lower than 16 mg/mL. In addition, they can modulate extracellular remodelling and intracellular pathways related to cell adhesion. Thus, the hydrolysis of the fish bycatch allows the release of bioactive peptides with potential use in the food industry.

J		Camel Lagnika; Asad Riaz; Ning Jiang; Jiangfeng Song; Dajing Li; Chunquan Liu; Qiuyu Wei; Min Zhang							Effects of pretreatment and drying methods on the quality and stability of dried sweet potato slices during storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Effects of blanching, osmotic dehydration, and/or ultrasound combined with hot air (HAD), microwave vacuum (MVD), and freeze drying (FD) on the stability of quality attributes of sweet potatoes during 90 days of storage at room temperature were investigated. Pretreated sample prior to two-step drying (HAD-MVD) preserved sweet potato color better compared to unblanched and FD samples during storage. X-ray diffraction clearly showed that the amorphous structure observed with pretreated samples was mainly due to blanching responsible for the disorganization of the starch structure caused by temperature. Physical damage which takes place with blanching treatment in the granule structure and in particular at the level of the crystalline part such as the breaking of intermolecular bonds had a significant impact on a decrease in crystallinity. During 90 days of storage, samples that did not undergo pre-treatment showed a higher reduction in phenolic content about 75.99% whereas pretreated combined with HAD-MVD or FD showed a reduction of about 51.31% and 32.27%, respectively. The results demonstrated that MVD caused retention of total carotenoid content, while freeze-dried samples recorded the highest degradation during storage. Practical applications. Food storage stability addresses one of the foremost problems faced by food processors. Studies on changes in the quality of a food product as a function of time are important to ensure product compliances to food standards. Storage time and processing are the major factors affecting the rate of loss of quality and shelf life of dehydrated sweet potatoes. Recently, osmotic dehydration and/or ultrasound combined with microwave vacuum drying has attracted significant attention in food processing generally because of the recent consumers" trend toward functional foods and stability during storage. The results show that blanching, osmotic dehydration, and/or ultrasound combined with microwave vacuum drying is a potential technique for improving the retention of bioactive compound and stability of sweet potato slices during storage at room temperature. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15807					FSTA:2022-01-Jk0797

Toward a better understanding of perceptive interactions between volatile and nonvolatile compounds: the case of proanthocyanidic tannins and red wine fruity esters-methodological, sensory, and physicochemical approaches.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The impact of commercial proanthocyanidic tannins on fruity pool of esters, representing the fruitiness of Bordeaux red wines, was assessed in model solutions. It was shown that the presence of tannins in the matrix significantly attenuated perception of fruity notes (p = 0.013). Physicochemical analysis demonstrated that the presence of proanthocyanidic tannins in dilute alcohol solution resulted in a decrease in ester partition coefficients and thus in a decrease in ester contents in the headspace (p< 0.05). This fact highlighted the changes that may occur in wines at a pre-sensory level, prior to sensory evaluation. Finally, a new sensory tool was developed, consisting in an ISO glass containing two compartments separated by a glass wall, providing a way to compare perceived odors according to whether or not the components of the odor mixtures were actually mixed in solution (p< 0.001). This new tool was used to demonstrate the impact and the only implication of pre-sensory level in the consequences of physical mixture between proanthocyanidic tannins and esters on their odor perception.

Influence of buriti pulp (Mauritia Flexuosa L.) concentration on thermophysical properties and antioxidant capacity.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to determine the thermophysical properties and antioxidant capacity of buriti pulp with concentrations of 7, 9, 11, 13, and 15 °Brix. Total solids and moisture content were determined in an oven, and the specific mass was determined by the pycnometer method, while the specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity were obtained using the KD2 Pro thermal properties analyzer. The antioxidant capacity was determined by the 2,2′-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) methods. At high concentrations, total solids and specific mass increased while moisture content decreased, and the soluble solids concentration did not influence specific heat, thermal diffusivity, and thermal conductivity. The antioxidant capacity of buriti pulps ranged from 0.07 to 10.45 mumol Trolox/g sample for the ABTS method and from 293.77 to 411.46 mumol Trolox/g sample for the DPPH method.

J		Cameron, R. G.; Branca, E.; Dorado, C.; Yang Kim							Pectic hydrocolloids from steam-exploded lime pectin peel: effect of temperature and time on macromolecular and functional properties.		Food Science & Nutrition					Previously, we showed the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and intrinsic viscosity ([eta]) of pectic hydrocolloids recovered from steam-exploded citrus peel were low, suggesting fragmentation due to process temperature and/or time-at-temperature. We have tested this hypothesis on a commercial lime pectin peel, washed to remove soluble sugars and dried for stabilization, using a static steam explosion system. We examined temperatures of 120-150 °C at 1-3 min hold times. Galacturonic acid recovery and Mw ranged from 22% to 82% and 142-214 kDa, respectively. Recovery of most major pectic sugars increased concomitantly with galacturonic acid as temperature and time-at-temperature increased. [eta] ranged from 1.75 to 6.83 dl/g. The degree of methylesterification ranged from 66.5% to 72.1%. Tan (delta) (Loss modulus/Storage modulus; G/G′) values of sugar-acid gels for 120-140 °C treatments were <1.0. Ideal optimization analysis, where time, [eta], and percent recovery were maximized, identified processing conditions that favor either increased [eta] or percent recovery. The results presented here support our hypothesis that temperature and time-at-temperature affect Mw and [eta] of the recovered pectic hydrocolloids. These results also demonstrate that manipulating either temperature or time-at-temperature enables the production of structurally varied populations of pectic hydrocolloids. Based on optimization analysis, commercially viable values of [eta] can be obtained while recovering approximately 50% of the pectic hydrocolloids. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Camiletti, O. F.; Riveros, C. G.; Aguirre, A.; Grosso, N. R.							Sunflower oil preservation by using chickpea flour film as bio-packaging material.		Journal of Food Science					The aim of this study was to evaluate the protective effect of biodegradable packages made with chickpea flour on the oxidation of sunflower oil. Chickpea flour films were prepared using the casting technique. To study the influence of storage time on films properties, the chickpea flour films were stored during 60 days at 25 °C and 52% relative humidity. In addition, sunflower oil samples were packaged in chickpea flour packages (CPs) and stored for 60 days at 25 °C. Lipid oxidation indicators were evaluated. The results showed that puncture force and redness values (a*) of chickpea films did not change significantly during storage. Tensile strength, Young's modulus (YM), and yellowness (b*) increased and moisture content (MC), elongation (% E), solubility (% S), water vapor permeability (WVP), and luminosity (L*) decreased. Microscopic images showed the presence of a few cracks in the film network at storage day 60. Conjugated dienes and peroxide value increased less for sunflower oil stored in high-barrier plastic pouches and CPs during storage than the control treatment. CPs helped to preserve the chemical quality of sunflower oil samples, proving to be a promising alternative to develop biodegradable packaging to be used in oily food preservation. Practical Application. Discarded chickpea grains are those split and different color grains that are separated from marketable grains, and represent an industrial byproduct. These grains are currently used for feed, constituting a nutritive biomass of low commercial value. Chickpea flour is a potential material for making biodegradable films. This strategy allows adding value to the chickpea industry, transforming a byproduct into a raw material with the potential to develop economical food packaging material. The use of chickpea packages to preserve sunflower oil may be an alternative to pack vegetable oil or high lipid content food, allowing the use reduction of nonbiodegradable pouches. © 2020 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Cammarelle, A.; Viscecchia, R.; Bimbo, F.							Intention to purchase milk packaged in biodegradable packaging: evidence from Italian consumers.		Foods					The dairy industry generates large volumes of liquid waste that can be used to produce biopolymers, potentially employable for the creation of milk biodegradable bottles. In that regard, this paper aims to explore the consumers" intention to purchase sustainable packages, as well as to assess the willingness to pay for it considering renewable packages made using organic waste feedstocks from the dairy industry (e.g., whey) and plant-based material (e.g., corn, sugarcane, etc.). To reach the stated objectives, we collected individual-level information (e.g., age, gender, education, income) from a convenient sample of 260 Italian consumers and a modified version of the Theory of Planned Behavior estimated using a structural equation model. Findings show that attitudes and perceived behavioral control are the most important drivers of the consumers' intention to purchase sustainable packages. Finally, statistics show that respondents slightly prefer to purchase products packaged using plant-based biodegradable material, as well as most of the respondents show a low willingness to pay for milk offered in biodegradable packaging, regardless of the raw material used. Then, policymakers and companies should invest in educational/informational campaigns pointing out the beneficial effects on the environment from the purchase of foods in sustainable packaging. This may potentially increase the consumers" intention to purchase, as well as their willingness to pay for plant-based and dairy whey-based packages by increasing the sustainability of the dairy supply chain. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cammerata, A.; Sestili, F.; Laddomada, B.; Aureli, G.							Bran-enriched milled durum wheat fractions obtained using innovative micronization and air-classification pilot plants.		Foods					Dietary guidelines recommend the consumption of unprocessed, or minimally processed, wheat foods because they are richer in health-promoting components (i.e., minerals, vitamins, lignans, phytoestrogens, and phenolic compounds) compared to traditionally refined products. The design and implementation of technological solutions applied to the milling process are becoming a key requirement to obtain less refined mill products characterized by healthier nutritional profiles. This study presents the development of an upgraded micronization plant and of a modified air-classification plant to produce several novel types of durum wheat milling fractions, each enriched in bran particles of different sizes (from 425 m > Phi to Phi < 180 m) and percentage ratios. A preliminary quality assessment of the milling fractions was carried out by measuring yield percentages and ash content, the latter being related to detect the presence of bran particles. A wide array of milling fractions with different original particle size compositions was provided through the study of the process. Results. Indicate the ability of the novel pilot plants to produce several types of less refined milling fractions of potential interest for manufacturing durum wheat end-products beneficial for human health. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Durum wheat milling is a key process step to improve the quality and safety of final products. The aim of this study was to characterize three bran-enriched milling fractions (i.e., F250, G230 and G250), obtained from three durum wheat grain samples, by using an innovative micronization and air-classification technology. Milling fractions were characterized for main standard quality parameters and for alveographic properties, starch composition and content, phenolic acids, antioxidant activity and ATIs. Results showed that yield recovery, ash content and particle size distributions were influenced either by the operating conditions (230 or 250) or by the grain samples. While total starch content was lower in the micronized sample and air-classified fractions, the P/L ratio increased in air-classified fractions as compared to semolina. Six main individual phenolic acids were identified through HPLC-DAD analysis (i.e., ferulic acid, vanillic acid, p-coumaric acid, sinapic acid, syringic and p-hydroxybenzoic acids). Compared to semolina, higher contents of all individual phenolic components were found in all bran-enriched fractions. The highest rise of TPAs occurred in the F250 fraction, which was maintained in the derived pasta. Moreover, bran-enriched fractions showed significant reductions of ATIs content versus semolina. Overall, our data suggest the potential health benefits of F250, G230 and G250 and support their use to make durum-based foods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Evaluation of biochemical juice attributes and color-related traits in muscadine grape population.		Foods					Biochemical juice attributes and color-related traits of muscadine grape genotypes have been investigated. For this study, 90 muscadine genotypes, including 21 standard cultivars, 60 breeding lines, and 9 Vitis x Muscadinia hybrids (VM), were evaluated. The biochemical properties of total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity, and TSS/Acid (T/A) ratio showed modest diversity among genotypes with a range of 10.3 °Brix, 2.1 mg tartaric acid/L, and 4.6, respectively. Nonetheless, the pH trait exhibited a tight range of 0.74 among the population with a minimum and maximum pH of 3.11 0.12 and 3.85 0.12. Color-related traits showed more deviation between individuals. Total anthocyanin content (TAC), luminosity index (L*), hue angle (h°), and chroma index (C*) displayed a range of 398 g/g DW, 33.2, 352.1, and 24, respectively. The hierarchical clustering map classified the population into two large groups of colored and non-colored grapes based on L* and h°, suggesting the predominance of these two characters among the population. The colored berries genotypes clade was further divided into several sub-clades depending on C*, TAC, and TSS levels. The principal component analysis (PCA) separated the four-color characteristics into two groups with a negative correlation between them, L* and C* versus TAC and h°. Further, PCA suggested the positive influence of acidity in enhancing the different nutraceutical components. Despite the nature of anthocyanins as a member of phenolic compounds, a lack of significant correlation between TAC and nutraceutical-related traits was detected. The dissimilatory matrix analysis highlighted the muscadine individuals C11-2-2, E16-9-1, O21-13-1, and Noble as particular genotypes among the population due to enhanced color characteristics. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Campbell, J. R.; Grosnickel, F.; Kennedy, J. A.; Waterhouse, A. L.							Anthocyanin addition alters tannin extraction from grape skins in model solutions via chemical reactions.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Condensed tannin extraction and stable color formation are two of the cornerstones of red wine production. Without condensed tannin, red wine would lack the tactile feeling of astringency, and without the formation of modified pigments, it would lack color stability for long-term aging. To understand how malvidin-3,5-diglucoside interacts with condensed tannin under nonoxidative conditions, an experiment was designed conducting model-wine skin extractions of Sauvignon blanc grapes harvested at various dates of maturity. Monomeric malvidin-3,5-diglucoside was isolated from color concentrate and added during these extractions. Following a 72 h extraction, solutions were evaluated for recovery of monomeric anthocyanins, skin tannin concentration, skin tannin extractability, and impact of anthocyanins on condensed tannin size. Anthocyanins showed a significant impact on the extraction of flavan-3-ol material in the early stages of ripening that declined in the latter stages of ripening. Furthermore, anthocyanins significantly decreased the size of the condensed tannin extracted. These results suggest that anthocyanins are not only enhancing the extractability of condensed tannin but also readily incorporating into the polymeric material, leading to a decrease in the average molecular mass of the condensed tannin polymer. The extent of reaction in 72 h suggests that the rate of interflavan bond cleavage may be higher than previously reported and merits closer scrutiny.

Assessment of paprika geographical origin fraud by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) fingerprinting.		Food Chemistry					Paprika production under the protected designation of origin (PDO) standardized procedures leads to more quality products. However, it is also related to higher retail prices, making them susceptible to adulteration with low-quality paprika or its agricultural origin's mislabeling. Therefore, in this study, high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) fingerprints, strongly related to phenolic acid and polyphenolic compounds, were proposed as chemical markers to assess the classification of paprika from five European regions (three Spanish PDO, Hungary, and the Czech Republic), through a classification decision tree constructed by partial least squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models. After external validation, an excellent classification accuracy of 97.9% was achieved. Moreover, the chromatographic fingerprints were also proposed to detect and quantitate two different paprika geographical origin blend scenarios by partial least squares (PLS) regression. Low external validation and prediction errors-with values below 1.6 and 10.7%, respectively-were obtained. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In order to update the Spanish food composition database, 4 males from each of the following breeds and commercial categories were selected: suckling kids of Murciano-Granadina breed, suckling lambs of Churra and Castellana breeds, and light lambs of Manchega, Merina, Rasa Aragonesa and Segurena breeds. These breeds correspond with the highest census of goats and sheep of Spanish breeds, are located throughout the country, and represent a large proportion of the meat from small ruminants produced in Spain. The shoulder, loin+rack and leg were used. Tissue composition through the dissection of the shoulder was assessed. The edible portion of each joint was obtained to analyze the proximate, fatty acid, cholesterol, mineral and vitamin compositions. For those consumers who want to reduce the intake of fat in their diet, the leg or the shoulder are the recommended joints with a lower fat content than the loin+rack. Meat from Spanish small ruminants is an excellent source of quality nutrients, being high in protein, zinc, pyridoxine and cyanocobalamin, and a source of selenium, phosphorus, potassium and niacin, as well as low in sodium. Therefore, its consumption within a balanced diet guaranties the intake of valuable and essential micronutrients.

Microbiological characteristics of Canastra cheese during manufacturing and ripening.		Food Control					Canastra cheese is an artisanal product from the Serra da Canastra region in Brazil. It is produced with raw milk and an endogenous culture called pingo. Brazilian legislation requires 22 days of ripening to ensure microbiological safety. This study evaluated the microbiological characteristics of samples collected in two settings. In the first, samples were harvested along the manufacturing process (including milk, pingo, curd and cheese at different ripening times) from three producers registered in the state's quality program. In the second setting, cheese samples were collected from 78 local producers, after ripening. All samples were assessed for total coliforms, Escherichia coli, coagulase positive Staphylococcus and submitted to pH measurement. Enterobacteriaceae, Salmonella spp., and Listeria monocytogenes were tested in cheeses from the second setting, in addition to aw measurement. Results collected during cheese production indicated that the regulatory microbiological limits related to counts of total coliforms, E. coli and Staphylococcus could be reached before 22 days. Conversely, the study with cheeses collected from a larger pool of producers (samples with 22 days of ripening) showed a high number of non-compliances to the Brazilian regulation, regardless of registration in the quality program. Counts of coagulase positive Staphylococcus were above the legal limits in many samples, one was positive for L. monocytogenes, while Salmonella was not detected.

Meat Science					The objective of this study was to evaluate the replacement of part of the pork from Cuiabana sausage by a brewery by-product on the physicochemical and microbiological properties during storage. Brewery by-product (BW) concentration influenced sausage colouration, with reduced luminosity, L*: 52.060 in the 6% (w/w) treatment compared to the 0% treatment controls (L*: 63.956). Titratable acidity showed higher (1.162 g/100 g) compared to the 0% treatment controls (1.093 g/100 g) of lactic acid. Proteins and total enzymatic fibers increased, 19.068 and 9.233 g/100 g of sample respectively. It was observed that the by-product did not interfere in the oxidation of the lipids and the best model to describe the oxidation of lipids is Van Bertalanffy model (P< 0.05). Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus sp. levels were within the prescribed limits and Listeria monocytogenes colonies were observed. The addition of by-products had no interference on the formation of oxidation compounds in the sausage and has increased fiber content.

Aspergillus flavus growth inhibition and aflatoxin B1 decontamination by Streptomyces isolates and their metabolites.		Toxins					Aflatoxin B1 is a potent carcinogen produced by Aspergillus flavus, mainly during grain storage. As pre-harvest methods are insufficient to avoid mycotoxin presence during storage, diverse curative techniques are being investigated for the inhibition of fungal growth and aflatoxin detoxification. Streptomyces spp. represent an alternative as they are a promising source of detoxifying enzymes. Fifty-nine Streptomyces isolates and a Streptomyces griseoviridis strain from the commercial product Mycostop, evaluated against Penicillium verrucosum and ochratoxin A during previous work, were screened for their ability to inhibit Aspergillus flavus growth and decrease the aflatoxin amount. The activities of bacterial cells and cell-free extracts (CFEs) from liquid cultures were also evaluated. Fifty-eight isolates were able to inhibit fungal growth during dual culture assays, with a maximal reduction going down to 13% of the control. Aflatoxin-specific production was decreased by all isolates to at least 54% of the control. CFEs were less effective in decreasing fungal growth (down to 40% and 55% for unheated and heated CFEs, respectively) and aflatoxin-specific production, with a few CFEs causing an overproduction of mycotoxins. Nearly all Streptomyces isolates were able to degrade AFB1 when growing in solid and liquid media. A total degradation of AFB1 was achieved by Mycostop on solid medium, as well as an almost complete degradation by IX20 in liquid medium (6% of the control). CFE maximal degradation went down to 37% of the control for isolate IX09. The search for degradation by-products indicated the presence of a few unknown molecules. The evaluation of residual toxicity of the tested isolates by the SOS chromotest indicated a detoxification of at least 68% of AFB1's genotoxicity. © 2021 by the authors.

Impact of incorporating double emulsions with bioactive compounds of acid cactus fruits in emulsified meat products during storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The impact of incorporating bioactive compounds of xoconostle in a double emulsion (DE) formulation in emulsified pork meat products during storage was evaluated. The DE was prepared using xoconostle extract, canola oil, and whey protein. Meat products containing different percentages of DE (MPDE) were formulated: 0% (control), 5%, 10%, 20%, and 30%. Evaluation of physicochemical parameters, texture profile, total phenols, antioxidant capacity, and oxidative stability was performed within 35 days. Differences were observed in the physicochemical parameters of meat products, with increased moisture and protein content compared with the control. Regarding texture, hardness and chewiness were directly proportional to the quantity of added DE. MPDE 30% maintained a high concentration of phenolic compounds. Furthermore, with the addition of DE, it was possible to maintain a good oxidative stability. Our findings show that the incorporation of xoconostle in DEs can significantly improve the physicochemical properties, texture, and antioxidant activity of emulsified meat products. Practical applications. Processed meat products are widely consumed worldwide, mostly due to their longer shelf life and versatility in their preparation compared to raw meat. Overall, meat products have a high demand in the market; therefore, it is imperative to reformulate these products to include more benefits. They can be excellent vehicles for bioactive compounds of natural origin (such as compounds from xoconostle fruits) due to their natural conformation, which can help to prevent the oxidation problems in foods without the rejections to synthetic antioxidants commonly used. Another benefit of emulsified meat products is the ability to reduce the saturated fat content that is predominant in these products. All together, these benefits can be achieved without compromising the structural or textural properties characteristic of these foods. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Chemistry					Arsenic speciation analysis in dried seaweeds was carried out using an on-line HPLC-UV-thermo-oxidation-HG-AFS system. Species separated and quantified were: arsenite [As (III)], arsenate [As (V)], monomethylarsonic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) and different arsenosugars. Extraction efficiency ranged between 38 and 83%. Chromatographic separation was achieved in gradient elution mode using (NH4)2CO3As mobile phase in the pH range 9-10.3. Total As concentration was quantified by ICP-MS after microwave digestion. Limits of detection were in the range 3.0 to 6.0 ng g-1 for the species under study based on peak height and the relative standard deviation was <8% at 10 g L-1 As. The accuracy of the procedure was verified by analyzing the CRM BCR-279 Ulva lactuca. Results for total As were in agreement with the certified values. The HPLC-(UV)-HG-AFS system resulted suitable for quantification of eight As compounds. Results showed that arsenosugars are the most abundant compounds in the investigated seaweeds.

J		Can Li; Tianyu Xu; Xing Wang Liu; Xiaohan Wang; Tao Xia							The expression of beta-glucosidase during natto fermentation increased the active isoflavone content.		Food Bioscience					Natto is a traditional food fermented by Bacillus subtilis natto with soybean as raw material and contains a variety of active substances, especially flavonoid. Flavonoids in soybean usually exist in the form of inactive glycosides, which can only play biological activities when being decomposed into free isoflavone aglycone by beta-glucosidase. In this study, the relationship between the activity of beta-glucosidase, the expression of beta-glucosidase coding genes and the content and structure of active isoflavones in Bacillus natto was systematically elucidated for the first time. In this research, more than 70 kinds of flavonoids have been identified and the active isoflavones in natto increased by 2.2 times compared with soybeans. Furthermore, the activity of beta-glucosidase and the expression level of its coding genes were both increased, which laid a theoretical foundation for further understanding the active substances and physiological functions of natto and the application of beta-glucosidase in food industry.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Cassava is rich in nutrition and has high edible value, but the development of the cassava industry is limited by the traditional low added value processing and utilization mode. In this study, cassava tuber was used as beer adjunct to develop a complete set of fermentation technology for manufacturing cassava beer. Results. The activities of transaminase, phenylpyruvate decarboxylase and dehydrogenase in 2-phenylethanol Ehrlich biosynthesis pathway of Saccharomyces cerevisiae were higher in cassava beer than that of malt beer. Aminotransferase ARO9 gene and phenylpyruvate decarboxylase ARO10 gene were up-regulated in the late stage of fermentation, which indicated that they were the main regulated genes of 2-phenylethanol Ehrlich pathway with phenylalanine as substrate in cassava beer preparation. Conclusions. Compared with traditional wheat beer, cassava beer was similar in the content of nutrition elements, diacetyl, total acid, alcohol and carbon dioxide, but has the characteristics of fresh fragrance and better taste. The hydrocyanic acid contained in cassava root tubes was catabolized during fermentation and compliant with the safety standard of beverage. Further study found that the content of 2-phenylethanol in cassava beer increased significantly, which gave cassava beer a unique elegant and delicate rose flavor. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	10	4050	4058	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11040					FSTA:2021-10-Hc9093

Food Chemistry					As a homologous material of both medicine and food, licorice is a famous traditional Chinese medicine. In the application process, different origins and different extraction methods have an impact on the intrinsic quality of licorice. In order to ensure the intrinsic quality of commercially available licorice products, and to explore the influence of origin and extraction methods on the quality of licorice, we put forward a simple and effective discriminatory method for "chemometrics analysis-based fingerprint establishment". First, fingerprints of licorice ethanol extraction (LEE) and licorice water extraction (LWE) were established. Then, similarity analysis (SA), hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and other chemometrics methods were used to select qualitative and quantitative markers. Besides, the quantitative determination of 7 compounds of licorice with statistical significance was carried out, which provided accurate and informative data for quality evaluation. Finally, discriminant analysis was used to trace the origin of licorice. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	340				0308-8146				10.1016/j.foodchem.2020.127907					FSTA:2021-03-Tb1119
J		Can Xiang; Shaobo Li; Huan Liu; Ce Liang; Fei Fang; Dequan Zhang; Zhenyu Wang							Impact of chilling rate on the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds in raw lamb meat during refrigeration.		Foods					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of chilling rate (1.44, 22.2, and 32.4 °C/h) on the evolution of volatile and non-volatile compounds in raw lamb meat during refrigeration (1, 24, 72, and 120 h). Through orthogonal projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis, the calculation of odor activity values (OAV > 1) and taste activity values (TAV > 1) analysis, 1-octen-3-ol, (E, E)-2,4-decadienal, nonanal, hexanal, nona-3,5-dien-2-one, 2,3-octanedione, hexanoic acid, 1-nonen-4-ol, aspartate (Asp), Glutamic Acid (Glu), 5′-GMP, 5′-IMP, and 5′-AMP were regarded as differential flavor or taste compounds for raw meat undergone different chilling rates. With a rapid chilling rate at 24 h after slaughter, the contribution of 1-octen-3-ol decreased, but (E, E)-2,4-decadienal increased. Moreover, at 24 h post-mortem, the equivalent umami concentration of Asp, Glu, 5′-GMP, 5′-IMP and 5′-AMP in raw meat were significantly lower at a chilling rate of 1.44 °C/h than 32.4 °C/h (p< 0.05). Conclusively, under the rapid chilling rate, more fatty odor and umami compounds accumulated in 24 h aged meat. © 2021 by the authors.

Physicochemical properties and stability of pumpkin seed oil as affected by different extraction methods and species.		International Food Research Journal					The present work evaluated the influence of extraction method and species on the physicochemical properties, oxidative stability, fatty acid profiles, and rheological behaviour of pumpkin seed oils. The seeds of two pumpkin species (Cucurbita argyrosperma Huber [CA] and Cucurbita moschata Duchesne [CM]) were obtained from small-scale pumpkin processors in Yucatan, Mexico. The oils were extracted by two methods: mechanical pressing (MP) and organic solvent (OS). It was found that the oil extraction method, species, and their interaction significantly influenced the physicochemical properties and oxidative stability of the seed oils. The composition and fatty acid content of the oils were comparable to those of other pumpkin species. The oil yield from the MP method was lower than that from the OS method. Also, CA oil extracted by MP had an olive-green colour as compared to the reddish-yellow colour of CM oil, and also had a higher oxidative stability. The viscosity of CA oil extracted by MP was superior to that extracted by OS. Also, CA oil had a higher content of iron, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), stearic acid, and oleic acid as well as viscosity in comparison to CM oil, although CM oil had a higher content of linoleic acid. This information can be used to obtain more stable pumpkin oils with enhanced properties that would benefit both producers and processors.

Journal of Dairy Science					Chymosin is a predominant enzyme in rennet and is used in cheese production because of its excellent milk-clotting activity. Herein, we proposed a facile and label-free electrochemical method for determining chymosin activity based on a peptide-based enzyme substrate. The synthesized substrate peptide for chymosin was assembled onto the surface of the Au-deposited grassy carbon electrode. The current was proportional to chymosin activity, and thus chymosin activity could be determined. The detection ranges of chymosin activity were 2.5 to 25 U mL-1. The detection limit of chymosin activity was 0.8 U mL-1. The sensing platform was used to quantify chymosin activity in commercial rennet with high selectivity, excellent stability, and satisfactory reproducibility. We developed a facile, fast, and effective electrochemical assay for detecting chymosin activity, which has potential applications in cheesemaking.

Occurrence of common plastic additives and contaminants in mussel samples: validation of analytical method based on matrix solid-phase dispersion.		Food Chemistry					A new matrix solid-phase dispersion (MSPD) extraction methodology, combined with high-performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode-array detector, was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of 10 compounds in mussels from Galician Rias (Spain). These pollutants are compounds commonly used for plastic production as additives, as well as common plastic contaminants. The compounds selected were bisphenol-A, bisphenol-F, bisphenol-S, nonylphenol-9, nonylphenol, diethyl phthalate, dibutyl phthalate, di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. The parameters affecting the MSPD extraction efficiency such as the type of sorbent, mass sample-sorbent ratio, and extraction solvent were optimised. The proposed method provided satisfactory quantitative recoveries (80-100%), with relative standard deviations lower than 7%. In all cases, the matrix-matched calibration curves were linear in the concentration range of 0.32-120.00 g/kg, with quantification limits of 0.25-16.20 g/kg. The novel developed MSPD-high-performance liquid chromatography methodology provided good sensitivity, accuracy, and repeatability for quality control analysis in mussels.

Food Chemistry					The aim of this paper is to optimize a method to recover polysaccharides from white grape pomace (non-fermented), the main waste by-product of the food industry. Different conditions are tested and the polysaccharides extracted are analyzed by high performance size exclusion chromatography with refractive index detector (HPSEC-RID) and gas chromatography with mass detector (GC-MS). The extraction solvent did not show a significant effect on the polysaccharide extraction, acid pH yielded to higher efficiencies, and longer extraction times extracted more smaller polysaccharides (≤5.4 kg mol-1). The highest efficiencies were obtained with both solvents at pH 1 and 1:4 solid to liquid ratio. The optimum conditions selected (TA as solvent of extraction, 2.5 g L-1 solvent concentration, pH=1,1:4 solid to liquid ratio, and 18 h of extraction time) allow the extraction of polysaccharides rich in arabinose and galactose, rhamnogalacturonans, homogalacturonans and glucosyl polysaccharides, under efficient and food-safe conditions.

Antioxidant effect of rice bran purified phytic acid on mechanically deboned chicken meat.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant effect of rice bran purified phytic acid (PA; 78.2%) and compare it with the standard high purity rice PA (≥90%) after added to mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) and stored at -18 °C for 120 days. Rice bran purified PA (RPA) and standard PA (SPA) were added to MDCM at 5 and 10 mmol/kg and MDCM samples were analyzed for lipid oxidation by thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), warmed-over flavor (WOF), and estimated myoglobin content at 15 days intervals for up to 120 days. RPA addition to MDCM stored for 120 days at -18 °C inhibited lipid oxidation, reducing WOF, and heme pigment oxidation that maintains the characteristic MDCM color. The results suggested that RPA is a suitable and efficient natural antioxidant in MDCM. Practical applications. Mechanically deboned chicken meat (MDCM) is a poultry deboned carcass by-product and an important raw material for cooked meat production. MDCM stability is affected by bone separation, grinding process, and bone marrow content (hemoglobin-rich). The meat industry demands quality and stability improvements for MDCM due to its rapid propensity for oxidation. Phytic acid (myo-inositol hexaphosphate) is a powerful antioxidant with potential use in foods. It is efficient, safe, and naturally sourced. It alters redox potential, keeping it in Fe3+ form, protecting it against oxidative damage, thus improving the MDCM quality. The present study results are expected to contribute to the meat industry in producing safe and quality products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Functional Foods					Quinoa sourdough can safely be produced if the hygienic threshold of miss-fermentation during the start-up period is overcome. The aims of the present study are to map the microbiota of spontaneously formed quinoa sourdough without backslopping and select Lactiplantibacillus-strains. Viable count from grains and sourdough were performed and picked isolates were identified by gene sequencing. Lactiplantibacillus interspecies differentiation was evaluated by specific primers targeting the recA region, fermentation capacity and enzymatic abilities applying colorimetric assays, respectively. High initial levels of Enterobacteriaceae and other opportunistic pathogens decreased gradually, and the pH dropped below 4. The results indicate that spontaneous fermentation involves a variety of quinoa autochthonous microorganisms, with low presence of lactobacilli due to the delay lactic acid fermentation. Lactobacilli strains able to ferment xylose and glycerol and metabolize phenolic compounds were identified holding great prospects as suitable starter cultures for production of fermented quinoa products.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this research, a new alternative food product, defined as brown rice bulgur (BRB), rich in functional components compared to white rice and cooked in a short time compared to brown rice was developed for society especially individuals with gluten intolerance and celiac disease. BRB was produced with two different methods as boiling (BRB-B) and steaming (BRB-S). The cooking time of raw brown rice decreased from 30 to 9 min in BRB samples. The phytic acid content of BRB samples decreased by about 15% and enzyme resistant starch content of BRB-B and BRB-S samples increased by about 9% and 21% compared to brown rice, respectively. The produced BRB samples were in the medium GI food group. In conclusion, it was evaluated that the newly developed BRB is superior than brown rice, white rice, and wheat bulgur in terms of short cooking time, lower GI, and being gluten-free, respectively. Practical applications. In this study, brown rice bulgur has been produced from brown rice, unpreferable by consumers due to its long cooking time, hard texture, and dark color, with wheat bulgur production method. This new food product includes the advantages of wheat bulgur such as resistivity to insect and mold activity because of applied high-temperature thermal process and drying process, but do not include the disadvantages of brown rice such as long cooking time. Additionally, it could be attention to some consumers because of being a new gluten-free product. The obtained data can help diversify this product in the food industry. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Candan, D.; Oktay, Z.; Coskun, C.							Design and an instantaneous experimental analysis of photovoltaic-assisted heat pump dryer for agricultural applications using banana chips.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					In this study, a prototype small-scale photovoltaic-assisted heat pump dryer (SSPVAHPD) has been designed for sustainable agricultural applications and tested by drying banana chips. The measurements were performed in real-time, with a data acquisition step of 1 s. This is the first study in the published literature to experimentally determine different drying performance parameters with a data acquisition step of 1 s. The same drying process was performed six times in a row under real ambient conditions to determine the actual system performance. Instantaneous energy performance of both the SSPVAHPD and the heat pump system (HPS) was investigated during the drying period. For the developed drying regime, the average coefficient of performance (COP) was calculated to be 5.338 for the HPS. The instantaneous energy efficiency of the PV system achieved an average of 9.11% and a maximum of 17% depending on solar radiation, ambient temperature, and wind speed. As a result of the experiments, the instantaneous energy efficiency of the SSPVAHPD varied between 11.82 and 95.47%, with an average of 48.46%. The instantaneous specific moisture extraction rate (SMER) under test conditions started at 16.393kg/kWh and dropped down to 0.041kg/kWh-an average of 0.45kg/kWh. Practical Applications. This is the first study in the literature to examine the PV-assisted drying process using instant data. In the context of renewable energy use, it has revealed important results for sustainable agricultural practices. It has been demonstrated by the tests that the system can dry with the energy obtained from the sun with high efficiency independent of the grid. In the study, it is possible to use the drying system examined for many different food products, apart from the banana product examined.

Maternal intake of dietary fat pre-programs offspring's gut ecosystem altering colonization resistance and immunity to infectious colitis in mice.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. The transgenerational impact of dietary fat remains unclear. Here, the role of maternal fat consumption as a modulator of gut microbial communities and infectious disease outcomes in their offspring is explored. Methods and results. C57BL/6 mice are fed isocaloric high-fat diets throughout breeding, gestation and lactation. Diets contained either milk fat (MF), olive oil (OO) or corn oil (CO), with or without fish oil. The pups born to maternally exposed mice are weaned on to chow and raised into adulthood. At 8 weeks, the offsprings are either euthanized for colonic 16S rRNA analysis or challenged with the enteric pathogen, Citrobacter rodentium. Maternal CO exposure resulted in unique clustering of bacterial communities in offspring compared with MF and OO. Diets rich in CO reduced survival in offspring challenged with C. rodentium. The addition of fish oil did not improve mortality caused by CO and worsened disease outcomes when combined with OO. Unlike the unsaturated diets, MF is protective with and without fish oil. Conclusions. Overall, these data reveal that maternal intake of fatty acids do have transgenerational impacts on their offspring's bacteriome and enteric infection risk. Based on this study, saturated fats should be included in maternal diets. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	6			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202000635					FSTA:2021-07-Aj10495

Effect of the ingestion of vegetable oils associated with energy-restricted normofat diet on intestinal microbiota and permeability in overweight women.		Food Research International					Previous studies suggest that the type of dietary fatty acid may modulate the intestinal bacterial ecosystem. However, this effect is still inconclusive. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the intake of vegetable oils rich in different types of fatty acids, associated with energy-restricted normofat diets, on the composition of intestinal microbiota and permeability, on LPS concentrations, and fecal short chain fatty acids and pH. This was a 9 consecutive weeks (5 days), randomized, parallel, double-blind clinical trial. Overweight women received daily breakfast containing 25 mL of one of the test oils: soybean oil (n=17), extra virgin olive oil (n=19) or coconut oil (n=16). Blood, fecal and urine samples were collected on the first and last day of the experiment for the analysis of the variables of interest. The consumption of the three oils did not affect the diversity and relative abundance of intestinal bacteria. We observed an increase in bacterial richness estimated by the Chao 1 index, and a reduction in the concentration of isovaleric fatty acid in the group that ingested soybean oil. Paracellular and transcellular permeability increased after the ingestion of extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil. However, LPS concentrations remained unchanged. The intake of different types of fatty acids associated with the energy-restricted normofat diet modestly affected the intestinal microbiota and permeability, without resulting in metabolic endotoxemia in overweight women.

A novel approach to ameliorate experimental milk allergy based on the oral administration of a short soy cross-reactive peptide.		Food Chemistry					Food allergy is on the rise, and preventive/therapeutic procedures are needed. We explored a preventive protocol for milk allergy with the oral administration of a Gly-m-Bd-30K soy-derived peptide that contains cross-reactive epitopes with bovine caseins. B/T-cross-reactive epitopes were mapped using milk-specific human sera and monoclonal antibodies on overlapping and recombinant peptides of Gly-m-Bd-30K by SPOT and cell proliferation assays. Bioinformatics tools were used to characterize epitopes on the 3D-modelled molecule, and to predict the binding to HLA alleles. The peptide was orally administrated to mice that were then IgE-sensitized to milk proteins. Immunodominant B-epitopes were mainly located on the surface of the Nt-fragment. The use of a soy-peptide-containing an immunodominant cross-reactive T-epitope, along with a single B epitope, prevents IgE-mediated milk sensitization through the induction of Th1-mediated immunity and induction of blocking IgG. The use of a safe soy-peptide may represent a promising alternative for preventing milk allergy. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Fast quantitative determination of phenolic compounds in grape juice by UPLC-MS: method validation and characterization of juices produced with different grape varieties.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					A fast method for the simultaneous quantitative determination of 16 phenolic compounds in grape juice by UPLC-MS was developed and validated. Run time was 4.5 min and the method proved to be specific, linear (r> 0.9961), precise (RSD<5%), accurate (recovery range was under 5%) and sensitive with a limit of detection ranging from 0.45 to 35.34 mug L-1 and limit of quantification ranging from 1.35 to 107.08 mug L-1. The validated method was used to characterize 49 grape juice samples which were produced with different grape varieties. Anthocyanins were the compounds present in the highest amounts on the analyzed samples and BRS-Violeta was the cultivar that presented the highest quantity of phenolic compounds in its juice. Exploratory analysis of the obtained results from the characterization of grape juice samples was performed and a tendency to form groups according to the grape variety used in the elaboration of each juice was observed. Results confirmed that the UPLC-MS method is effective and suitable for the determination of phenolic compounds in grape juice. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

The use of ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry to assess the migration of polyamide 6 and polyamide 66 oligomers from kitchenware utensils to food.		Food Chemistry					Oligomers, are, in general, unknown components of the polymer. These oligomers can migrate from the polymer into the food and become a non-intentionally added substance to the food. In this work, ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry has been used to identify oligomers migrating from kitchenware. The structure elucidation of oligomers from polyamide 6 and polyamide 66 was achieved through the analysis of accurate m/z values of adducts and collision cross section values of precursor ions together with high-energy fragmentation patterns. Additionally, a method to extract oligomers from sunflower oil, cooked beans, soup and whole milk has been developed. Extraction recoveries ranged from 87 to 102% and limits of detection were from 0.03 to 0.11 mg/kg. It was observed that the migration from kitchenware to real food was below the specified migration limit of 5 mg/kg. However, this limit was exceeded for food simulants, which therefore overestimated the oligomer migration. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Biochemical and morphological characterization of heterotrophic Crypthecodinium cohnii and Chlorella vulgaris cell walls.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Microalgae are attractive for the food and cosmetic industries because of their nutrient composition. However, the bioaccessibility and extractability of nutrients in microalgae are limited by the rigid and indigestible cell wall. The goal of this study is to explore the cell wall polysaccharides (CWPSs) composition and morphology in heterotrophic Crypthecodinium cohnii and Chlorella vulgaris biomasses during growth. Our results showed that glucose was the major component of CWPSs and exopolysaccharides in C. cohnii. C. vulgaris CWPSs have a similar sugar profile in exponential and stationary phases, essentially composed of rhamnose and galactose. C. vulgaris cell wall thickness increased from 82 nm in the exponential phase to 114 nm in the stationary phase and consisted of two main layers. C. cohnii′s cell wall was 133 nm thick and composed of several membranes surrounding thecal plates. Understanding of the microalgae cell wall helps developing a more efficient and targeted biorefinery approach.

Tailored enzymatic treatment of Chlorella vulgaris cell wall leads to effective disruption while preserving oxidative stability.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The green microalgae Chlorella vulgaris is a source of valuable nutrients, whose bioaccessibility is limited by the structurally complex cell wall. Enzymatic degradation of the cell wall represents a remarkable alternative to mechanical treatments due to its mildness and specificity. This work aimed to define an optimal combination of enzymes to increase the lipid and protein bioaccessibilities of C. vulgaris cells while preserving oxidative stability. Among the tested enzymes, chitinase, rhamnohydrolase, and galactanase caused the highest release of microalgae cellular material. Treatment with this enzymatic combination produced a slight increase in protein bioaccessibility, from 49.2% 3.9% to 58.7% 3.5%, but no increase in lipid bioaccessibility in comparison to the control. High-pressure homogenization (HPH) led to 61.8% 2.6% lipid and 59.8% 1.8% protein bioaccessibilities. Cell integrity was preserved after enzymatic treatment, while the mean particle size was reduced from 5 to 2 mum after HPH. Oxidative stability was maintained over 3 months of accelerated shelf life in untreated and enzymatically treated C. vulgaris biomass while HPH caused drastic instability and off-flavour formation. Although more work is needed to optimise the enzymatic treatment to maximise the nutrient bioaccessibility, the presented process was successful in preserving lipid quality.

Flavonoid contents ranged from 19.67 to 87.61 mg/100 g, high in comparison to many vegetables described in the literature. Gallic acid (11.52-418.67 mg/100 g), gallate ethyl (2026.75-5205.90 mg/100 g), ellagic acid (509.47-1630.66 mg/100 g), lutein (0.17-1.36 mg/100 g), beta-carotene (0.82-1.49 mg/100 g), and beta-cryptoxanthin (0.07-0.11 mg/100 g) were identified by HPLC, contributing to a greater valorization of the pequi peel flours. Phytochemical tests indicated the presence of hydrolyzable tannins and saponins. The detection of these compounds makes the product commercially attractive, in addition to generating value for an agro-industrial residue. The results obtained in this study confirm the multifunctional potential of pequi peel flour as a functional ingredient. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Chemical characterization and bioaccessibility assessment of bioactive compounds from umbu (Spondias tuberosa A.) fruit peel and pulp flours.		Foods					Umbu, a common fruit from the northeastern region of Brazil, contains many bioactive compounds not yet exploited. Thus, this study evaluated the potential of pulps and peels of mature and semi-mature umbu as a source of bioactive compounds. Trigonelline contents ranged from 1.75 to 6.14mg/100g, values higher than those of many vegetables described in the literature, such as corn and barley. The contents of extractable and non-extractable phenolic compounds were also higher than those of other vegetables. Bioaccessibility of total extractable phenolics, flavonoids, and tannins was determined (15.67-37.73%, 31.87-39.10% and 18.81-114.27%, respectively). The constituent polysaccharides of the pulp and peel were tentatively chemically characterized as arabinoxylans, arabinogalactans, rhamnoarabinogalactans, xyloglucans, and pectin of the rhamnogalacturonan type. The technological potential of peel flours was evaluated. The maturation advancement showed no significant changes in the technological properties of the flours, except for color and water solubility index. Results indicated excellent prospects for future research on umbu pulps and peels as potential sources of natural bioactive compounds. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Coffee husks are a major by-product of coffee production and are currently being underutilized. The aim of this work was to chemically characterize coffee husks to allow for an adequate evaluation of their potential for valorization. Blanched and non-blanched coffee husks were characterized for extractable and non-extractable phenolics, caffeine, trigonelline content, and for their polysaccharide and proximal composition. The total, soluble and insoluble fiber contents were determined, together with the husks' technological properties. Antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds of coffee husks were evaluated. Two types of husk were studied: one comprised mostly of outer skin and pulp (CH1); and other comprised mostly of parchment (CH2). Blanching had positive effects on non-extractable phenolics, chlorogenic acid and on the bioaccessibility of phenolics, promoting small reductions in extractable phenolics, protocathecuic acid, caffeine and trigonelline contents. Blanched CH1 presented more appropriate properties than CH2 for potential applications in food. It also presented better antioxidant, hydration, and oil holding properties than those of other agri-food by-products. Tentatively identified polysaccharides included galactomannans, arabinogalactans type II, pectin and cellulose. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Canio, F. de; Martinelli, E.							EU quality label vs organic food products: a multigroup structural equation modeling to assess consumers' intention to buy in light of sustainable motives.		Food Research International					Consumers are increasingly paying attention to their food choices in light of sustainability. Regional and locally produced food, as well as organic products, are experiencing an increasing success amongst consumers as perceived as authentic high-quality food products, able to contribute to sustainable methods of production and consumption. Applying the Theory of Reasoned Action, this work compares consumers' intention to buy EU quality label and organic food products. A multi-group structural equation modeling was used to estimate differences between perceived product quality, sustainable motives (i.e. willingness to pay a premium price for sustainable products and products with recyclable packaging), and health concern while controlling for product knowledge. A total of 155 organic shoppers and 215 EU quality label shoppers were surveyed for this purpose. Results revealed different motives at the roots of the two products buying choices. On one hand, shoppers are willing to pay a premium price for sustainable EU quality label foods. On the other hand, recyclable packaging is mandatory to shape the intention to buy organic foods. The study proposes theoretical and managerial implications and draws further research studies on consumers' food choices.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Sprouting is a popular method in cereal processing because sprouted grains are accepted to have high nutritional value. The increased proteolytic activity by sprouting increases the free amino acids in grains. It was hypothesized that an increased amount of tyrosine can be utilized by microorganisms during fermentation to form higher amounts of bioactive tyrosine derivatives. Sprouting increased the tyrosine and tyramine contents considerably, but increases and decreases in L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and dopamine were specific to the cereal. More tyramine, L-DOPA, and dopamine formation was observed during sourdough fermentation than that in yeast fermentation. As a result of the combined application of sprouting (48 h at 20°C) and sourdough fermentation (36 h at 30°C), the amounts of dopamine, L-DOPA, and tyramine found in rye were 27, 50, and 136 mg/kg, respectively. Cereal products rich in dopamine and L-DOPA can thus be produced as functional food ingredients with their positive effects on human health and mood.

A simple procedure to obtain a medium-size oligogalacturonic acids fraction from orange peel and apple pomace wastes.		Food Chemistry					Pectin oligosaccharides, which can be obtained from fruit wastes, have proven their potential as plant immune-system elicitors. Although the precise size of active species is still under investigation, medium size oligosaccharides have been reported as the most active. Three defined oligogalacturonic acid (OGAs) mixtures were produced from commercial pectin, orange peel and apple pomace residues. The methodology developed involves two sequential acid treatments followed by stepwise ethanol precipitation. Without the need of chromatographic separations, three different fractions were obtained. The fractions were analyzed by high performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) and were completely characterized by mass spectrometry, showing that the small size, medium size and large size fractions contained OGAs of degree of polymerization 3 to 9, 6 to 18, and 16 to 55, respectively.

Inhibition of enzymes associated with metabolic and neurological disorder by dried pomegranate sheets as a function of pomegranate cultivar and fruit puree.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus are the most extended current chronic diseases and also Alzheimer pathology which is a progressive degenerative neurological disorder. Therefore, finding effective enzyme inhibitors responsible for the development of these diseases are essential. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of fruit puree (Cydonia oblonga, Ziziphus jujube and Malus domestica) and pomegranate juice cultivar ("Mollar de Elche" and "Wonderful") of dried pomegranate sheets (DS) on the inhibition of enzymes associated with metabolic (alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and pancreatic lipase activity), and neurological disorder (acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase activity). Quality properties (colour coordinates, texture properties and sensory characteristics) of DS were also studied. In addition, it was researched the effect of storage conditions (4 months at 4 and 20 °C) on phenolic content. Results. DS from jujube had the highest antioxidant capacity and were characterized by the highest storage stability with respect to phenolic compounds. The alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50, in mgmL-1) inhibition of DS ranged from 107 to 216 and from 55.2 to values indicating no effect, respectively. The inhibition toward pancreatic lipase (IC50< 5 mgmL-1), acetylcholinesterase (ranged 9.15-22.2%) and butyrylcholinesterase (ranged 20.6-48.6%) was increased with the presence of total flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids content (identifying mainly in DS from quinces). It is noteworthy that none of the samples presented off-flavour notes, supporting the high quality of the products. Conclusion. DS can be an innovative supplement to a diet as a snack used in the prevention of neurological changes and disorders of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Starmerella bombicola and Saccharomyces cerevisiae in wine sequential fermentation in aeration condition: evaluation of ethanol reduction and analytical profile.		Foods					In the last few decades, the increase of ethanol in wine, due to global climate change and consumers' choice is one of the main concerns in winemaking. One of the most promising approaches in reducing the ethanol content in wine is the use of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in co-fermentation or sequential fermentation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this work, we evaluate the use of Starmerella bombicola and S. cerevisiae in sequential fermentation under aeration condition with the aim of reducing the ethanol content with valuable analytical profile. After a preliminary screening in synthetic grape juice, bench-top fermentation trials were conducted in natural grape juice by evaluating the aeration condition (20 mL/L/min during the first 72 h) on ethanol reduction and on the analytical profile of wines. The results showed that S. bombicola/S. cerevisiae sequential fermentation under aeration condition determined an ethanol reduction of 1.46% (v/v) compared with S. cerevisiae pure fermentation. Aeration condition did not negatively affect the analytical profile of sequential fermentation S. bombicola/S. cerevisiae particularly an overproduction of volatile acidity and ethyl acetate. On the other hand, these conditions strongly improved the production of glycerol and succinic acid that positively affect the structure and body of wine. © 2021 by the authors.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The use of non-conventional yeasts could be an interesting source of biodiversity for developing innovative fermented beverages. Here, 43 wild yeast strains belonging to different genera such as Lachancea, Kluyveromyces, Torulaspora, Metschnikowia, Kazachstania, Brettanomyces, Pichia, Candida, Hanseniaspora, Rhodotorula, Rodosporidobolus and Saccharomyces, previously evaluated for their probiotic traits, have been tested for craft beer production. Different experimental lines were carried out to develop a new beverage which could combine increased aromatic characteristics and improved nutritional properties: i) beers produced from pils wort (PW); ii) beers from pils wort enriched with lentil (PLW) or chickpea flour extracts (PCW). PW beer trials were characterized by a low ethanol content. The PCW results in beer with an unpleasant aromatic taste, while the presence of lentil (PLW) confers effective fermentative characters and pleasant aromatic notes to the final beers. The selected strains Lachancea thermotolerans, Kazachstania unispora and Saccharomyces cerevisiae determined a significantly increase in the main aromatic compounds such as ethyl acetate, isoamyl acetate and higher alcohols in PLW.

ICONS; European Food Safety Authority				Catalogue of communication tools and dissemination guidelines: benchmarking current practice in EU and Member State bodies.		EFSA Journal					A comprehensive benchmarking exercise on current best practices on communication tools and dissemination processes of EU Member State organisations plus Iceland and Norway, selected ENVI EU agencies (EFSA, EMA, ECHA, ECDC), and EU bodies (DG SANTE, JRC, EU COUN) was carried out via an online survey, remote qualitative interviews, and a desk analysis of documents and web content. These current practices have been compiled into a catalogue of communication tools and a guide to their effective dissemination. Both elements are designed to help inform the EC General Plan for Risk Communication (GPRC) and facilitate a coordinated communication framework at the EU and national level on matters relating to the food chain. The report sets out a broad overview of the current tools that are commonly used, their intended communication purposes and target audiences. It also describes dissemination channels and methods to optimise outreach. This work provides a solid platform for EU and Member State bodies to build on going forward. The report should be viewed as a living document that will evolve to meet fast-changing information needs and the requirements of the future GPRC. The catalogue highlights that multimedia tools show relatively high impact scores and high mention rates by the respondents participating in the online survey. Editorial tools are still very important, especially to reach the media. Both physical meetings and events and educational tools have very high impact scores but limited mention rates. All communication tools can be effective if properly designed (i.e. right content and tone of voice for the intended target audience (s) and disseminated through the right channels). Social media and the website are the most used dissemination channels. The reliance on campaigns is widespread as they help achieve a stronger impact on the target audience. Moreover, communication tools supported by best practices in dissemination perform much better and are used by a wider audience than tools that are merely published on an organisation's website. A systematic phased approach to dissemination (1. Planning, 2. Preparation, 3. Publication and distribution, and 4. Post-publication and distribution) is, therefore, crucial for a successful communication strategy. Effective leverage of amplifiers (planned and prepared in the first two phases) substantially increases communication tools' outreach in the publication and distribution phase. The usage of Key Performance Indicators, set during the planning phase, allows an organisation to improve both communication tools and their dissemination strategy. Post-publication and distribution is a strategic phase to learn from the outcomes and fine-tune subsequent communication practices. © European Food Safety Authority, 2021.

J		Cantillo, J.; Martin, J. C.; Roman, C.							Determinants of fishery and aquaculture products consumption at home in the EU28.		Food Quality and Preference					The European Union (EU) is the world's largest market for fishery and aquaculture products (FAPs) in nominal terms. Given the importance of these products, EU authorities and policy-makers are continuously monitoring consumer preferences and attitudes, analysing whether or not the implementation of EU policies and regulations improves the market conditions. For example, the Eurobarometer (European Union, 2018a) surveyed 27,732 EU residents including a specific module to analyse the fishery and aquaculture EU market. In this study, the dataset is used to estimate Ordered Probit models using effects coding and their marginal effects to identify the main determinants of the frequency of FAPs at-home consumption. Results. Indicate that the highest probability to consume more frequently FAPs is related to considering that one of the main reasons for buying or eating fishery and aquaculture products is because they are healthy, while the highest probability to consume less frequently FAPs is related to consumers who do not understand at all the information accompanying the products. Similarly, other important reasons for consuming FAPs more frequently are their good taste and low relative price. Also, results indicate a higher frequency of consumption of FAPs for those consumers who are over 55 years of age, are wealthy, have a wild product preference, live in a household of 3 persons or more and are very satisfied with their lives. To our best knowledge, there is not a similar approach in the current literature that considers such an extensive sample which is representative of all the countries that conform the EU28. Results. Provide valuable information especially for producers and authorities in terms of marketing and policy analysis. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cantillo, J.; Martin, J. C.; Roman, C.							A best-worst measure of attitudes toward buying seabream and seabass products: an application to the island of Gran Canaria.		Foods					Attitudes are important key drivers that affect consumers' seafood consumption. The present investigation used a best-worst scaling approach to measure the level of importance and satisfaction of consumers' attitudes towards the purchase of seabream and seabass in Gran Canaria (Spain). The investigation also compared the results of the best-worst scaling (BWS) approach with those of the traditional Likert-scale method and offers a different perspective of the results using an Importance-Satisfaction Analysis (ISA). The results indicate that the most important attributes concerned the hygiene and safety of the product, the health benefits, the freshness, the taste and the nutrients. At the same time, these attributes were ranked as those which satisfied consumers the most. However, some of the results obtained from the methodologies differed. The results suggest that, in the Likert-scale task, respondents might be overstating the importance and satisfaction of the attributes; while in the BWS, consumers were forced to evaluate a trade-off in the selection of the best and worst attributes in each scenario, so the task impeded, in principle, to define every attribute as very important and providing a high satisfaction. As a result, we consider that BWS offers more reliable and clearer results than traditional Likert-scale experiments. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Investigating the impact of regionality on the sensorial and chemical aging characteristics of Pinot noir grown throughout the U.S. West coast.		Food Chemistry					The sensorial and chemical differences among Pinot noir wines from different vineyard locations were investigated. Grapes of a single Pinot noir clone were grown on twelve different vineyard sites along the U.S. West Coast. Wines from a single vintage (2015) were made using a standardized protocol and equipment. Sensorial (i.e. aroma, taste, and mouthfeel) and chemical (i.e. polyphenolic and volatile) differences were observed among these wines at two aging time points (8- and 20- months). Vineyard location (i.e. latitude and longitude) was one of the main factors describing the major differences between the wines, while other details (i.e. soil type (60 cm), rootstock age, soil pH, rootstock type, and vines/acres) were possibly important for defining unique aging characteristics of certain vineyards. Overall, single clone Pinot noir grapes grown in different regions but made under standardized winemaking produced wines with unique chemical and sensorial profiles, which generally persisted throughout aging.

Microwave treatment enhances human gut microbiota fermentability of isolated insoluble dietary fibers.		Food Research International					Most insoluble dietary fibers are known to be relatively poorly fermented by the human gut microbiota. Here, the potential of microwave (MW) treatment to enhance the susceptibility of insoluble fruit polysaccharides to fermentation by the human gut microbiota was evaluated. Insoluble fruits dietary fibers before (xylan A, xylan T, and arabinan) and after MW (xylan A-MW, xylan T-MW, and arabinan-MW) treatment were fermented using an in vitro fermentation model. Gas production, shifts in pH, and short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production showed an increase in fermentability of all tested dietary fibers, with an average 4-fold increase in SCFAs production after microwaving with total SCFAs ranging from 17.1 mM in the arabinan-MW to 40.4 mM in the xylan T-MW. While arabinan-MW and xylan T-MW promoted all three SCFAs proportionally (acetate: propionate: butyrate), xylan A-MW led to a marked and slow increase in butyrate reaching 28.1% of total SCFAs at 24 h. Rearrangements in three-dimensional structure that potentially facilitate bacterial accessibility to the dietary fiber were observed by scanning electron microscopy in xylan A-MW, forming coin-like particles with ~1.1 m diameter. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that microbiota shifts were related to both treatment (native versus MW) and dietary fiber type with many butyrogenic species being promoted by xylan A-MW. Overall, MW treatment enhanced insoluble dietary fiber fermentability promoting increased SCFAs production and bacterial shifts which are related to health benefits. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cao, S.; Foth, M.; Powell, W.; Mcqueenie, J.							What are the effects of short video storytelling in delivering blockchain-credentialed australian beef products to China?		Foods					Short videos have become the most-liked medium for Chinese consumers to learn about a brand's products or services. This paper assesses how short video storytelling shapes Chinese consumers perceptions towards blockchain-credentialed Australian beef and their willingness to pay (WTP). A controlled experiment with a one-minute short video was implemented in an online survey. Respondents in the treatment group watched the video before filling out the survey, whereas respondents in the control group did not. The paper analyses and compares the empirical results from local (n = 76) and foreign (n = 27) consumers. Results illustrate that the short video, as part of our food communications, positively shapes consumer perception towards meat quality, labelling and traceability trust of Australian beef but has only slight or even negative effects on WTP. This could be due to the short video offering consumers a sense of supply chain visibility but not delivering the right messages to meet their expectation of blockchain credentials. Furthermore, short video storytelling effects vary among consumers with different socio-economic characteristics. Our results posit that short video storytelling can be a useful tool in communicating blockchain-credentialed food products but require the design of a tailor-made storytelling experience for diverse consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cao, Y.; Cranfield, J.; Chen Chen; Widowski, T.							Heterogeneous informational and attitudinal impacts on consumer preferences for eggs from welfare enhanced cage systems.		Food Policy					Consumers ascribing value to animal welfare related attributes has become a common interest for various stakeholders. This study investigated heterogeneous consumer preferences for eggs from the welfare enhanced production systems, and further, how the effects of information regarding these production systems depended on consumers' previous purchase experience and initial perceptions. A nationally representative sample of respondents completed a self-reported survey and a set of discrete choice experiments on egg products. Respondents were randomly assigned into two groups, with one group being offered additional information regarding the pros and cons of each housing system on various aspects (i.e., animal welfare and environmental impacts). Using the conditional logit models, results showed that consumers' willingness to pay (WTP) for egg attributes depended on previous purchase experience. Those who had purchased cage-free eggs before were willing to pay up to $1.39/dozen higher premium for the advanced cages. Furthermore, the informational impacts depended on consumers' purchase experience and initial perceptions. Inexperienced consumers were more responsive to information compared to the experienced consumers. The mixed information decreased price premium by up to 75%. Inexperienced consumers with higher perceived importance on welfare or environmental issues showed even more preference updates. While the prior attitudes helped the experienced consumers to differentiate across products, additional information lowered these attitudinal effects. These results implied that information that aimed to educate the general public had higher marginal effects on the inexperienced consumers than on the experienced ones.

J		Caocao Cao; Mingjun Tang; Nana Zhao; Shiyuan Dong; Haohao Wu							Effects of fish protein with glycation extent on gut microbiota and colonic barrier function in mice fed a high-fat diet.		Journal of Functional Foods					This study aimed to investigate how fish protein with glycation extent affects gut microbiota and colonic barrier function in mice fed a high-fat diet. The mice were fed a fish protein (MP) diet, fish protein with low, medium and high glycation extent (L-GE, M-GE and H-GE) diet for 15 weeks. The glycated fish protein diets greatly increased butyrate production, which was related to the genes expression of butyryl-CoA: acetate CoA-transferase (BUT) and butyrate kinase (BUK), and also considerably improved insulin resistance, but increased the expression of AGEs receptor (RAGE). Among the four diets, the L-GE diet markedly increased occudin and zonulin-1 (ZO-1), lowered inflammation markers, and enhanced butyrate-producing bacteria Lachnospiraceae_UCG-006 and Allobaculum, while H-GE diet decreased Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Overall, these biological effects were greatly affected by the glycation extent of fish protein, and the fish protein with low glycation extent may provide more potentially positive effects to gut health.

Food Bioscience					Moderate beer intake can have beneficial effects against chronic diseases due to the flavonoids in the hops. The present study investigated the effect of moderate beer consumption on redox parameters and liver integrity in Wistar rats subjected to a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) exposure. The total reactive antioxidant potential of eight beers from five different styles (four different standard American lagers, and the imperial red ale, Belgian tripel, blonde ale, and extra special bitter craft beers) were analyzed. Craft beers had higher antioxidant properties than standard American lager beers, with imperial red ale exhibiting the highest antioxidant properties in vitro. To observe the redox effects of beers in vivo, 70 male Wistar rats were separated in five control and five CCl4 groups (n = 7), and were given water, standard American lagers, imperial red ale, ethanol, or silymarin. Liver histology indicated no harmful effects in any of the control groups, but none of the treatments was hepatoprotective against CCl4-induced liver injury, including silymarin. Imperial red ale presented a silymarin-like effect in abdominal fats and redox status of serum and liver, suggesting that moderate daily consumption of this beer is not harmful and can increase enzymatic and non-enzymatic redox status after CCl4 insult. These results can pave the way for a better understanding of the biological and hormesis effects of beer moderate consumption.

Identification of the gamma irradiation dose applied to ground beef that reduces Shiga toxin producing Escherichia coli but has no impact on consumer acceptance.		Meat Science					The aims of the present study were: a) to estimate the minimal dose of gamma irradiation required to reduce 5 log CFU/g of native O157 and non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli population in ground beef samples inoculated with high inoculum; b) to assess its effectiveness in samples with low inoculum and 3) to evaluate consumer acceptance. Based on the results, 1 kGy was estimated as the minimal dose of gamma irradiation required to reduce 5 log CFU/g of STEC in ground beef. However, when samples with low inoculum level were subjected to 1 kGy, 3.9% of the samples were positive for stx and eae genes after an enrichment step. Consumer acceptance analysis was carried out with samples subjected to 2.5 kGy and no significant differences were found between irradiated and control samples. Therefore, 2.5 kGy was identified As the gama irradiation dose that reduces STEC but has no impact on consumer acceptance of ground beef. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Capar, T. D.; Yalcin, H.							Protein/polysaccharide conjugation via Maillard reactions in an aqueous media: impact of protein type, reaction time and temperature.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					It is generally accepted that protein-polysaccharide interactions improve the functional properties of proteins. One of the main issues, to our knowledge, of the effects of protein type and reaction conditions, is a lack of production of Maillard conjugates. This paper focuses on the effects of protein type and ratio, reaction time and temperature on the protein/polysaccharide conjugation by Maillard reactions in an aqueous media. Response Surface Methodology D-Optimal Design was used to optimize the results. Protein type, protein-polysaccharide ratio, reaction time (min) and temperature (°C) were described as factors, whereas conjugation yield (CY), conjugation efficiency (CE), and protein solubility (PS) were described as responses. The optimized parameters for maximum CE and CY determined were found to be as; reaction temperature, 90 °C; reaction time, 60 min; protein type, faba bean protein concentrate (FPC), and protein-polysaccharide ratio 1:2. SEM images, FT-IR spectra, amino acid profile, SDS-PAGE and browning index were the analyses conducted for the optimum point (FPC-Carrageenan). Conjugation was achieved successfully by the confirmation of FT-IR results. Browning index and SDS-PAGE results revealed that Maillard reactions were limited in the initial stage of the Schiff base. These findings confirm that FPC was the most suitable protein type for preparing Maillard-glycated conjugates as a promising agent.

J		Capobianco, J. A.; Armstrong, C. M.; Lee, J.; Gehring, A. G.							Detection of pathogenic bacteria in large volume food samples using an enzyme-linked immunoelectrochemical biosensor.		Food Control					Increased speed and sensitivity of testing are always desired for the detection of pathogens in foods. Presented a test sample with low microbial analyte concentration, it is an advantage to analyze as much volume as possible of the sample to attain the best limit of detection (LOD). Therefore, a rapid screening method using a novel flow-through immunoelectrochemical biosensor was developed for the detection of pathogenic bacteria (E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella) in food (ground beef). As the working electrode employed was comprised of a porous, antibody-coated graphite felt electrode that served as both a biorecognition-element coated solid support for capture of targeted pathogens as well as a signal transducer, high volumes of aqueous sample could be rapidly exposed to the solid support via gravity flow. Flow rates as high as 16.7 mL/min and 12.3 mL/min could be achieved for bacterial samples in buffer and 1:4 ground meat (beef) homogenate, respectively, with no significant effect on LOD. Fastest flow rates for beef homogenate, without clogging of the porous electrode as well as reduction in apparent electrochemical interference, was realized with a tandem combination of sample pretreatment strategies that included filtration with glass wool and graphite felt as well as continuous flow centrifugation. The LOD for 10,000 E. coli O157 cells in 5, 60, and 1000 mL of buffer was 2000,170, and 10 cells/mL, respectively in a total assay time of 3 h whereas the LOD for E. coli O157 was 400 cells/mL in 1:4 beef homogenate.

J		Caporaso, N.; Genovese, A.; Perez-Jimenez, M. A.; Olivero-David, R.; Sacchi, R.							Impact of olive harvesting date on virgin olive oil volatile composition in four Spanish varieties.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					The unique sensory characteristics of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) depend upon its volatile composition. This work investigates the impact of olive fruit harvesting time and growing location on the volatile composition of the obtained EVOO, on four typical Spanish olive varieties (Cornicabra, Picual, Castellana, Manzanilla Cacerena). Several growing locations within the Madrid region (Spain) are studied to assess the natural variability attributed to the environmental factors. Aroma compounds are analyzed by solid-phase microextraction coupled with gas-chromatography and mass spectrometry, and sensory analysis. A considerable different behavior is observed depending on the olive variety and ripening stage. Statistically significant differences are obtained for volatile compounds biosynthesized from the lipoxygenase pathway and other fatty acid metabolism routes, which results in significant differences in their aroma profiles. Practical applications. These results have practical applicability for the olive oil industry and regulatory bodies. For example, for protected designation of origin EVOOs the aroma profile needs to be consistent over different production lots. The outcome of this research is of interest to the olive oil industry to get a better insight into the expected variability and interactions among cultivars, small pedoclimatic differences within the same broader area, and the harvesting date on the sensory and volatile profile of the resulting EVOO. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Food Chemistry					This work aimed to explore the possibility of predicting total fat content in whole dried cocoa beans at a single bean level using hyperspectral imaging (HSI). 170 beans randomly selected from 17 batches were individually analysed by HSI and by reference methodology for fat quantification. Both whole (i.e. in-shell) beans and shelled seeds (cotyledons) were analysed. Partial Least Square (PLS) regression models showed good performance for single shelled beans (R2 = 0.84, external prediction error of 2.4%). For both in-shell beans a slightly lower prediction error of 4.0% and R2 = 0.52 was achieved, but fat content estimation is still of interest given its wide range. Beans were manually segregated, demonstrating an increase by up to 6% in the fat content of sub-fractions. HSI was shown to be a valuable technique for rapid, non-contact prediction of fat content in cocoa beans even from scans of unshelled beans, enabling significant practical benefits to the food industry for quality control purposes and for obtaining a more consistent raw material.

Fatty acid profile of new oat cultivars grown via organic and conventional farming.		Journal of Cereal Science					The fat content, fatty acid composition, and atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were determined in five new oat cultivars grown under organic and conventional cropping systems at two experimental localities. The total fat content in the dehulled grain samples ranged from 4.8 to 6.0%. Naked oat Patrik had a significantly higher fat content than the hulled oat cultivars. Linoleic acid (37.8-40.0%), oleic acid (34.8-38.5%), and palmitic acid (17.1-19.8%) were the most abundant fatty acids in the evaluated oat cultivars. The sum of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids ranged from 36.1 to 39.7%, 40.17-42.7%, and 19.4-22.4% of the total fatty acids, respectively. The content of fat, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic fatty acids, similar to that of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, was significantly affected by the environmental conditions (locality), whereas that of palmitic acid and saturated fatty acids was affected mainly by cultivar. The effect of the cropping system was insignificant. All evaluated oat cultivars had favourable atherogenic (0.23-0.27) and thrombogenic (0.41-0.49) indices. Thus, they could be a good source of nutritionally valuable oil. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effects of red rice or buckwheat addition on nutritional, technological, and sensory quality of potato-based pasta.		Foods					This work investigates the effects of red rice (R) or buckwheat (B) flour addition on nutritional, technological, and sensory quality of potato-based pasta (gnocchi). Three gluten-free (GF) and three conventional (C) samples were produced in an industrial line without any addition or with 20% R or B. R and B addition significantly (p< 0.05) reduced starch content and increased fat amount and ready digestible starch fraction (potential higher glycemic impact). R addition significantly (p< 0.05) worsened GF pasta structure, increasing solid loss in cooking water (5.4 1.2 vs. 4.1 0.5 g/100 g pasta) and reducing product firmness (408 13 vs. 108 2 N). B addition resulted in intermediate consistency (243 8 N), despite the highest total fiber content and weight increase during cooking. Similar trends were found in C samples, indicating a better texturizing capacity of B in comparison to R. Samples without any addition were the most liked (C = 67.4 and GF = 60.6). Texture was the major contributor to liking: uniform structure and firm texture were positive predictors of liking, whereas a granular and coarse matrix contributed negatively. The outcomes of this research can be useful in developing GF potato-based pasta for consumers focused on healthier foods and for industries willing to better valorize their products. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cappellotto, M.; Olsen, A.							Food texture acceptance, sensory sensitivity, and food neophobia in children and their parents.		Foods					This study aims to explore whether children's food texture preferences are associated with different levels of sensory sensitivity and food neophobia, as well as with other variables, such as parental texture preferences. An online questionnaire was completed by 70 children aged 6-13 years old, alongside one of their parents. Generic texture preferences of children and parents were investigated with the Child Food Texture Preference Questionnaire (CFTPQ). Parents provided background information about their children by completing the Food Neophobia Scale (FNS), the Short Sensory Profile (SSP) and a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The results showed that children who differed in their texture-liker status also differed in their levels of food neophobia and sensory information processing: children who preferred softer and non-particulate versions of foods were found to be more neophobic and sensory sensitive across all sensory domains. No relationship was found between parental and children's texture preferences. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Capriles, V. D.; Conti-Silva, A. C.; Areas, J. A. G.							Effects of oligofructose-enriched inulin addition before and after the extrusion process on the quality and postprandial glycemic response of corn-snacks.		Food Bioscience					Extruded snacks often have a high energy density and high lipid content, along with low fibre content and high glycemic impact. So, enrichment with dietary fibre has the potential to improve the nutritional status of these popular products. In this study, the effects of enrichment with inulin-type fructans (ITFs), both before and after the extrusion process, on the physical characteristics, sensory acceptance, nutrient profile, and postprandial glycemic response of corn-snacks were assessed. The addition of 13.3% oligofructose-enriched inulin resulted in a snack with 4 g of ITFs/30 g serving size, having no effects on expansion but reducing the cutting force and increasing the fibre level by sevenfold compared to the control product. ITFs-enriched snacks were acceptable, with scores for flavour, crunchiness and overall liking of approximately 7.0 on a 9-point hedonic scale. The enrichment of snacks with 13.3% ITFs either before or after the extrusion process caused the same statistical reduction of the glycemic index (81 to 71) and glycemic load (21 to 14), yielding a product that combines high-quality and acceptance with a substantial supply of prebiotic dietary fibre and a medium glycemic load. Both approaches are promising alternatives for meeting the consumer demand for new healthy ready-to-eat-products.

J		Carabano, M. J.; Pineda-Quiroga, C.; Ugarte, E.; Diaz, C.; Ramon, M.							Genetic basis of thermotolerance in 2 local dairy sheep populations in the Iberian Peninsula.		Journal of Dairy Science					Sheep milk production in the Northern Mediterranean countries heavily relies on local breeds subject to selection schemes to improve milk production. Climate change may shift the range of thermal loads on the animals and challenge their adaptation to the new thermal gradient. The objective of this study was to characterize the genetic component of thermal tolerance of 2 local breeds from the Iberian Peninsula, Latxa and Manchega, belonging to different genetic types that have evolved under different climatic environments (Oceanic for Latxa and Continentalized Mediterranean for Manchega). A total of 79,243 and 2,388,853 test day monthly records of milk, fat and protein yields from 12,882 and 277,904 ewes of Latxa and Manchega breeds, respectively, along a 12-yr period, were matched with the value of the average temperature-humidity index (THI) on the day of milk recording of the closest weather station to the flocks. These data were used to fit individual reaction norms (Legendre polynomials) describing changes in yields along the THI gradient. Genetic values for thermal tolerance were obtained from the slopes of those reaction norms under cold or heat stress and variances and covariances between yield and thermal tolerance were derived from the (co) variance matrices of the polynomial random regression coefficients. Results showed differing patterns in the 2 breeds. The Latxa breed showed clearer signs of genotype by environment interaction than did Manchega. Estimated correlations between yields under extremes of cold and heat were always above 0.8 for Manchega and around 0.4 for Latxa for all traits. Estimates of correlations between comfort and thermal stress were again over 0.8 for Manchega and lower for the higher (hot end) values (down to 0.6) than for the lower (cold end) values (down to 0.84) of the THI gradient for Latxa, indicating greater thermal stress expected from high than from low temperatures in this breed. Substantial variability in thermal tolerance under the more extreme THI values was found in both breeds. Estimated genetic correlations between yield and thermal tolerance were close to 0 and 0.2 for Latxa and Manchega in the cold and down to -0.6 and -0.3 in the heat end, although small variation was observed for fat in Latxa. Estimated realized trends from the average estimated breeding value, by year of birth, showed a positive response for yields in both breeds [around 0.1 standard deviation (SD) unit], but a detrimental correlation for thermal tolerance (down to -0.03 SD units for heat tolerance in Latxa). These results can be used to design optimal selection strategies for sustainable improvement of productivity under a rising-temperature scenario associated with climate change.

J		Carames, E. T. dos S.; Baqueta, M. R.; Conceicao, D. A.; Pallone, J. A. L.							Near infrared spectroscopy and smartphone-based imaging as fast alternatives for the evaluation of the bioactive potential of freeze-dried acai.		Food Research International					The development of green analytical techniques for food industry quality control has become an important issue in the context of the fourth industrial revolution. In this sense, near infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and smartphone-based imaging (SBI) were applied to evaluate the bioactive potential of freeze-dried acai pulps. For this purpose, reference results of ninety-six samples were obtained by determining total anthocyanins (TAC), polyphenol content (TPC), and antioxidant capacity (DPPH, ORAC and TEAC) by traditional methods and correlated to NIR spectra and SBI to build predictive models based on partial square least (PLS) regression. In summary, the NIR-PLS models showed better performance for predicting the TAC, TPC and antioxidant capacity of studied samples; considering the parameters of merit, such as coefficient of determination (0.8) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) (2.2) compared to the SBI-PLS models (0.7 and lower 1.5, respectively). The better performance of NIR-PLS could be potentially justified by a higher sensitivity of the NIR equipment than the smartphone images. In conclusion, these results show that the proposed alternative methods are promising tools for the future context of the 4.0 food industry.

High-frequency focused ultrasound on quality traits of bovine Triceps brachii muscle.		Foods					This aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of high-frequency focused ultrasound (HFFU) on quality traits of bovine Triceps brachii. Four treatments (0, 10, 20, and 30 min) of HFFU (2 MHz and 1.5 W/cm2) were applied to bovine T. brachii muscle. Immediately after treatment, evaluations of color, pH, drip loss, water holding capacity, and shear force in meat were undertaken. The application of HFFU slightly decreased (p< 0.05) the redness of meat. In addition, a significant (p< 0.05) decrease in the shear force of meat was observed after the application of HFFU at 30 min. No effect (p> 0.05) was observed on other color parameters, drip loss, and water holding capacity of meat. Overall, HFFU improved beef tenderness without negative impacts on color, pH, drip loss, and water holding capacity of meat. HFFU offers the option of tenderizing specific muscles or anatomical regions of the beef carcass. These findings provide new insights into the potential application of ultrasound in meat processing. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Carballo, D.; Fernandez-Franzon, M.; Ferrer, E.; Pallares, N.; Berrada, H.							Dietary exposure to mycotoxins through alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages in Valencia, Spain.		Toxins					The present study investigated the presence of 30 mycotoxins in 110 beverage samples of beer, wine, cava, and cider purchased in Valencia (Spain). A validated method based on dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and chromatographic methods coupled with tandem mass spectrometry was applied. The method showed satisfactory recoveries ranging from 61 to 116% for the different beverages studied. The detection and quantification limits ranged from 0.03 to 2.34 g/L and 0.1 to 7.81 g/L, respectively. The results showed that beer samples were the most contaminated, even with concentrations ranging from 0.24 to 54.76 g/L. A significant presence of alternariol was found in wine, which reached concentrations up to 26.86 g/L. Patulin and ochratoxin A were the most frequently detected mycotoxins in cava and cider samples, with incidences of 40% and 26%, respectively. Ochratoxin A exceeded the maximum level set by the EU in one wine sample. The results obtained were statistically validated. The combined exposure was assessed by the sum of mycotoxin concentrations contaminating the same samples to provide information on the extent of dietary exposure to mycotoxins. No significant health risk to consumers was associated with the mycotoxin levels detected in the beverages tested. © 2021 by the authors.

Assessment of human exposure to deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and their metabolites biomarker in urine samples using LC-ESI-qTOF.		Toxins					Human are exposed to a wide range of mycotoxins through dietary food intake, including processed food. Even most of the mycotoxin exposure assessment studies are based on analysis of foodstuffs, and evaluation of dietary intake through food consumption patterns and human biomonitoring methods are rising as a reliable alternative to approach the individual exposures, overcoming the limitations of the indirect dietary assessment. In this study, human urine samples were analyzed, seeking the presence of deoxynivalenol (DON), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), and their metabolites. For this purpose, 40 urine samples from female and male adult residents in the city of Valencia (Spain) were evaluated by liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-qTOF) after salting-out liquid-liquid extraction. Analytical data showed that 72.5% of analyzed samples were contaminated by at least one mycotoxin at variable levels. The most prevalent mycotoxins were de-epoxy DON (DOM-1) (53%), ZEA (40%), and alpha-zearalenol (alphaZOL) (43%), while OTA was only detected in one sample. The mean concentrations in positive samples were DON (9.07 ng/mL), DOM-1 (20.28 ng/mL), ZEA (6.70 ng/mL), ZEA-14 glucoside (ZEA-14-Glc) (12.43 ng/mL), alphaZOL (27.44 ng/mL), alphaZOL-14 glucoside (alphaZOL-14-Glc) (12.84 ng/mL), and OTA (11.73 ng/mL). Finally, probable daily intakes (PDIs) were calculated and compared with the established tolerable daily intakes (TDIs) to estimate the potential risk of exposure to the studied mycotoxins. The calculated PDI was below the TDI value established for DON in both female and male adults, reaching a percentage up to 30%; however, this percentage increased up to 92% considering total DON (DON+ DOM-1). On the other hand, the PDI obtained for ZEA and its metabolites were higher than the TDI value fixed, but the low urine excretion rate (10%) considered should be highlighted. Finally, the PDI calculated in the detected positive sample for OTA exceeded the TDI value. The findings of the present study confirm the presence of the studied mycotoxins and their metabolites as some of the most prevalent in urine. © 2021 by the authors.

Banana pseudo-stem increases the water-holding capacity of minced pork batter and the oxidative stability of pork patties.		Foods					Banana pseudo-stem (BPS), which is rich in fibre and polyphenols, is a potential functional ingredient for the food industry. In this study, BPS was added at concentrations of 1.5, 3.0, and 4.5 g/kg to a minced pork batter to evaluate its performance as a filler and to pork burger patties to evaluate its performance as a natural antioxidant. The effects of BPS were compared with those of carrageenan and ascorbate, which are a conventional binder and antioxidant, respectively. The performance of BPS was similar to that of carrageenan in terms of the cooking yield and texture of the cooked batter. BPS reduced the brightness of fresh patties and appeared to reduce oxidative discolouration during the frozen storage of raw patties. Moreover, BPS reduced the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) during the refrigerated and frozen storage of cooked patties. A greater decrease in TBARS formation was observed with 4.5 g BPS/kg compared with 0.5 g sodium ascorbate/kg during refrigerated storage. In contrast to ascorbate, BPS promoted the presence of lipid-derived volatile compounds induced by thermal breakdown in the headspace of cooked patties. Nonetheless, this effect was reduced as the amount of BPS in the patties increased. In cooked minced meat products, BPS could increase cooking yields and lipid oxidative stability during storage and might result in a more intense flavour. © 2021 by the authors.

Occurrence of Fusarium spp. in maize grain harvested in Portugal and accumulation of related mycotoxins during storage.		Foods					Maize is an important worldwide commodity susceptible to fungal contamination in the field, at harvest, and during storage. This work aimed to determine the occurrence of Fusarium spp. In maize grains produced in the Tagus Valley region of Portugal and the levels of related mycotoxins in the 2018 harvest and during their storage for six months in barrels, mimicking silos conditions. Continuous monitoring of temperature, CO2, and relative humidity levels were done, as well as the concentration of mycotoxins were evaluated and correlated with the presence of Fusarium spp. F. verticillioides was identified as the predominant Fusarium species. Zearalenone, deoxynivalenol and toxin T2 were not found at harvest and after storage. Maize grains showed some variability in the levels of fumonisins (Fum B1 and Fum B2). At the harvest, fumonisin B1 ranged from 1297 to 2037 g/kg, and fumonisin B2 ranged from 411 to 618 g/kg. Fumonisins showed a tendency to increase (20 to 40%) during six months of storage. Although a correlation between the levels of fumonisins and the monitoring parameters was not established, CO2 levels may be used to predict fungal activity during storage. The composition of the fungal population during storage may predict the incidence of mycotoxins. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Tasting the Italian terroir through craft beer: quality and sensory assessment of cascade hops grown in central italy and derived monovarietal beers.		Foods					The present study aimed to chemically and sensorially characterize hop samples, cv Cascade, grown in two different Italian regions (Latium and Tuscany) as well as their derived beers by a multi analytical approach. Significant differences in bitter acid, oil and polyphenol content were observed for hop samples according to their origin. Gas chromatography-olfactometry analysis pointed out floral notes for Tuscany samples, where hops from Latium were characterized by spicy and resinous notes, correlated to the presence of sesquiterpenes. Differences in the molecular fingerprinting were also highlighted by Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. The differences found in the hops were reflected in the beers, which were clearly recognized as distinct by a sensory panel. Both beer samples were mainly characterized by six aroma compounds (linalool, geraniol and beta-damascenone, citronellol, 2-phenylethyl acetate, and 2-phenylethanol), three of which were potentially responsible for the geographic origin of the hops given their significantly different concentrations. © 2021 by the authors.

Toxins					The natural occurrence of six major ergot alkaloids, ergometrine, ergosine, ergotamine, ergocornine, ergokryptine and ergocristine, as well as their corresponding epimers, were investigated in 60 cereal samples (barley and wheat) from Algeria. Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and a QuEChERS extraction method were used for sample analysis. The results revealed that 12 out of 60 samples (20%) were contaminated with ergot alkaloids. Wheat was the most contaminated matrix, with an incidence of 26.7% (8 out of 30 samples). The concentration of total ergot alkaloids ranged from 17.8 to 53.9 g/kg for barley and from 3.66 to 76.0 mug/kg for wheat samples. Ergosine, ergokryptine and ergocristine showed the highest incidences in wheat, while ergometrine was the most common ergot in barley. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Evaluation of recombinant Kpkt cytotoxicity on HaCaT cells: further steps towards the biotechnological exploitation yeast killer toxins.		Foods					The soil yeast Tetrapisispora phaffii secretes a killer toxin, named Kpkt, that shows beta-glucanase activity and is lethal to wine spoilage yeasts belonging to Kloeckera/Hanseniaspora, Saccharomycodes and Zygosaccharomyces. When expressed in Komagataella phaffii, recombinant Kpkt displays a wider spectrum of action as compared to its native counterpart, being active on a vast array of wine yeasts and food-related bacteria. Here, to gather information on recombinant Kpkt cytotoxicity, lyophilized preparations of this toxin (LrKpkt) were obtained and tested on immortalized human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, a model for the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and esophagus. LrKpkt proved harmless to HaCaT cells at concentrations up to 36 AU/mL, which are largely above those required to kill food-related yeasts and bacteria in vitro (0.25-2 AU/mL). At higher concentrations, it showed a dose dependent effect that was comparable to that of the negative control and therefore could be ascribed to compounds, other than the toxin, occurring in the lyophilized preparations. Considering the dearth of studies regarding the effects of yeast killer toxins on human cell lines, these results represent a first mandatory step towards the evaluation the possible risks associated to human intake. Moreover, in accordance with that observed on Ceratitis capitata and Musca domestica, they support the lack of toxicity of this toxin on non-target eukaryotic models and corroborate the possible exploitation of killer toxins as natural antimicrobials in the food and beverages industries. © 2021 by the authors.

Liking for foods high in salt and fat is associated with a lower diet quality but liking for foods high in sugar is not - Results from the PREDISE study.		Food Quality and Preference					The research aimed at examining how liking for foods high in salt and fat and for foods high in sugar are associated with overall diet quality and how these associations differ according to individual characteristics (i.e., sex, age, education, income, nutrition knowledge, and energy reporting status) in French-speaking adults from the Province of Quebec, Canada. As part of the web-based cross-sectional PREDISE study, 1096 men and women completed online questionnaires. The Food Liking Questionnaire assessed reported liking for a variety of salty foods (high in salt and fat) and sweet foods (high in sugar and either high-fat or low-fat) on a scale from 1 to 9. The Canadian Healthy Eating Index (C-HEI) was computed based on data collected using 24-hour food recalls. Women (vs. Men) reported lower liking for salty foods (5.971.34 vs. 6.581.16, p< 0.0001) and for sweet foods (5.521.36 vs. 5.711.25, p=0.015). Multiple linear regressions showed that liking for sweet foods was not associated with C-HEI (B =-0.10, p=0.78). Given a significant sex interaction in the association between liking for salty foods and C-HEI (p interaction=0.0218), subsequent analyses were stratified by sex. Multiple linear regressions supported that liking for salty foods was more strongly inversely associated with C-HEI in men (B =-3.37, p< 0.0001) than women (B =-1.46, p=0.0035). In conclusion, a strong liking for salty foods may interfere with healthy eating, especially in men.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Since sugar reduction is a pillar of the international nutritional guideline, the food industry is constantly looking for new ingredients able to replace sugar technological functionality while satisfying the consumer's request for clean label. Based on corn (Zea mays) dextrin and seed coats of chickpeas (testa of Cicer arietinum seed), a fibre syrup was tested as bulking agent in cookies to reach 30% and 50% sugar reduction. Cookies were characterised for their physicochemical, rheological and sensorial attributes. Fibre syrup addition did neither hinder dough workability nor require changes in cookie production procedure. The use of the fibre syrup permitted to partially preserve the structural strength of cookies and increased their red colour index. Moreover, the fibre syrup use allowed to obtain sugar-reduced cookies qualified for "reduced in sugar" and "high in fibre" nutritional claims. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Carciochi, R. A.; Dieu, V.; Vauchel, P.; Pradal, D.; Dimitrov, K.							Reduction of environmental impacts of caffeine extraction from guarana by using ultrasound assistance.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Extraction of caffeine from guarana seeds was studied, comparing conventional extraction (CE) and ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). Preliminary studies permitted the selection of operating conditions for kinetics studies of both processes (water solvent, 10:1 mL/g liquid-solid ratio). UAE enabled strong enhancement of caffeine yields and process kinetics compared to CE at room temperature. At higher temperature (50 and 70 °C), the advantage of UAE over CE was still clear for extraction kinetics, but not for maximal extraction yield. Performing Life Cycle Assessment of both processes permitted to highlight ultrasound assistance ability to reduce extraction duration (up to 4.9 times), energy consumption (up to 6.2 times) and environmental impacts (more than twice for some impact categories) compared to CE at the same studied temperature. Environmental impacts of CE and UAE processes were studied in more detail using three different functional units. It contributed to a better knowledge of extraction process of caffeine from guarana seeds and allowed selecting the operating conditions maximizing benefits provided by ultrasound assistance. The environmental gains of UAE over CE at maximal temperature were relatively small when targeting a caffeine extraction yield close to the maximal attainable (at this temperature), but increased strongly for lower target yields.

J		Cardello, A. V.; Jaeger, S. R.							Questionnaires should be the default method in food-related emotion research.		Food Quality and Preference					This article is part of a virtual special issue (VSI) in Food Quality and Preference on emotion measurement with a particular focus on eating and drinking. We write in response to an invitation to comment on the opinion paper by Schouteten [FQAP, 2020,104122] titled "Are questionnaires the best way to measure emotions for food products and beverages? " Schouteten concludes that questionnaires, overall, are better suited to this task. We agree. In fact, we go one step further and propose that questionnaires and explicit approaches, in general, can be regarded as the default method for accessing and measuring emotional experiences. They already enjoy widespread use, and we suggest they remain the status quo until stronger arguments emerge in favour of using implicit methods. With technological advances, arguments for more regularly obtaining both explicit and implicit measures of food-related emotions may strengthen, and questionnaires may not remain the default forever. Our commentary is structured around the three questions raised by Schouteten regarding emotion measurement: i) what do we want to measure? ii) how do we measure it? and iii) what is the added value of the measurement?

In vitro gastrointestinal digestion and colonic fermentation of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.): phenolic compounds released and bioconverted by gut microbiota.		Food Chemistry					Two of the most important Mexican plant-foods are tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) and husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot.). In this study three objectives were followed: i) to evaluate the bioaccessible phenolic compounds (PC) in T and HT during upper gastrointestinal digestion, ii) to in vitro ferment the indigestible fractions of the samples to evaluate the short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) production, iii) the microbial metabolites, bioconverted PC and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) generated during the fermentation. Vanillic acid was the most bioaccessible PC and after 48 h, 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid was the most abundant microbial metabolite identified in both samples. The identification of VOCs belonging to terpenes (and derivatives) group in T and HT can be product of the microbial metabolism of carotenoids. The study shows new knowledge of the in vitro intestinal digestion and fermentation of T and HT final compounds with biological potential which should be evaluated in further studies.

Study of the impact of a dynamic in vitro model of the colon (TIM-2) in the phenolic composition of two Mexican sauces.		Food Research International					Husk tomato (Physalis ixocarpa Brot. ex. Horm) is mainly used in the preparation of many Mexican sauces due to its unique and slightly acidic flavor, both in raw and cooked forms. These sauces also usually contain Serrano hot pepper (Capsicum annuum L), onion (Allium cepa L.), garlic (Allium sativum L.), coriander (Coriandrum sativum L.) and salt. Mexican sauces are a pre-Hispanic staple food, yet there is scarce knowledge on the phenolic compounds (PC) that reach the colon bound to the indigestible fraction (IF) after intestinal digestion. Thus, the aim of the present work was to evaluate the indigestible fraction of two types of Mexican sauces made with cooked and raw husk tomato: cooked green sauce (CGS) and raw green sauce (RGS). IF of CGS and RGS were fermented in the in vitro model of the human colon (TIM-2) to investigate the PC bioconversion by the gut microbiota after 24,48 and 72 h. PC of the original sauces and their predigested fractions, as well as the formed metabolites were identified and monitored by HPLC-ESI-QToF-MS. Cooking husk tomato significantly increased the total indigestible fraction (TIF), mainly due to its insoluble indigestible fraction (IIF), and diminished PC. Flavonoids (flavonols and flavones) were the most abundant phenolic group in digested sauces followed by capsaicinoids (a characteristic group derived from hot pepper), hydroxycinnamic acids, and hydroxybenzoic acids. The metabolites 3-(rho-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid, 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid and 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were the most abundant colonic metabolites identified, which are thought to be derived from the biotransformation of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamates. These results are the first obtained on in vitro colonic fermentation of Mexican sauces and should be considered in future studies on the health effects related to consuming this staple food.

D'						Dynamics of the fermentation process and chemical profiling of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) wines obtained by different cultivar*yeast combinations.		Foods					Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is one of the historical tree crops in the Mediterranean region and is nowadays commercialized for its beneficial properties in the form of fruits, juice, jams and, in some East countries, as fermented juice (pomegranate wine). However, pomegranate wines are not established as a common beverage in Western countries. In this work, we produced pomegranate wines using two cultivars and two yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain Clos and S. cerevisiae ex-bayanus strain EC1118) with contrasting characteristics. A comprehensive chemical profile of the wines was obtained. Notable differences were observed in the function of the cultivars and the yeasts. Different cultivar*yeast combinations provided wines with clearly different chemical profiles and specific features in the patterns of organic acids, phenolics, and volatile compounds. This highlights the opportunity to obtain tailored pomegranate wines with desired chemical profiles and, consequently, sensory properties, through management optimization of pomegranate winemaking. In this view, pomegranate wines have the potential to become an established beverage in Western countries. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Microbial communities and volatile profile ofQueijo de AzeitaoPDO cheese, a traditional Mediterranean thistle-curdled cheese from Portugal.		Food Research International					The production of ovine or caprine milk cheeses with thistle rennet is a common practice in the Mediterranean basin. The aim of the present study was to obtain information on bacteria and yeast communities harboured by Queijo de Azeitao PDO cheese through viable counting and, for the first time, via metataxonomic analysis. Moreover, solid phase microextraction (SPME) technique was applied to characterize Queijo de Azeitao PDO cheese volatile compounds. Nine cheese samples were collected from three different artisan producers located in Portugal. The results of physico-chemical analyses showed significant differences between producers, with mean values ranging from 5.40 0.25 (Producer 1) to 6.00 0.22 (Producer 2). As for TTA, Producer 1 showed the highest mean value attesting at 18.04 6.57mL of 0.1M NaOH used to reach pH 8.3. Regarding lactic acid concentration, Producer 1 showed the highest mean value attesting at 0.488 0.106g 100g-1, whereas, for acetic acid, no significant differences were evidenced among producers with values comprised between 0.141 0.021g 100g-1 and 0.245 0.016g 100g-1. No significant differences were observed between overall mean values of the three producers for viable counts of presumptive lactococci, thermophilic cocci, presumptive lactobacilli, thermophilic lactobacilli and total mesophilic aerobes with values in the order of 7-8 log cfu g-1. Moreover, no significant differences were evidenced for viable counts of coagulase-negative cocci, enterococci, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae. As for eumycetes, cheeses from Producer 1 showed the lowest mean value (2.78 2.42 log cfu g-1) in respect with values detected in cheeses from Producer 2 and 3. Concerning microbiota and mycobiota of the analyzed cheeses, the alpha diversity index did not show any significant difference between the three producers in terms of composition and complexity of the microbial population. A simple composition was apparently shared by the three producers, whose cheese manufactures were dominated by the presence of Leuconostoc mesenteroides (37% of the relative frequency in average), Lactococcus lactis (29%), Lacticaseibacillus zeae (4.7%), Lentilactobacillus kefiri (4.4%), Serratia spp. (3.5%), Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (2.7%), and Latilactobacillus sakei (2.5%). The mycobiota composition showed the neat dominance of Yarrowia lipolytica (46.7% of the relative frequency in average), followed by Candida ethanolica (13.6%), Kurtzmaniella zeylanoides (9.4%), Geotrichum candidum (8.8%), Galactomyces geotrichum (8.7%), Kluyveromyces lactis (3.5%), and Geotrichum silvicola (2.7%). The volatile profile analysis allowed 24 different compounds to be identified: 7 acids, 7 esters, 4 alcohols, 3 ketones, 2 aromatic hydrocarbons, and 1 aldehyde. The most represented volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were 2-butanone, butanoic acid and hexanoic acid. A positive correlation between Len. Kefiri and hexanoic acid and isopentyl isobutyrate was observed (P<0.05), whereas Y. lipolytica displayed the highest number of positive correlations with 3-methyl-butanal, 2-pentanone and 2-pentanol (P<0.05). To the authors' knowledge, this is the very first detection of Len. Kefiri in a raw ewe's milk cheese coagulated with vegetable rennet. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					The increase in food intolerances, allergies, and food-based lifestyle choices has dramatically increased the consumer demand for healthy foods characterized by pleasant sensory traits. In such a context, innovative cereal-based beverages are characterized by high nutritional value, pleasant palatability, and potential healthy properties. In the present study, a pool of 23 lactic acid bacteria strains was preliminary assayed as monocultures for the fermentation of three ad hoc formulated cereal-(red rice and barley) and pseudocereal (buckwheat)-based substrates. Eight strains with the best performance in terms of acidification rate were selected for the formulation of three multiple strain cultures to be further exploited for the manufacture of laboratory-scale prototypes of fermented beverages. The compositional and microbiological features of the three experimental beverages highlighted their high biological value for further exploitation. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Despite being considered a climate-resilient crop, sorghum is still underutilized in food processing because of the limited starch and protein functionality. For this reason, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of sprouting time on sorghum functional properties and the possibility to exploit sprouted sorghum in bread making. In this context, red sorghum was sprouted for 24, 36, 48, 72, and 96 h at 27 °C. Sprouting time did not strongly affect the sorghum composition in terms of total starch, fiber, and protein contents. On the other hand, the developed proteolytic activity had a positive effect on oil-absorption capacity, pasting, and gelation properties. Conversely, the increased alpha-amylase activity in sprouted samples (≥36 h) altered starch functionality. As regards sorghum-enriched bread, the blends containing 48 h-sprouted sorghum showed high specific volume and low crumb firmness. In addition, enrichment in sprouted sorghum increased both the in vitro protein digestibility and the slowly digestible starch fraction of bread. Overall, this study showed that 48 h-sprouted sorghum enhanced the bread-making performance of wheat-based products. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					Xylitol, a sugar substitute, presents considerable amount of benefits for both product applications and consumer health, which make it a high value product for various industries. The production of xylitol through yeast fermentation is an alternative that suits sustainable development, as it can use agro-industrial byproducts, and might come to reach a lower production price than the current method in use once its technology is further developed. While there is extensive research in the process up to the synthesis of xylitol, the purification process to attain the final product is still not well consolidated. In the present work, tests were performed to assess the capacity of purification of xylitol containing fermented media by activated carbon in fixed bed columns. Response surface methodology with pulse input was utilized to investigate how the process responses vary when temperature, superficial velocity and injection volume are altered, and to define which conditions maximize productivity and minimizes xylitol retention while maintaining satisfactory levels of clarification. The best condition found (T=70 °C, vs=1.5 cm/min, Vi=3 mL) was then applied to a new purification test with continuous feeding of fermented media. The process presented as a potential alternative for biotechnological xylitol purification step with efficacy in separating proteins (PFprotein=18.0), colored compounds (reducing more than 99% of absorbance at 420 nm and 560 nm) and ethanol (PFethanol=20.4) with a productivity of 36.8 g L-1 h-1 and RCxylitol=31.1%.

Antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of ethyl acetate extracts of chub mackerel (Scomber colias): a thorough seasonal evaluation.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The seasonal variation of key bioactivities in ethyl acetate extracts of chub mackerel (Scomber colias), an underutilised fish species, was evaluated through a complete monthly sampling. The phenolic content had a seasonal variation, ranging from 395 mg GAE/100 g ww (February) to 3406 mg GAE/100 g ww (October). Ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) increased from 1.30.4 mumol Fe2+ Eq/g ww (January) to 10.30.1 mumol Fe2+ Eq/g ww (September). ABTS had no antioxidant activity between June and December, being the highest value in February, 64.36.3 mumol Trolox Eq/100 g ww. For phenolic content and FRAP, there was a strong seasonality, which was similar to that of the lipid content. Therefore, correlations were high, being R2 0.95 for lipid vs. Phenolic contents. Anti-inflammatory activity did not show large changes throughout most part of the year, remaining high in the 70-80% of COX-2 inhibition. This finding and the seasonality of the antioxidant properties warrant further research. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Effect of protein level and methionine supplementation on dairy cows during the transition period.		Journal of Dairy Science					Cows experience a significant negative protein balance during the first 30 d of lactation. Given the functional effects of AA on health, especially in challenging periods such as calving, higher levels of protein and specific AA in the diet may act to improve health and feed intake. The response of dairy cows to 3 protein supplementation strategies during the transition period and through the first 45 d in milk was evaluated. The final data set had 39 Holstein cows blocked based on parity (primiparous vs. Multiparous) and expected calving and randomly assigned within each block to one of 3 dietary treatments: low protein (LP), high protein (HP), or high protein plus rumen-protected methionine (HPM). Treatments were offered from d-185 to 45 d relative to parturition. Pre- and postpartum diets were formulated for high metabolizable protein (MP) supply from soybean meal, and HP and HPM provided higher MP balance than LP. Preplanned contrasts were LP versus HP+HPM and HP versus HPM. Significance was declared at P≤0.05 and trends at 0.05 < P≤0.10. Cows fed HP and HPM had greater fry matter intake (DMI) prepartum than LP (+2 kg/d), and there was a trend for greater DMI with HPM than with HP (+1.6 kg/d). Body weight and condition score before and after calving did not differ among treatments. High protein (HP and HPM) tended to increase milk yield during the first 45 d of lactation (+1.75 kg/d), increased milk lactose content and urea-N in milk and plasma, tended to increase blood BHB 14 d postpartum, and tended to reduce milk/DMI compared with LP. Blood concentrations of calcium at calving and of glucose, and nonesterified fatty acids pre-and postpartum did not differ. High protein induced lower concentration of plasma IL-1 at calving and lowered blood lymphocytes 21 d postpartum, suggestive of a reduced inflammatory status compared with LP. The concentrations of IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and other hemogram variables did not differ among treatments. Addition of rumen-protected methionine to the HP diet did not alter milk yield but increased fat and total solids concentrations. The rumen-protected methionine had no effect on blood metabolites and immunity markers, with the exception of increased pre-partum insulin concentrations. The data indicate that dairy cows around calving respond positively to an increase in the supply of MP and to rumen-protected methionine supplementation of the HP diet by increasing intake and improving immune status.

Cross-contamination events of Campylobacter spp. in domestic kitchens associated with consumer handling practices of raw poultry.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Contaminated poultry is the major vehicle for consumer's exposure to Campylobacter. This study aimed to perceive potential cross-contamination events during preparation of raw poultry that can contribute to the spread of Campylobacter spp. In domestic kitchen environments and to understand consumers' meanings and justifications on preparation of a poultry dish at home. A total of 18 households were visited to observe consumers preparing a recipe that included poultry. Poultry samples and swabs from the kitchen surfaces and utensils, such as kitchen cloth, hand towel, sponge, cutting boards and the sink, were collected before and after food preparation and tested for the presence of Campylobacter spp. Genotypic characterization of 72 Campylobacter spp. Isolates was carried out through Pulse-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Fourteen chicken samples were contaminated with Campylobacter spp. (77.8%). Twelve consumers (66.6%) washed the chicken meat under running tap water and eight (44.4%) used cutting boards. Also, only five consumers washed their hands properly prior to or during meal preparation. Cross-contamination events were detected in four kitchens, between the raw chicken and two cutting boards, two sinks and one kitchen cloth. The poultry samples presented different levels of contamination (< 4.0*101 CFU/g to 2.2*103 CFU/g), being some poultry with lower Campylobacter loads the origin of three cross-contamination events during food preparation. Both C. jejuni and C. coli were recovered. Molecular typing by PFGE showed a high diversity among the isolates. There were different explanations for the practice of cleaning and rinsing chicken, but, in general, it is an habit linked to what they have learned from their families. These results highlight the potential for the dissemination of Campylobacter strains in the domestic environment through the preparation of chicken meat and the need to raise awareness among consumers for an appropriate handling of raw poultry in order to decrease the risk of campylobacteriosis.

J		Cardoso, P. G.; Goncalves, O.; Carvalho, M. F.; Ozorio, R.; Vaz-Pires, P.							Seasonal evaluation of freshness profile of commercially important fish species.		Foods					Freshness is considered one of the most important parameters to judge the quality of most fish products. In the current study, the seasonality effect on the freshness profile of different economic fish species was evaluated for the first time, using three different approaches (sensory: Quality Index Method (QIM) and European (EC) Scheme; physical: Torrymeter (TRM) values; and microbiological analyses: Total Viable Counts (TVC) and degradative bacteria). Over a year, individuals of farmed fish Sparus aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax, as well as the wild fish Trachurus trachurus, Scomber colias, and Sardina pilchardus, were sampled seasonally for the evaluation of their freshness profile over 10 days on ice. In general, data showed an increase in QIM values, a decline in TRM, and an increase of spoilage bacteria throughout the storage time, revealing a clear temporal degradation of the quality of the fish. Additionally, some signs of seasonality effect could only be observed for some species. For example, the seabass D. labrax showed lower numbers of degradative bacteria in winter than in the other seasons, suggesting a high potential to be marketed in a fresher condition, especially during that season. On the other hand, S. colias showed higher freshness scores (i.e., higher TRM values in spring and autumn and lower numbers of bacteria in summer) from spring to autumn. However, from the five studied species, S. colias presented the lowest freshness values, indicating a higher fragility of this species. This information is extremely relevant for consumers and retailers that want to invest in higher quality products, as they would thus be able to choose certain species in detriment of others. Additionally, obtained data showed that farmed species reached day 10 of storage time with lower values of QIM and microbial counts (cfu), as well as higher values of TRM, in relation to wild species. These results reinforce the idea that farmed fish can, under proper conditions, present high quality/freshness profile. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Food & Function					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of green and black tea kombuchas consumption on adiposity, lipid and glucose metabolism, liver steatosis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in Wistar rats fed a high-fat high-fructose (HFHF) diet. Wistar rats, after 8 weeks to induce metabolic alterations, were divided into an AIN-93M control group, HFHF control group, green tea kombucha + HFHF diet (GTK group), and black tea kombucha + HFHF diet (BTK group), for 10 weeks. The kombuchas improved glucose metabolism, plasma total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase activity, and decreased nitric oxide concentration. Moreover, both kombuchas reduced systemic inflammation by decreasing the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), reduced the total adipose tissue and blood triglyceride, and reverted liver steatosis (from grade 2 to 1), besides the modulation of genes related to adipogenesis and beta-oxidation. Therefore, kombuchas from green and black teas have bioactive properties that can help control metabolic alterations induced by the HFHF diet. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Combined effects of irradiation and storage time on the nutritional and chemical parameters of dried Agaricus bisporus Portobello mushroom flour.		Journal of Food Science					Portobello variety of Agaricus bisporus mushrooms, appreciated for its taste, makes it desirable to be eaten fresh and also as flour in soups and gravies. Gamma and electron-beam radiation at four doses (1, 2, 5, and 10 kGy) were used to analyze its preservation effect on Portobello mushroom flour. A proximate analysis, as well as the impact on fatty acids, tocopherols, soluble sugars, organic acids, and ergosterol profiles, were performed every 3 months, during a storage period of 1 year. Gamma rays preserved mannitol (most abundant soluble sugar) over the 12 months, while electron beam radiation preserved organic acids. No significant changes were sought for any radiation type, and the slight changes extracted from the estimated marginal means reveal a tendency for irradiation as having preserving effects of nutrients and other important molecules. Thus, both irradiation types, up to 10 kGy are suitable for preservation of A. bisporus Portobello flour. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Cardoso, V. G. K.; Poppi, R. J.							Cleaner and faster method to detect adulteration in cassava starch using Raman spectroscopy and one-class support vector machine.		Food Control					Due to food adulteration concerns, analytical assays are routinely performed in labs to evaluate and ensure food quality control. However, classical analytical methods used to acquire reliable results are lengthy and costly. Therefore, we aim to propose a new approach to detect adulterants in cassava starch in a clean, green, cheap, and quick way. Raman spectroscopy meets all these requirements and presents great potential to perform such routine analyses. Data treatment is also an important step in authentication problems, and we propose the use of one-class models to do so. One-class support vector machine (OC-SVM) and soft independent modelling by class analogy (SIMCA) were the two approaches to one-class classifiers assessed in this study. Cassava starch samples were modified in the lab with adulteration ranging from 0.5 to 50%, with adulterants such as wheat flour, sodium bicarbonate, and others. The two chemometric models were statistically compared and OC-SVM was found to outperform SIMCA, reaching higher values of sensitivity (87.1%), specificity (86.8%), and accuracy (86.9%) in the prediction of known data samples. This better performance also resulted in the possibility of detecting adulterations over 2% by OC-SVM, compared to only 5% by SIMCA.

Stability of oregano essential oil encapsulated in double (w/o/w) emulsions prepared with mechanical or high-pressure homogenization and its effect in Aspergillus niger inhibition.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					High-pressure homogenization and mechanical homogenization were used for the production of water-in-oil primary emulsions (PE) containing oregano essential oil. Different PE concentrations and homogenization parameters were tested during the production of water-in-oil-in-water (W/O/W) double emulsions to assess their effect on emulsion stability during 25 days of storage by determining emulsion droplet size and creaming; the antifungal activity of W/O/W emulsions against Aspergillus niger was evaluated. The smallest droplet sizes of W/O/W emulsions were obtained with a mechanical homogenization velocity of 5,800 rpm, formulated with a PE concentration of 20%. The creaming behavior of emulsions during storage followed a second-order kinetic starting on day 1, presenting maximum values from 15% to 35% and creaming rates from 3.16%/day to 7.3%/day. The antifungal activity of W/O/W emulsions against A. niger was demonstrated. Binary logistic regression was used to predict A. niger inhibition, resulting in being dependent on the creaming behavior of the emulsions. Practical applications. Double emulsions are usually employed to protect and release bioactive compounds in a continuous manner. In this work, oregano essential oil (OEO) was encapsulated in W/O/W double emulsions aiming to reach its gradual release toward the in vitro inhibition of Aspergillus niger, which is usually found in vegetables. Results. Obtained let know that W/O/W emulsions with different droplet sizes can be obtained using mechanical or high-pressure homogenization in the preparation of W/O emulsions. The droplet size of the W/O/W emulsions determines their creaming rate affecting the antifungal activity of the encapsulated OEO. The antifungal activity can be evaluated by applying a probabilistic model on mold survival during storage. These data allow predicting the in vitro successful inhibition performance of OEO encapsulated in W/O/W emulsions against A. niger. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

B. de							Exploratory analysis of the presence of 14 carbonyl compounds in bottled mineral water in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers.		Food Chemistry					Carbonyl compounds (CCs) can migrate from bottles to mineral water because of plastic degradation. An exploratory analysis of the presence a significant number of CCs (14) in bottled mineral water with and without gas in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) containers was performed using ultra-fast liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UFLC-MS). The data from the analysis was submitted to chemometric treatment (principal component analysis, PCA). Formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and benzaldehyde were found in all samples (0.07-125 ng mL-1). Acrolein and acetone were present in 81% and 75% of the samples, respectively. The concentration of acrolein in carbonated water was up to 3.8 times greater than that measured in non-carbonated water (0.07-0.440.01 ng mL-1). PCA analysis showed that gasification can influence the composition of CCs present in mineral water and that the plastic material of the bottles is a likely source of CCs. In addition, benzaldehyde levels may be associated with the use of recycled materials.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this work was to evaluate the performance of lactase encapsulated in pectin-based hydrogels during lactose hydrolysis reactions. Pectin-based hydrogel and pectin-based composite hydrogel containing pine fiber were synthesized by chemical cross-linking. Lactase was encapsulated in both hydrogels by adsorption. Lactose hydrolysis experiments were conducted by immersing encapsulated lactase in standard lactose solutions, varying pH and temperature. The formed glucose concentrations were determined by UV-vis spectrophotometry, using an enzymatic-colorimetric method. The lactase encapsulation, catalytic activity, lactose hydrolysis and lactase release were affected by the drying of the hydrogel (oven or freeze-drying), pH and temperature variation of the aqueous lactose solution and pine fiber content in the polymer network. The encapsulation efficiencies of lyophilized hydrogels containing 0, 5 and 10% of pine fiber were 69.04 1.19, 69.57 0.78 and 71.10 0.35%, respectively. Slightly lower values were found for air-dried hydrogels. The relative catalytic activities of lactase encapsulated in the hydrogels containing 0, 5 and 10% of pine fiber were, respectively, 52.85 0.97, 56.26 1.07 and 57.27 1.18% (w/w) after three successive cycles of lactose hydrolysis in UHT-milk. Overall, pectin-based hydrogels are potential solid supports for preserving the lactase activity during lactose hydrolysis reactions. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Caridi, A.; Romeo, R.; Bruno, A. de; Masaneo, C.; Poiana, M.							Long-term effects of different starter yeasts on colour and natural antioxidant power of red wines.		European Food Research and Technology					Eighty-seven red wines produced from red grapes of the grape variety Gaglioppo from the Calabria region (vintage 2009) were analysed by standard methods after 4 and 120 months of ageing. So, a total of 29 selected starters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae-3 wild type, 12 monoclonal cultures, and 14 hybrids-inoculated in triplicate were studied for their effects on colour and natural antioxidant power keeping of red wine. Wine ageing decreased the red component, the colour intensity, and the DPPH values while the colour hue values increased. This research has shown that the evolution of wine ageing is affected in a very different way by the starter yeast used and has allowed choosing the best yeast strain useful to produce red wine able to endure very long-time ageing, until 10 years. ©The Author(s) 2021.

J		Carletto, C.; Maluccio, J. A.; Shrestha, S. M.; Stewart, M. F.							Migration, economic crisis and child growth in rural Guatemala: insights from the Great Recession.		Food Policy					Migration has been demonstrated by various studies to be closely linked to improvements in individual- and household-level outcomes. In this paper, rather than examining the effects of migration, we explore whether an economic shock in United States affected migrant households in rural Guatemala. Treating the Great Recession as a natural experiment affecting migrant and non-migrant households differently, we put the spotlight on the effect of the shock on child anthropometry, including longer-term indicators of height-for-age z-scores (HAZ). Panel data on children, and multiple children in households enable both double- and triple-difference estimation. In relative terms, migrant households fared much worse than non-migrant households over the period. Large advantages in child anthropometric status for the youngest children in migrant households in 2008, just prior to the crisis, were substantially diminished four years later. The findings underscore the possible fragility of the benefits of migration, particularly in the face of a substantial economic shock, and point to the potential importance of deepening social safety nets.

Chemical characterization of Echium plantagineum seed oil obtained by three methods of extraction.		Journal of Food Science					Echium seed oil has been considered an important alternative source of omega 3 fatty acids (n-3 FA) for human consumption. Considering the oxidative instability of n-3 FA richer oils, the objective of this study was to determine the chemical and sensory parameters of the oil obtained from Echium plantagineum seeds obtained by three extraction methods (hydraulic press: HYD; continuous screw press: PRESS; and solvent technique: SOLV). Stearidonic acid (C18:4, n3), the most important n-3 FA present in the oil, changed from 12.5% to 12.7%. Regarding the minor compounds, PRESS sample showed the highest concentration of gamma-tocopherol (782.24 mg/kg oil), while SOLV samples presented the highest amount of beta-sitosterol (73.46 mg/100 g) with no difference of campesterol concentration (159.56 mg/100 g) among the samples. Higher values of total phenolics (19.65 mg GAE/kg oil) and beta-carotene (34.83 mg/kg oil) were also found in the SOLV samples, suggesting the influence of hexane in the extraction of these bioactive compounds. High resolution mass spectrometry identified caffeic acid and its derivatives as the main phenolic compounds present in the echium oil. PRESS sample showed the best oxidative stability as measured by PV (0.61 mmol/kg oil) and malondialdehyde (173.13 mol), probably due to faster time of processing compared to HYD and SOLV samples. Our data showed that the extraction method changed the chemical composition of the minor compounds in the echium oil, but these alterations did not reduce its nutritional quality or sensory acceptability. Practical Application. Echium oil represents a great potential source of omega 3 fatty acids, but there is not enough information about its oxidative stability and chemical composition, especially toward minor compounds. Our study characterizes echium oil composition obtained from three extraction methods, contributing to amplify the technical information about this important alternative oil for human consumption. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists .

J		Carlos, K. S.; Jager, L. S. de; Begley, T. H.							Determination of phthalate concentrations in paper-based fast food packaging available on the U.S. market.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Phthalates are one of many chemical compounds that are used as plasticisers. Packaging can transfer plasticisers to the surfaces of foods or other materials. A recent study suggested a link between fast food consumption and increased urine phthalate metabolites even though phthalates are most commonly found in food contact materials made of PVC while fast food packaging is most commonly composed of paper and paper board. Phthalates in PVC are usually present in percent concentrations. In non-PVC food contact materials, such as paper or paperboard, the concentrations, if any, are expected to be significantly lower which can greatly impact the analytical method used for their determination. Due to the widespread use of plasticised PVC in many commercial applications, background concentrations of phthalates are a concern for trace concentration analyses and background contamination must be avoided when performing these analyses. A glassware cleaning method was developed and a solvent extraction with dichloromethane and hexane was used to extract phthalates from paper-based food packaging. The extracts were then analysed using a GC-MS/MS. The minimum reporting concentrations for the method were determined to be 0.10-0.40 g/g depending on the phthalate investigated. Phthalate concentrations in several different non-PVC printed and unprinted packaging are presented. Of the 54 packaging samples tested, 10 samples contained no reportable concentrations of any of the 6 phthalates investigated. Of those that were reportable, all measured lower than 10 g/g and in fact, most had concentrations less than 1 g/g. These data demonstrate that phthalates from fast food packaging do not significantly contribute to overall consumer exposure. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	3	501	512	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1859623					FSTA:2021-07-Fe1863

Co-encapsulation of anthocyanins extracted from grape skins (Vitis vinifera var. Syrah) and alpha-tocopherol via spray drying.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study sought to characterize the microparticles obtained from the co-encapsulation of anthocyanins extracted from red grape skins and alpha-tocopherol via spray drying. Briefly, grape skin extract was homogenized with gum arabic, Tween 80, and different concentrations of alpha-tocopherol. Anthocyanin content, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content, alpha-tocopherol concentration, color, hygroscopicity, morphology, and the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results of each treatment were analyzed. The highest concentration of alpha-tocopherol led to the highest total phenolic content, and the lowest hygroscopicity and anthocyanin content. Intermediate concentrations of alpha-tocopherol resulted in an increased incidence of microparticles with smooth surface and elevated antioxidant activity. The FTIR spectra verified the efficacy of the process, showing characteristic bands of the co-encapsulated compounds. Overall, alpha-tocopherol concentrations between 1.5% and 2.0% (w/w) led to good powder properties (hygroscopicity, total phenolic content and antioxidant activity), generating further research interest to evaluate the use of alpha-tocopherol in foods. Practical applications. The development of products containing bioactive compounds that offer benefits to human health have gained a lot of attention. In this study, the co-encapsulation of anthocyanins extracted from grape skin and alpha-tocopherol by spray drying proved to be interesting as an interaction occurred between compounds, which enables the attainment of an added-value natural product, representing an innovation in the food sector. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16038					FSTA:2022-04-Jg4665

Microparticles of yellow-orange cactus pear pulp (Opuntia ficus-indica) with cladode mucilage and maltodextrin as a food coloring in yogurt.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					There is an increasing interest in the use of natural food colorants to substitute synthetic dyes that are health harmful. In this study, encapsulation conditions of yellow-orange cactus pear Opuntia ficus-indica pulp (P), were determined using maltodextrin (MD) as the encapsulating agent (EA). The effect of three encapsulating agents (cactus mucilage (M), MD, and mucilage-maltodextrin (M+MD) blend) on microparticle's characteristics, stability, and performance as a colorant in yogurt was assessed at optimal conditions determined by Response Surface Methodology. Optimal conditions for encapsulation with MD were inlet air temperature 150 °C and a 3:1 ratio, where pulp: encapsulating agent ratio had more influence than the temperature in the yield during encapsulation. Indicaxanthin encapsulation efficiency and yield were 100% and 51.2% (P-MD), 87% and 7% (P-M), and 93% and 11% (P-M+MD), respectively. P-MD system showed higher indicaxanthin stability and less color change stored at 60 °C. However, P-MD and P-M+MD microparticles were successfully tested as colorants in yogurt, and both colorants showed similar performance and stability (over 80% indicaxanthin retention). Cactus cladode mucilage with the addition of maltodextrin could be the encapsulating agent for yellow-orange cactus pear pulp, thus providing pigment protection as a yellow colorant for yogurt.

Curing and low-temperature combined post-harvest storage enhances anthocyanin biosynthesis in blood oranges.		Food Chemistry					Anthocyanins are pigments present in blood oranges which can be enriched by post-harvest cold storage. Additionally, citrus fruits contain appreciable levels of other flavonoids, whose content increases under post-harvest heat treatments. Here, we investigated the effects of curing (37 °C for 3 days) and storage at low-temperature (9 °C) during 15,30 and 45 days on accumulation of anthocyanins and other flavonoids in Moro and Sanguinelli Polidori blood oranges (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck). Cured fruits reached up to 191.41.4 mg/L of anthocyanins in their juice after cold storage and a 3-fold enrichment of other flavonoids such as flavones and flavanones, compared to 85.73.3 mg/L anthocyanins from fruits with cold storage alone. Concomitantly, qPCR analysis showed that curing enhanced upregulation of the main structural and transcription factor genes regulating the flavonoid pathway. GC-MS analysis showed that no unpleasant compounds were generated in the cured plus cold-stored juice volatilome. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Reliability and validity of a new colour-changing test food with an acid-base reaction for the clinical assessment of masticatory performance.		Food & Function					The aim of this study was to determine the reliability and validity of a new test food for the clinical assessment of masticatory performance. The test food had two overlapping acidic/basic halves. Ten dentate subjects chewed one unit for 10-100 cycles. One subject chewed ten units for the same number of cycles. Differences in the L*, a* and b* colour axes were determined before and after chewing by ANOVA. Colour guides were created based on the values of these axes and matched with the number of cycles. The reliability of the guides was evaluated using 30 images, where three examiners indicated the number of cycles in which the colour closest to that of a chewed material was found. The data were contrasted with the real values of the guides to determine the validity (Kappa coefficients). The equivalence of the guides with the median particle size (X50) was determined using equidimensional curves. The test food progressively changed from green to pink during chewing. As the number of cycles increased, the a* values increased and the b* values decreased (p< 0.05). Overall, the guides showed a Kappa value >0.8 for the intra-examiner and inter-examiner reliability and the validity comparisons. The a* and X50 values were inversely proportional to each other, and the b* values showed a direct relationship with the X50 values. The L* values did not show correspondence. The new test food showed high reliability and validity for the assessment of masticatory performance through clinical colour guides matched with the number of cycles and X50. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.		; Farago, Paulo Vitor/B-7439-2015	Carneiro, Dominique Ellen/0000-0002-4865-5394; Farago, Paulo Vitor/0000-0002-9934-4027							2021	12	20	10071	10082	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01782a					FSTA:2022-02-Aj2176

Journal of Dairy Research					The work reported in this paper addresses the iodine nutritional deficiency that still affects a large number of people. For this purpose, we analyzed the possibility to use, as iodine vehicle, a hard typical ewe cheese, called Canestrato d'Abruzzo, derived from milk of ewes fed with an iodine-fortified diet. Both in the milk and the cheese of these animals, the iodine level was higher than that measured in sheep with a normal diet. An increase in the lactoferrin and iron content was evident in the whey derived from milk of the iodine group. Furthermore, in derived cheese, the caseins seemed more efficiently transformed in small peptides making the product more digestible and, for this reason, particularly suitable for feeding the elderly.

Strong effect of Penicillium roqueforti populations on volatile and metabolic compounds responsible for aromas, flavor and texture in blue cheeses.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Studies of food microorganism domestication can provide important insight into adaptation mechanisms and lead to commercial applications. Penicillium roqueforti is a fungus with four genetically differentiated populations, two of which were independently domesticated for blue cheese-making, with the other two populations thriving in other environments. Most blue cheeses are made with strains from a single P. roqueforti population, whereas Roquefort cheeses are inoculated with strains from a second population. We made blue cheeses in accordance with the production specifications for Roquefort-type cheeses, inoculating each cheese with a single P. roqueforti strain, using a total of three strains from each of the four populations. We investigated differences between the cheeses made with the strains from the four P. roqueforti populations, in terms of the induced flora, the proportion of blue color, water activity and the identity and abundance of aqueous and organic metabolites as proxies for proteolysis and lipolysis as well as volatile compounds responsible for flavor and aroma. We found that the population-of-origin of the P. roqueforti strains used for inoculation had a minor impact on bacterial diversity and no effect on the abundance of the main microorganism. The cheeses produced with P. roqueforti strains from cheese populations had a higher percentage of blue area and a higher abundance of the volatile compounds typical of blue cheeses, such as methyl ketones and secondary alcohols. In particular, the Roquefort strains produced higher amounts of these aromatic compounds, partly due to more efficient proteolysis and lipolysis. The Roquefort strains also led to cheeses with a lower water availability, an important feature for preventing spoilage in blue cheeses, which is subject to controls for the sale of Roquefort cheese. The typical appearance and flavors of blue cheeses thus result from human selection on P. roqueforti, leading to the acquisition of specific features by the two cheese populations. These findings have important implications for our understanding of adaptation and domestication, and for cheese improvement.

J		Carp, O. E.; Moraru, A.; Pinteala, M.; Arvinte, A.							Electrochemical behaviour of piperine. Comparison with control antioxidants.		Food Chemistry					Piperine, as the most abundant alkaloid in pepper, gained a lot of attention for possible antioxidant and therapeutic properties. Electrochemical techniques were applied to widely evaluate the redox behavior of piperine by comparison to that of well-known antioxidants: ascorbic acid, protocatechuic acid, syringic acid, tyrosine and capsaicin used as controls. Also, electrochemistry was involved in an innovative way to investigate the potential antioxidant properties of piperine combined with different in vitro peroxidation and reducing assays: (i) 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl free radical (DPPH) scavenging; (ii) 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinyl-1-oxy (TEMPO) scavenging; (iii) ferric ions (Fe3+) reducing power; (iv) hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenging. Results show that piperine readily reacts with highly oxidizing radicals and bind redox-active metal ions in a similar manner as antioxidants used as model. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Complex coacervation of pea protein isolate and tragacanth gum: comparative study with commercial polysaccharides.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The ability of pea protein isolates (PPI) to form complex coacervates with tragacanth gum was investigated. The coacervate formation was structurally compared to three other PPI-polysaccharide interaction models: arabic gum and sodium alginate (known to form coacervates with PPI) and tara gum, a galactomannan. The effects of the pH and protein/polysaccharide ratio were mainly investigated using turbidity and zeta potential measurements. Regarding the pH of soluble complex formation, the pH of complex coacervates increased with the increase in protein-anionic polysaccharide mixture ratio. SEM images revealed the ability of the spray-drying process to form spherical particles of pea protein-polysaccharide complexes. The specificity of the microparticle surface was protein-dependent. FTIR analyses of coacervates showed the electrostatic interaction between the PPI and the polysaccharides. The results showed that tragacanth gum could be used as an alternative to gum arabic to form complex coacervates with PPI based on zeta potential measurements and coacervation yield studies.

Bio-based films prepared with apple pomace: volatiles compound composition and mechanical, antioxidant and antibacterial properties.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The valorisation of agro-industrial by-products can be used as an alternative source for producing healthy food ingredients and materials. The volatile profile measured by headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, mechanical, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of biodegradable cassava starch film extruded with the addition of different percentages of apple pomace (AP) by-product were evaluated. Characteristic volatile compounds were identified in the samples, such as alpha-farnesene, sulcatone and ethylphenyl propanoate. The film containing 8% AP had higher total phenolic content (3.32 mg GAE/g, Gallic acid equivalent) and antioxidant activity (2.78 mmol Trolox/g) than the control film (0.71 mg GAE/g and 1.03 mmol Trolox/g). The minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella thyphimurium, and Escherichia coli for the films containing AP was higher than 12.5 mg/mL for all species. The results suggest that the antioxidant and antibacterial activities and mechanical properties, are dependent on the quantity of the AP added to films. Due to its antioxidant activity and mechanical properties, the AP could have real potential use as a functional ingredient in biodegradable packaging with the advantage of having good antibacterial properties.

Ultrafiltration of Opuntia ficus-indica mucilage obtained by solvent-free mechanical extraction.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The ultrafiltration (UF) of cactus juices has been carried out for the purpose of clarification from an enzymatically pre-treated fruit. Concentration of mucilage (Opuntia ficus-indica) by cross-flow ultrafiltration, obtained by solvent-free mechanical extraction, using 1, 10, and 30 kDa membranes has been carried out. The etaE was 39.49% and the energy consumption was 247 times less than the evaporation one. The 1 kDa concentrated mucilage had the highest etaUF and total soluble solids although the fastest process was with the 30 kDa membrane which also extends its shelf life up to 60 days at 4 °C, preserving its viscous and viscoelastic properties and high contents of galacturonic acid, features desired to be applied as a dispersing agent. Chromatographic analysis shown that the passage of the monosaccharides during the ultrafiltration was in function of their position in the structure of mucilage molecule. Sugars such as galacturonic acid and galactose were conserved after filtration; however, decreased the concentration of sugars that make up the side chains (rhamnose, glucose, arabinose, and xylose) of the mucilage molecule. Practical applications. Mucilage (Opuntia ficus-indica) is a complex carbohydrate that is attractive to the food industry due to its excellent functional properties. Various authors have used vacuum evaporation or and membranes to clarify and concentrate mucilage but an enzymatic pre-treatment is carried out due to the gelling properties of the polysaccharide. In this work cactus extract obtained by the solvent-free mechanical process was concentrated with UF membranes without enzymatic treatment. UF process allowed to concentrate mucilage with good yield efficiency, low energy consumption and increases the shelf life of liquid form up to 60 days, preserving almost free of microorganisms as well as its viscous and viscoelastic properties and high contents of galacturonic acid, features which allows its application as stabilizer and thickener of nutritional supplements and preparation of functional drinks of nutritional value. The results obtained in this work might be extended to other cactus extracts that had wider industrial applicability. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Bioaccessibility of different types of phenolic compounds co-encapsulated in alginate/chitosan-coated zein nanoparticles.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Simultaneous administration of different phenolic compounds might produce a synergistic effect offering a greater activity against chronic non-communicable diseases. This has prompted significant interest in developing nanodelivery systems that simultaneously encapsulate different bioactives and protect them from gastrointestinal digestion. This work aimed at evaluating the suitability of zein (ZN) and zein/polysaccharide-based nanoparticles to co-encapsulate different types of phenolic compounds and understand how increasing the complexity of the nanoparticulate systems affected the bioaccessibility of the polyphenols. Two phenolic acids, two glycosylated flavonoids, and three flavonoid aglycones were successfully co-encapsulated in the three nanoparticulate systems. The encapsulation efficiency of phenolic compounds loaded on ZN ranged between 95.3 and 98.5%. The incorporation of the coating-layers (alginate-algZN- and chitosan-alg/chiZN-) significantly increased the encapsulation efficiency of phenolic acids and glycosylated flavonoids. The bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds loaded on ZN increased by at least 50.2%. Enhanced bioaccessibility of phenolic acids and glycosylated flavonoids was observed upon coating with alginate, while the greatest polyphenol bioaccessibility was seen for the alg/chiZN (over 65.8%). The greatest bioaccessibility was observed for polar phenolic acids, followed by glycosylated flavonoids. Therefore, the developed systems could be potentially useful to co-encapsulate different types of phenolic compounds and to improve their bioaccessibility. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Identification of the Pseudomonas fluorescens group as being responsible for blue pigment on fresh cheese.		Journal of Dairy Science					New cases of blue cheese discoloration has led to recent research to identify the causal agent and factors that favor blue pigment appearing. Nonetheless, very few reports have described the source of contamination and the measurements to eradicate the microbiological source on cheese farms by determining the relation between blue discoloration on fresh cheese and the Pseudomonas fluorescens group. Thus, 60 samples from a cheese farm (cheese, equipment surfaces, tap water, and raw and pasteurized milk) were analyzed by phenotypical, MALDI-TOF, 16S rRNA sequencing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis tests to determine the causal agent. The results obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with restriction enzymes XbaI and SpeI confirmed tap water as the initial contaminated source. The above-mentioned result was essential to avoid Pseudomonas contamination due to the most residual microorganisms being inactivated through a new disinfection program.

J		Carrillo, E.; Laguna, L.; Arancibia, C.; Tarrega, A.							Rescuing flavor identity and dynamic perception in pureed dishes; a restructuring solution for the puree diet.		Foods					With age, difficulties with masticating and swallowing means food consistency and structure must be modified, such as pureeing food. However, elderly consumers have reported that pureed food's taste lacks appeal. This study shows how pureeing food changes the recognition and dynamics of flavors and new strategies to improve them. Further, to measure the identification and dynamics of flavor, a new sensory method was investigated that combined Free Choice and Temporal Order of Sensation (Free-TOS). Three dishes (macaroni, pizza, and potato salad), their purees, and three pasta purees with added flavors (cheese and dry-cured ham) added directly or as an oil in water emulsion or using two types of emulsions (oil in water and water in oil) were assessed by three groups of 60 consumers using Free-TOS. Results showed that in the puree the frequency of mentioned sensations decreased compared with the dish, as it was more difficult to identify flavors. Adding flavors in powder form only allowed a cheese/ham flavor identification, but in the purees with emulsions, it was possible to identify the dry-cured ham flavor. Therefore, this study showed that the Free-TOS method does not need a predetermined attribute list and registers the actual identified flavors and their order of appearance. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Cartagena, L.; Puertolas, E.; Maranon, I. M. de							High-pressure pretreatment in albacore (Thunnus alalunga) for reducing freeze-driven weight losses with minimal quality changes.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This research evaluates the application of high-pressure processing (HPP) before freezing to reduce weight loss related to thawing and cooking of frozen albacore steaks (Thunnus alalunga) with a minimal impact on fish quality (color, texture, soluble protein, lipid oxidation). Albacore steaks were HPP pretreated (200, 250, and 300 MPa for 0, 2, 4 and 6 min), frozen (-20 °C, 5 ms-1), thawed (4 °C; 24 h), and then analyzed. Results. At lower pressures (200MPa) there was a clear effect of pressurization time on most of the fish quality parameters tested (thawing loss, L* value, b* value, DeltaE, adhesiveness, springiness, salt-soluble protein content), whereas at higher pressures (300MPa) similar changes took place independently of the pressurization time. High-pressure processing had no impact on lipid oxidation. A pressure of 200 MPa applied for 6 min decreased thawing, cooking, and total weight losses (53.7%, 55.4%, and 51.0% lower than the frozen control, respectively) although it led to noticeable changes in color. A pressure of 200MPa applied for 2 min decreased thawing, cooking, and total weight losses by 23.2%, 44.0% and 33.7% with respect to the frozen control, respectively, with only minor changes in color. Conclusion. High-pressure processing pretreatment could be a promising tool for reducing weight loss in frozen fish when HPP conditions are properly selected. A pressure of 200MPa applied for 2 min could be a good compromise treatment, cutting thawing and cooking losses in albacore, and reducing HPP-mediated color alterations and the related possible consumer rejection. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Cartagena, L.; Puertolas, E.; Maranon, I. M. de							Impact of different air blast freezing conditions on the physicochemical quality of albacore (Thunnus alalunga) pretreated by high pressure processing.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this work was to study the effect of different air blast freezing conditions (temperature: -20 °C, air velocity: 1 m/s; -20 °C, 5 m/s; -50 °C, 1 m/s; -50 °C, 5 m/s) on the quality of high pressure processing (HPP) pretreated (200 MPa, 6 min) albacore steaks. After 2 and 9 months of frozen storage, HPP and control samples were thawed and analyzed (thawing loss, cooking loss, total weight loss, color, texture profile, salt-soluble protein content and lipid oxidation). The HPP pretreatment had more impact on the albacore quality than lowering the freezing temperature or increasing the air velocity. For instance, after 9 months of frozen storage, the HPP pretreated samples before freezing under the slowest (-20 °C and 1 m/s) and the fastest (-50 °C and 5 m/s) freezing conditions presented similar thawing loss reductions (37 and 40%, respectively) with respect to their corresponding controls. Considering the conditions and parameters tested, HPP pretreatment (200 MPa, 6 min) followed by a freezing at -50 °C (at 1 or 5 m/s) would achieve the best results in albacore after up to 9 months of frozen storage.

J		Carter, B.; DiMarzo, L.; Pranata, J.; Barbano, D. M.; Drake, M.							Determination of the efficiency of removal of whey protein from sweet whey with ceramic microfiltration membranes.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our research objective was to measure percent removal of whey protein from separated sweet whey using 0.1-m uniform transmembrane pressure ceramic microfiltration (MF) membranes in a sequential batch 3-stage, 3* process at 50 °C. Cheddar cheese whey was centrifugally separated to remove fat at 72 °C and pasteurized (72 °C for 15 s), cooled to 4 °C, and held overnight. Separated whey (375 kg) was heated to 50 °C with a plate heat exchanger and microfiltered using a pilot-scale ceramic 0.1-m uniform transmembrane pressure MF system in bleed-and-feed mode at 50 °C in a sequential batch 3-stage (2 diafiltration stages) process to produce a 3* MF retentate and MF permeate. Feed, retentate, and permeate samples were analyzed for total nitrogen, noncasein nitrogen, and nonprotein nitrogen using the Kjeldahl method. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE analysis was also performed on the whey feeds, retentates, and permeates from each stage. A flux of 54 kg/m2 per hour was achieved with 0.1-m ceramic uniform transmembrane pressure microfiltration membranes at 50 °C. About 85% of the total nitrogen in the whey feed passed though the membrane into the permeate. No passage of lactoferrin from the sweet whey feed of the MF into the MF permeate was detected. There was some passage of IgG, bovine serum albumen, glycomacropeptide, and casein proteolysis products into the permeate. beta-Lactoglobulin was in higher concentration in the retentate than the permeate, indicating that it was partially blocked from passage through the ceramic MF membrane.

J		Carter, B.; Dimarzo, L.; Pranata, J.; Barbano, D. M.; Drake, M.							Efficiency of removal of whey protein from sweet whey using polymeric microfiltration membranes.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our objective was to measure whey protein removal percentage from separated sweet whey using spiral-wound (SW) polymeric microfiltration (MF) membranes using a 3-stage, 3* process at 50°C and to compare the performance of polymeric membranes with ceramic membranes. Pasteurized, separated Cheddar cheese whey (1,080kg) was microfiltered using a polymeric 0.3-mum polyvinylidene (PVDF) fluoride SW membrane and a 3*, 3-stage MF process. Cheese making and whey processing were replicated 3 times. There was no detectable level of lactoferrin and no intact alpha-or beta-casein detected in the MF permeate from the 0.3-mum SW PVDF membranes used in this study. We found BSA and IgG in both the retentate and permeate. The beta-lactoglobulin (beta-LG) and alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-LA) partitioned between retentate and permeate, but beta-LG passage through the membrane was retarded more than alpha-LA because the ratio of beta-LG to alpha-LA was higher in the MF retentate than either in the sweet whey feed or the MF permeate. About 69% of the crude protein present in the pasteurized separated sweet whey was removed using a 3*, 3-stage, 0.3-mum SW PVDF MF process at 50°C compared with 0.1-mum ceramic graded permeability MF that removed about 85% of crude protein from sweet whey. The polymeric SW membranes used in this study achieve approximately 20% lower yield of whey protein isolate (WPI) and a 50% higher yield of whey protein phospholipid concentrate (WPPC) under the same MF processing conditions as ceramic MF membranes used in the comparison study. Total gross revenue from the sale of WPI plus WPPC produced with polymeric versus ceramic membranes is influenced by both the absolute market price for each product and the ratio of market price of these 2 products. The combination of the market price of WPPC versus WPI and the influence of difference in yield of WPPC and WPI produced with polymeric versus ceramic membranes yielded a price ratio of WPPC versus WPI of 0.556 as the cross over point that determined which membrane type achieves higher total gross revenue return from production of these 2 products from separated sweet whey. A complete economic engineering study comparison of the WPI and WPPC manufacturing costs for polymeric versus ceramic MF membranes is needed to determine the effect of membrane material selection on long-term processing costs, which will affect net revenue and profit when the same quantity of sweet whey is processed under various market price conditions.

DNA adenine methylase, not the PstI restriction-modification system, regulates virulence gene expression in Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli.		Food Microbiology					We previously reported a distinct methylome between the two Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O145:H28 strains linked to the 2010 U.S. Lettuce-associated outbreak (RM13514) and the 2007 Belgium ice cream-associated outbreak (RM13516), respectively. This difference was thought to be attributed to a prophage encoded type II restriction-modification system (PstI R-M) in RM13514. Here, we characterized this PstI R-M system in comparison to DNA adenine methylase (Dam), a highly conserved enzyme in gamma proteobacteria, by functional genomics. Deficiency in Dam led to a differential expression of over 1000 genes in RM13514, whereas deficiency in PstI R-M only impacted a few genes transcriptionally. Dam regulated genes involved in diverse functions, whereas PstI R-M regulated genes mostly encoding transporters and adhesins. Dam regulated a large number of genes located on prophages, pathogenicity islands, and plasmids, including Shiga toxin genes, type III secretion system (TTSS) genes, and enterohemolysin genes. Production of Stx2 in dam mutant was significantly higher than in RM13514, supporting a role of Dam in maintaining lysogeny of Stx2-prophage. However, following mitomycin C treatment, Stx2 in RM13514 was significantly higher than that of dam or PstI R-M deletion mutant, implying that both Dam and PstI R-M contributed to maximum Stx2 production.

J		Carter, M. Q.; Pham, A.; Wen-Xian Du; Xiaohua He							Differential induction of Shiga toxin in environmental Escherichia coli O145:H28 strains carrying the same genotype as the outbreak strains.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O145 Is a major serotype associated with severe human disease. Production of Shiga toxins (Stxs), especially Stx2a, is thought to be correlated with STEC virulence. Since stx genes are located in prophages genomes, induction of prophages is required for effective Stxs production. Here, we investigated the production of Stxs in 12 environmental STEC O145:H28 strains under stresses STEC encounter in natural habitats and performed comparative analysis with two O145:H28 clinical strains, one linked to a 2010 U.S. Lettuce-associated outbreak (RM13514) and the other linked to a 2007 Belgium ice cream-associated outbreak (RM13516). Similar to the outbreak strains, all environmental strains belong to Sequence Type (ST)-78 using the EcMLST typing scheme. Although all Stx1a-prophages were grouped together, variations in Stx1a production were observed prior to or following the inductions. Among all stx2a positive environmental strains, only the Stx2a-prophage in cattle isolate RM9154-C1 was clustered with the Stx2a-prophages in RM13514, the Stx2a-phage induced from a STEC O104:H4 strain linked to the 2011 outbreak of enterohemorrhagic infection in Germany, and the Stx2a-prophage in STEC O157:H7 strain EDL933, a prototype of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. Furthermore, the Stx2a-prophage in RM9154-C1 shared the same chromosomal insertion site and carried the same antiterminator Q gene and the late promoter PR' as the Stx2a-prophage in RM13514. Following mitomycin C or enrofloxacin treatment, the production of Stx2a in RM9154-C1 was the highest among all environmental strains tested. In contrast, following acid challenge and recovery, the production of Stx2a in RM9154-C1 was the lowest among all the environmental strains tested, at a level comparable to the clinical strains. A significant increase in Stx2a production was detected in all strains when exposed to H2O2, although the induction fold was much lower than those by other inducers. This low-efficiency induction of Stx-prophages by H2O2, a natural inducer of Stx-prophages, supports the hypothesis of bacterial altruism in controlling Stxs production, a strategy that assures the survival of the STEC population as a whole by sacrificing a small fraction of cells for Stxs production and release. Differential induction of Stxs among strains carrying nearly identical Stx-prophages suggests a role of host bacteria in regulating Stxs production. Our study revealed diverse Stx-prophages in STEC O145:H28 strains that were genotypically indistinguishable. Identification of a cattle isolate harboring a Stx2a-prophage associated with high virulence supports the premise that cattle, a natural reservoir of STEC, serve as a source of hypervirulent STEC strains.

J		Carters-White, L.; Chambers, S.; Skivington, K.; Hilton, S.							Whose rights deserve protection? Framing analysis of responses to the 2016 Committee of Advertising Practice consultation on the non-broadcast advertising of foods and soft drinks to children.		Food Policy					Exposure to advertising of food and beverages high in fat sugar and salt (HFSS) is considered a factor in the development of childhood obesity. This paper uses framing analysis to examine the strategic discursive practices employed by non-industry and industry responders to the Committee of Advertising Practice's consultation responses (n=86) on UK regulation of non-broadcast advertising of foods and soft drinks to children. Our analysis demonstrates non-industry and industry responders engaged in a moral framing battle centred on whose rights were deemed as being of greatest importance to protect: children or industry. Both industry and non-industry responders acknowledged that childhood obesity and non-broadcast advertising were complex issues but diverged on how they morally framed their arguments. Non-industry responders employed a moral framework that aligned with the values represented in social justice approaches to public health policy, where children were identified as vulnerable, in need of protection from harmful HFSS product advertising and childhood obesity was a societal problem to solve. In contrast, industry responders emphasised industry rights, portraying themselves as a responsible industry that is victim to perceived disproportionate policymaking, and values more closely aligned with a market justice approach to public health policy. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the framing strategies used in the policy debate surrounding the non-broadcast advertising of HFSS foods to children. This has relevance as to how advocacy organisations can develop counter-framing to industry frames which seek to limit effective regulation.

J		Carullo, D.; Barbosa-Canovas, G. V.; Ferrari, G.							Changes of structural and techno-functional properties of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treated whey protein isolate over refrigerated storage.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This work assessed the effect of storage time on the structure and functionality of HHP-treated whey protein isolate (WPI). Different pressures (100-600 MPa) and treatment times (15-30 min) were applied to aqueous WPI dispersions (5% w/v). The induced degree of unfolding was evaluated to select optimal HHP treatment conditions of WPI before storage at 4 °C. Conformational and techno-functional properties of untreated and optimally HHP-treated WPI samples were determined by UV-Vis and IR spectroscopy, foaming capacity, and interfacial tension measurements, respectively. Further tests of HHP-assisted hydrolysis of WPI were performed by alpha-chymotrypsin, bromelain, or their mixture (1:1 w/w), with the degree of hydrolysis (DH%) and electrophoretic patterns analyzed. The maximum unfolding degree was detected after a treatment of 400 MPa and 15 min and, at these processing conditions, no aggregation occurred. However, the structural changes achieved upon HHP were gradually lost during storage through a first-order refolding process (kREF. =0.031 h-1), with restoring of native functionality. Hydrolysis performances of selected enzymes towards WPI were significantly promoted by high-pressure. Interestingly, a clear synergistic effect of alpha-chymotrypsin and bromelain combination on the WPI hydrolysis yield was detected, which resulted in the highest protein rupture (DH=17%).

J		Carvajal, C.; Rodriguez, M. C.; Tobon, J. C. A.							Physicochemical quality and antioxidant activity of blackberry suspensions: compositional and process effects.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The blackberry is characterized by its components presenting physiological activity. The objective of the research was to evaluate the influence of the composition and the homogenization time on the stability of suspensions based on blackberry concentrate (BC) and gum arabic (AG). The response surface methodology was used, considering the following independent variables: total solids provided by the BC TSBC (10%-11%), AG (0.4%-0.6%), and time (6-10 min), and the dependent variables: total suspension solids (TSS), pH, viscosity (mu), spectral absorption index (R), zeta potential (zeta), D10, D50, and D90, total phenols (TPs), antioxidant activity, and anthocyanins. The suspension was optimized under criteria of better physicochemical stability and higher antioxidant activity: TSS: 10.20.2%, pH: 3.070.01, mu: 1,123.738.1 cP, R: 0.380.04, | zeta|: 14.80.9 mV, D10, D50, and D90 (6.60.8; 86.74.1, and 245.912.9 mum, respectively), TP 473.561.0 mg GAE/100g, DPPH and ABTS: 843.466.7 and 699.949.7 mg trolox/100g, respectively, and anthocyanins: 21.91.6 mg cyd-3-glu/100g. The stability of the suspensions was favored by the synergistic effect of the mu-zeta, the low values of particle size, and R. Practical applications. Processing conditions and composition in the formulation of the suspensions based on blackberry, cause a series of changes in the quality parameters. The present work determines the stability of the colloidal system and composition in bioactive components, for effective use of the suspension in a spray drying process, thus strengthening the blackberry supply chain and generate value through alternatives that improve the shelf life of this fruit, characterized by having a short shelf life when they are in a fresh stage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			de los Rios Carvajal, Catalina/0000-0001-5551-1754							2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15498					FSTA:2021-10-Jf13823

Food Control					In this work, beta-carotene was selected to develop a novel study, namely a food colorant system based on beeswax solid lipid particles obtained by hot melt dispersion. The obtained microparticles were characterized by optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, particle size analysis and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy. It was observed that the obtained size can be modulated by using different amounts of emulsifier, as well as the dispersing capability. In a final stage, the obtained particles were tested concerning their colorant power by selecting a food matrix widely appreciated and consumed (mayonnaise). Moreover, the formulation providing the best hue and dispersibility (formulation containing 3% of Tween 80, and beta-carotene at 5 mg/25 g of commercial mayonnaise) was analysed along a storage period of 15 days concerning colour, nutritional value and chemical composition. The results pointed out for colour stability and nutritional value maintenance, after 15 days under storage at 6 °C.

Combination of a multiplatform metabolite profiling approach and chemometrics as a powerful strategy to identify bioactive metabolites in Lepidium meyenii (Peruvian maca).		Food Chemistry					Lepidium meyenii is an edible plant that has been used as a nutritional supplement worldwide due to its medicinal properties. However, most of the studies have focused on the pharmacological activities of the extracts rather than their chemical composition. Herein, we used a combination of a multiplatform metabolite profiling approach and chemometrics to identify bioactive metabolites in L. meyenii. Extracts obtained with ethyl acetate and ethanol showed the promising antioxidant, anti-glioma and antibacterial activities. Sixty metabolites were identified by HPLC-MS, whereas fifteen were identified by GC-MS. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) successfully discriminated extracts obtained in different organic solvents from in natura dry roots and commercial product samples of L. meyenii. Additionally, correlation analysis allowed us to pinpoint potential candidates responsible for each biological activity tested for the extracts, which could be extrapolate for other food-related species.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Barley malt is widely used in food and beverage industries. Although microwave drying can be an interesting alternative for stabilization, it has been traditionally processed by convective drying. This work studied the microwave and microwave-vacuum drying of barley malt, evaluating hydration, germination and drying. Both hydration and germination reduced the grain compression force, but without demonstrating a defined endpoint. The traditional convective drying (50-70 °C) took 540-840 min, while microwave reduced processing time in ~95%. Vacuum increased the drying rate and reduced the product temperature. Moisture profiles over processing were calculated based on the obtained effective diffusivity. The drying rate showed an intermediate moisture value when microwave radiation is optimum, which was associated with the best combination between absorption and conversion across the water molecules within the sample. The behavior parameter of Page Model suggested super-diffusion. In conclusion, microwave and microwave-vacuum technologies showed to be attractive alternatives for barley malt drying.

J		Carvalho, G. R.; Polachini, T. C.; Augusto, P. E. D.; Telis-Romero, J.; Bon, J.							Physical properties of barley grains at hydration and drying conditions of malt production.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Barley has shown several applications in food formulation, mainly after the malting process (hydration, germination, and drying). Because barley is steeped prior the malting, the aim of this work was to determine the physical properties of the grains and their bed as functions of a wide range of moisture content (12.68-80.28% d.b.). Such influences were evaluated and described through mathematical expressions. Length, width, thickness, different diameters, sphericity, and surface area of the barley grains increased with increasing moisture content, up to ~60%. Volume of thousand grains behaved similarly to these properties while their mass was increased continuously with increasing the moisture content. Bulk and true density tended to decrease during hydration while the bed porosity accompanied the density and volume variations. Specific surface area of the grains and bed decreased at higher moisture content due to the grain tri-dimensional expansion during hydration. Polynomial equations could be obtained to predict the studied properties as a function of the moisture content. Both experimental data and resulting models can be used to accurately design equipment and processes involving heat and mass transfer during malting as well as for determining parameters as water diffusion coefficients. Practical applications. Barley is an important cereal food and beverages applications, mainly to malt production. This study evaluated barley properties in a wide range of moisture contents, in order to understand its behavior under hydration and drying conditions. This data will provide important information needed to design different aspects of barley processing and storage. Moisture dependence of physical properties were determined for barley, considering a wide moisture range (12-80%d.b.). Barley achieved an expansion limit in moistures about 60-70% (d.b.). Simple polynomial equations were proposed to represent the physical properties. All physical properties were satisfactorily modeled. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The use of lemon juice and its role on polyunsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol oxides formation in thermally prepared sardines.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Lemon juice is used to enhance the flavor of dishes prepared with fish, which is more prone to oxidation than other flesh food. This study evaluated the impact of treating sardine fillets (Sardina pilchardus) with Tahiti lemon juice and submit them to different domestic cooking methods (air fryer, grill, and deep-fat fryer), regarding the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids and cholesterol. The juice extract was characterized by its antioxidant capacity and bioactive constituents by UHPLC-MS. Cooking caused the degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA, C20:5) and docosahexaenoic acids (DHA, C22:6), and increased the cholesterol oxides level. However, for most treatments, degradation of PUFAs and formation of cholesterol oxides were more pronounced in samples treated with juice. Lemon juice induced cholesterol oxidation, mainly in air-fried sardines where the total content of cholesterol oxides increased from 700 4 (control) to 1333 5 mug/g (10 % lemon juice, in dry basis). Thus, the overall data suggest that potential antioxidant compounds may have degraded during heating and the acid environment may have induced oxidative reactions.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This work aimed to study the stability by thermal cyclization of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs) loaded with ascorbic acid (AA). It studies thermal cyclization stability, SLMs were submitted to storage in stress conditions at two alternating temperatures (30 and 45 °C) for 48 hr each cycle. The particles were characterized by thermal behavior using DSC, polymorphism, AA retention levels, and AA retention kinetic modeling. The analyses were performed on days 0,7, 15,30, and 45 of storage. At the end of the 45th day, the SLMs presented good AA retention values, equivalent to 76.39%, 74.25%-83.07%, respectively, for F1, F2, and F3. The results indicate that all the SLMs had controlled release and followed the Higuchi kinetic model, and the melting peaks remained stable throughout the storage period. The polymorphic analysis revealed that the beta' crystals type was predominant in all the formulations studied. Novelty impact statement. For the application of solid lipid microparticles (SLMs), it is necessary to study their physical stability during storage. The use of temperature fluctuations (thermal cyclization) allows the study of the polymorphic, thermal, and retention behavior of the asset in the SLMs. The particles obtained in this work proved to be stable (controlled release by Higuchi model) when subjected to thermal stress during the 45 days of storage, with AA retention ranging from 74.25% to 83.07%, beta' crystals, and invariable melting properties. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15557					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14634

Impact of citrus flavonoid supplementation on inflammation in lipopolysaccharide-induced periodontal disease in mice.		Food & Function					In general, the consumption of flavonoid-rich foods may influence the control/dysregulation of the magnitude and duration of inflammation and oxidative stress, which are known to contribute to multiple pathologies. Information regarding the impact of citrus flavonoid dietary supplementation on periodontal disease is still scarce. Herein, we investigated whether a diet supplemented with eriocitrin and eriodictyol could alter the course of the inflammatory response associated with LPS-induced periodontal disease in mice. Sixty BALB/c mice received a standard diet or a diet supplemented with different concentrations of eriocitrin or eriodictyol. After 30 days of food supplementation, a solution containing LPS from Escherichia coli was injected into the gingival tissues three times per week for four weeks. Neutrophils, mononuclear cells and eosinophils were assessed using a severity analysis system in H & E-stained sections and modified picrosirius red. The activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO), a marker of granulocyte infiltration, and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) were determined spectrophotometrically. The oxidative damage was determined by measuring the malondialdehyde (MDA) content and anti-oxidative activity through the assessment of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx). Interleukin (IL)-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IL-10 were quantified by multiplex immunoassay. Periodontal inflammation was significantly inhibited by citrus flavonoid supplementation, including reduced flatness of the gingival epithelium and chronic and acute inflammatory cell infiltration, as well as loss of connective tissue in the gingival papillae. Both eriocitrin and eriodictyol inhibited gingival IL-1beta and TNF-alpha and increased IL-10 secondary to periodontitis. Significant protection and decreased MPO and EPO activity were detected in the periodontal tissue of citrus flavonoid-treated animals. In comparison with the LPS group, SOD, CAT and GPx activities were increased, while the MDA content was reduced, indicating decreased oxidative damage. These results suggest that a diet supplemented with the citrus flavonoids eriocitrin or eriodictyol may aid in the prevention of periodontitis, representing a potential method to enhance local immunity and host defense. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	11	5007	5017	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo03338c					FSTA:2021-10-Jc13176
J		Carvalho, L. M.; Delgado, J.; Madruga, M. S.; Estevez, M.							Pinpointing oxidative stress behind the white striping myopathy: depletion of antioxidant defenses, accretion of oxidized proteins and impaired proteostasis.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of the white striping (WS) myopathy with particular attention to the role of oxidative stress and protein oxidation in the loss of meat quality. Results. It was found that WS-M (moderate degree; white stripes <1mm thickness) and WS-S (severe degree; white stripes >1mm thickness) breast presented higher pH, hardness, redness, lipid, and collagen content, and lower lightness than normal breast. Compared with the latter, WS-S had a more severe loss of protein thiols (70.7% less thiols than in N), reduced activity of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (23 versus 40Ug-1), glutathione peroxidase (0.21 versus 0.54Ug-1), and superoxide dismutase (56 versus 73Ug-1), and consequently, had greater accretion of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (0.64 versus 0.22mg MDAkg-1 muscle), allysine (3.1 versus 1.9 nmolmg-1 protein) and Schiff base structures (645 versus 258 fluorescent units). The analysis of sarcoplasmic proteins revealed that muscles severely affected by the myopathy suffered a chronic impairment of physiological (upregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, sarcalumenin and calsequestrin-2) and metabolic processes (downregulation of pyruvate kinase, creatine kinase, and l-lactate dehydrogenase). Conclusion. The overexpression of ribonuclease / angiogenin inhibitor 1 and Kelch-like proteins in WS chicken breasts indicates altered protein turnover plausibly mediated by oxidative stress and accumulation of oxidized proteins. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Quality and stability of cooked sausages made from turkey meat affected by the white striping myopathy.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					White striping (WS) defect is described by the appearance of white striation in pectoralis major muscles. This study was aimed to develop a cooked sausage made from turkey breast meat with different degrees of WS myopathy (breasts with no striations "NOR, " fillets with striations < 1 mm "MOD" and > 1 mm "SEV"). Physico-chemical properties, microbiological, and sensory characteristics were assessed. As the myopathy increased, there was an increase in the lipid content (from 1.67 to 2.73 g/100 g) and TBARs (from 0.147 to 0.229 at Day 0 and from 0.387 to 0.472 mg MDA/kg at 56 days of storage), and a decrease in the hardness of cooked sausages (686,705 and 542 N for NOR, MOD, and SEV, respectively). During the storage (56 days at 4 °C), an increase in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARs) values was observed in all samples studied, presenting NOR the lowest TBARs values. Regarding color parameters, the highest a* values were observed in MOD sausages (p>.05; between 6.6 and 6.88 in MOD versus 6.03 and 6.40 in the other two batches), whereas the highest b* values were found in SEV sausages (p<.05; between 6.15 and 6.67 in SEV versus <6.0 in the other two batches). Concerning sensorial analysis, all samples were well accepted (scores >7). The NOR and MOD samples had the same scores for overall acceptability (7.48-7.62), while the use of SEV meat produced a slight decrease (7.25; p<.05). Therefore, turkey breast fillets with WS can be used in the manufacture of cooked sausages without impairing the quality of the products obtained. Practical applications. Consumers demand high-quality products. White striping myopathy (WS) is a defect that affects both the composition and appearance of turkey meat. Therefore, the use of meat that has this defect for the preparation of cooked sausages is an alternative for the meat industry. This allows the meat industry to be more competitive, since it allows the use of meat of low commercial value, but with excellent nutritional characteristics for the preparation of a meat product, and therefore allows to commercialize this meat with added value. With this in mind, the present study is proposed to observe the influence of the use of meat with WS in comparison with the use of normal meat on the quality of the processed sausages. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) considered an unconventional species, is a cactus popularly consumed by local populations of Semiarid Brazilian and the cladodes are used in food preparations. The objective of this study was to elaborate juice with cladodes xique-xique and to characterize its nutritional composition, determine the bioaccessibility of phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity. The juice presented relevant soluble fibers (0.55 g/100 ml) and minerals contents. Nineteen phenolics compounds were identified in xique-xique juice. Flavanols were the major class of phenolic compounds with epigallocatechin gallate (14.52 mg/ml) and catechin (4.71 mg/ml). After the gastrointestinal digestion catechin (16.49%), epigallocatechin gallate (23%), procyanidin B1 (27.81%) and B2 (15.79%), gallic (50.74%), and caffeic (17%) acids were bioaccessible, demonstrating a strong correlation with high antioxidant activity by ORAC and FRAP assay. This research demonstrates xique-xique juice is a new source of intake of minerals, fibers and phenolic compounds, and that it also aggregates value to an underexploited specie. Practical applications. Xique-xique (Pilosocereus gounellei) considered an unconventional species is a cactus popularly consumed by local populations of Semiarid Brazilian, and the cladodes are used in food preparations. Despite the widespread use of xique-xique by the communities of the Brazilian semi-arid region, still, there is no scientific data on the nutritional composition of xique-xique cladode juice. The juice represents an alternative source for the consumption of fiber, minerals, and bioaccessible phenolic compounds, since it presents a variety of phenolic compounds that contribute to the antioxidant capacity. Furthermore, it can be used for application in the food industry in the manufacture of different drinks. The elaboration of products using unconventional food plants, rich in nutrients and bioactive compounds, could be a health benefit and add value to local resources. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15265					FSTA:2021-08-Hq7884
J		Carvalho, T. C. L. de; Nunes, C. A.							Smartphone-based method for the determination of chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in olive and avocado oils: an approach with calibration transfer.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Chlorophylls and carotenoids in vegetable oils are usually analyzed by spectrophotometric methods. On the other hand, a simple and economical analytic method is to apply a portable colorimetric method based on digital images. However, in some cases, the results can be influenced by external variables, such as the type of camera and lighting. Thus, the objective of this study was to use a method that could take data from digital images taken by smartphones, calibrate the data by multiple linear regression (MLR) or least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and thereby predict the levels of chlorophyll and carotenoids in olive and avocado oils. In addition, a type of calibration transfer was proposed based on images of FeCl3.6H2O solutions and was tested under different conditions (type of camera and lighting). The effect of the color space used to describe the images, including RGB, Y, HSV, CMYK, L*a*b, and XYZ, was also evaluated. The models performed well, but the LS-SVM models outperformed the MLR models on both chlorophylls and carotenoids. The predictions under secondary conditions were more strongly influenced by lighting than by smartphone type. Considerable improvements in the predictions under secondary conditions were observed when applying the calibration transfer, especially under different lighting conditions, as the RMSE decreased and the R increased for both pigments. The best performance after applying the calibration transfer was obtained using the XYZ/LS-SVM model for chlorophylls and Y/LS-SVM for carotenoids, which had mean RMSEs of 0.96 and 0.29 mg/kg with mean R of 0.96 and 0.83 for chlorophylls and carotenoids, respectively. Therefore, the method based on digital images taken by smartphones and the proposed calibration transfer shows great potential to determine pigments in vegetable oils, with good accuracy under different lighting conditions and with different smartphone models.

Consumer preferences for origin and organic attributes of extra virgin olive oil: a choice experiment in the Italian market.		Foods					The paper investigates Italian consumers' behavior towards characteristics of extra virgin olive oil, in particular organic production methods and geographical origin. On the basis of the existing literature, the concepts of sustainability of food systems, diets, and the olive oil supply chain are analyzed. A choice experiment (CE), using a face-to-face questionnaire with over 1000 participants, was conducted to quantify the willingness to pay (WTP) for these two attributes. Findings show positive preference for origin attributes, while the organic attribute is not highly valued. The article also offers some perspectives on future research to improve the competitiveness and sustainability of the Italian olive oil supply chain. © 2021 by the authors.

Peer inter-laboratory validation study of a harmonized SPME-GC-FID method for the analysis of selected volatile compounds in virgin olive oils.		Food Control					In the context of supporting the panel test in the classification of virgin olive oils, the qualitative and quantitative analysis of a number of volatile compounds responsible for their aroma is of great importance. Herein, the data obtained from three laboratories that analyzed the same samples are presented with the view to develop an inter-laboratory validation study of a harmonized solid-phase micro-extraction coupled with gas-chromatography with flame ionized detector (SPME-GC-FID) method for determination of selected volatile compounds. In particular, quantification of the minimum number of key markers responsible for positive attributes (e.g.fruity) and sensory defects was investigated. Three quantification strategies were considered since they can have a notable impact on the effectiveness of the use of markers as well as on the robustness and simplicity of the method that is designed for control laboratories. A peer-validation study indicated repeatability with a mean relative standard deviation (RSD%) lower than 14% except for ethyl propanoate, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and (E)-2-decenal. Linearity was satisfactory (R2> 0.90) for all compounds when the calibration curves were corrected by the internal standard. Several critical issues were identified, such as high RSD% (>50%) in terms of reproducibility for ethyl propanoate, (E)-2-decenal, and possible improvements of the limits of detection (LODs) and quantitation (LOQs) of (E)-2-heptenal, (E, E)-2,4-hexadienal, and (E)-2-decenal. In particular, some compounds (ethyl propanoate, (E)-2-heptenal, 1-octen-3-ol, (E, E)-2,4-hexadienal, (E)-2-decenal and pentanoic acid) showed LOQs that were higher than the concentrations found in some samples. The discussion permitted improvement of the protocol towards the final version for an upcoming full validation process. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Assays of synergistic antioxidant effect with commercial food additives.		Food Chemistry					The main causes of food spoilage come from the process of oxidation and the contamination by microorganisms. For the purpose of increasing food shelf-life the industries employ different techniques, being the addition of preservatives, one of the most used. The aim of this contribution was to investigate the potential antioxidant properties of tyrosol (4-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, 4-OH) and tyrosol derived isomers (2-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, 2-OH and 3-hydroxyphenethyl alcohol, 3-OH) against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antimicrobial effect on Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the type of antioxidant effect of substrates and commercial antioxidants mixtures was studied. Upon visible-light, the substrates interacted with the vitamin B2 and different ROS were generated. All the compounds deactivated O2 (1Deltag) and O2.-, whereas only 2-OH and 3-OH inhibited H2O2 and HO.. The substrates exhibited a synergistic antioxidant effect when combined with commercial antioxidants. 2-OH showed antimicrobial activity against strains tested. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Mesostructured silica-coated magnetic nanoparticles to extract six opium alkaloids in poppy seeds prior to ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.		Foods					In recent years, health authorities have become increasingly concerned about preventing consumer exposure to opium alkaloids present in Papaver somniferum L. Poppy seeds. In this study, a simple, rapid and efficient method has been optimised to determine all main opioids in poppy seeds (morphine, codeine, thebaine, papaverine, noscapine and oripavine) by UHPLC-QqQ-MS/MS. For this purpose, solid-liquid extraction (SLE) of samples was optimised and six magnetic adsorbent materials with a core of Fe3O4 coated with amorphous and mesostructured silica, both functionalised with octadecyl-silane or octyl-silane were characterised and evaluated for magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE). The material with the best results was non-functionalised mesostructured silica and, with it, the MSPE procedure was optimised. This method was validated and used to quantify six opioids in 14 edible seed samples (eleven poppy seeds and three seed mixes). Considerable amounts were found (1.5-249.0 mg/kg morphine, <0.2 g/kg-45.8 mg/kg codeine, <2.4 g/kg-136.2 mg/kg thebaine, <0.2 g/kg-27.1 mg/kg papaverine, <0.2 g/kg-108.7 mg/kg noscapine and <240 g/kg-33.4 mg/kg oripavine), exceeding maximum limits established in some EU countries and the reference level of morphine in the EU. Furthermore, in some commercial samples for human consumption, inadequate labelling was found because significant amounts of alkaloids were detected even though Papaver rhoeas L. Seeds were declared on the product label. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Casagrande, E.; Genard, M.; Lurol, S.; Charles, F.; Plenet, D.; Lescourret, F.							A process-based model of nectarine quality development during pre- and post-harvest.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					A new mathematical modeling framework able to simulate the combined effect of fruit growth and post-harvest storage conditions (temperature and relative humidity) on nectarine quality is here proposed. The seasonal course of fruit surface conductance to water vapor, fruit mass loss during storage, and sugar concentration dynamics in fruit pulp were modeled. The three sub-models were integrated into a model capable of calculating a fruit sweetness index and relative water loss during storage, which were selected as nectarine quality criteria. Sub-models parameters were calibrated through results from experiments carried on during 2018 and 2019, where horticultural practices (irrigation and fruit load) and storage conditions were jointly varied. Irrigation level influenced fruit surface conductance to water vapor at harvest, but experimental results point out that this variable may have little influence on fruit mass loss during storage, which was mainly driven by relative humidity in the storage chamber. Irrigation intensity was also influential on sugar dynamics, along with storage temperature, with fruit stored at the higher temperature (25°C) being sweeter than those stored at lower ones (2 and 15°C). These experimental results were well replicated by the sub-model outputs. Model simulations during storage revealed a trade-off between the two selected quality criteria, which increased with increasing storage temperature and decreasing relative humidity. The best scenario in terms of acceptable fruit mass loss and sweetness index was for fruit from water-stressed and low crop-loaded trees, 15°C and 70% relative humidity. Moreover, storage duration was shown to increase fruit mass loss and, to a lesser extent, the sweetness index, while fruit from late harvest dates had higher sweetness at the end of storage. The model can potentially be used to manage and optimize pre-harvest and storage practices that will maximize sweetness and minimize mass loss to meet fruit quality standards along supply chains.

Effect of continuous white light illumination on glucosinolate metabolism during postharvest storage of broccoli.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Broccoli is a vegetable consumed globally due to its important nutritional properties, including high concentrations of glucosinolates. Light treatment can be an important tool to delay postharvest senescence. In this work it was evaluated the effect of postharvest continuous white light illumination on glucosinolate metabolism of broccoli heads. Five glucosinolates were identified, one aliphatic (glucoraphanin) and four indolics (glucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin). Level of total glucosinolates decreased from 10.1 mumol/g dry tissue to 1.4 mumol/g dry tissue in control samples after five days of storage, while the decrement was only until 3.0 mumol/g dry tissue in treated samples. The expression of genes associated with glucosinolate metabolism decreased during the first three days but this decrease was greater in illuminated samples. After five days, treated samples showed a higher expression (more than twice) in most of these genes with respect to the controls, coinciding with the higher glucosinolate content. Storage of broccoli heads under continuous white light allows to keep higher values of glucosinolate contents while maintaining at the same time the visual quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Control					Stainless steel has always been considered suitable for food contact, even though it has been demonstrated that this material has the tendency to release metal ions when used in food contact applications. In this study, the testing procedure for metal release in simulated food contact proposed by the Italian Ministerial Decree 21.03.1973 highlighted some critical aspects that needed to be improved such as the surface finishing, solution composition and volume, and reproducibility. AISI 304 austenitic and AISI 420 type B martensitic stainless steels were chosen to optimize the parameters of test procedure for release of Chromium, Nickel and Manganese. The effects of the steel chemical composition, the material fabrication cycle and the testing method on metal release were evaluated. Considering the achieved results, a list of suggestions is proposed for the improvement of the Italian law.

In-plant validation of novel on-site ozone generation technology (Bio-Safe) compared to lactic acid beef carcasses and trim using natural microbiota and Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 surrogate enumeration.		Foods					The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of an aqueous ozone (Bio-Safe) treatment and lactic acid solutions on natural microbiota and E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella surrogates on beef carcasses and trim in a commercial beef processing plant. For every repetition, 40 carcass and 40 trim swabs (500 cm2) were collected. Samples were taken using EZ-ReachTM swabs, and plated into aerobic plate count (APC), coliform, and E. coli PetrifilmTM for enumeration. In addition, a five-strain cocktail (MP-26) of E. coli surrogates was inoculated onto trim. For every trim surrogate repetition, 30 trim pieces were sampled after attachment and after ozone intervention. Samples were diluted and counts were determined using the TEMPO system for E. coli enumeration. Ozone and lactic acid interventions significantly reduced (p< 0.003) bacterial counts in carcasses and trim samples. Moreover, lactic acid further reduced APC and coliforms in trim samples compared to ozone intervention (p< 0.009). In the surrogate trials, ozone significantly reduced (p< 0.001) surrogate concentration. Historical data from the plant revealed a reduction (p< 0.001) of presumptive E. coli O157:H7 in trim after a full year of ozone intervention implementation. The novel technology for ozone generation and application as an antimicrobial can become an alternative option that may also act synergistically with existing interventions, minimizing the risk of pathogens such as Salmonella and E. coli O157:H7. © 2021 by the authors.

Biomapping of microbial indicators on beef subprimals subjected to spray or dry chilling over prolonged refrigerated storage.		Foods					As the global meat market moves to never frozen alternatives, meat processors seek opportunities for increasing the shelf life of fresh meats by combinations of proper cold chain management, barrier technologies, and antimicrobial interventions. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of spray and dry chilling combined with hot water carcass treatments on the levels of microbial indicator organisms during the long-term refrigerated storage of beef cuts. Samples were taken using EZ-Reach sponge samplers with 25 mL buffered peptone water over a 100 cm2 area of the striploin. Sample collection was conducted before the hot carcass wash, after wash, and after the 24 h carcass chilling. Chilled striploins were cut into four sections, individually vacuum packaged, and stored to be sampled at 0, 45, 70, and 135 days (n=200) of refrigerated storage and distribution. Aerobic plate counts, enterobacteria, Escherichia coli, coliforms, and psychrotroph counts were evaluated for each sample. Not enough evidence (p> 0.05) was found indicating the hot water wash intervention reduced bacterial concentration on the carcass surface. E. coli was below detection limits (<0.25 CFU/cm2) in most of the samples taken. No significant difference (p> 0.05) was found between coliform counts throughout the sampling dates. Feed type did not seem to influence the (p> 0.25) microbial load of the treatments. Even though no immediate effect was seen when comparing spray or dry chilling of the samples at day 0, as the product aged, a significantly lower (p< 0.05) concentration of aerobic and psychrotrophic organisms in dry-chilled samples could be observed when compared to their spray-chilled counterparts. Data collected can be used to select alternative chilling systems to maximize shelf life in vacuum packaged beef kept over prolonged storage periods. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Borage (Borago officinalis L.) seed oil is an important source of gamma-linolenic acid, which is normally used as a treatment against different pathologies. Since the fractionation of this interesting seed oil has many environmental, economic and biological benefits, two borage fractionation techniques after extraction with CO2 under supercritical conditions have been studied: precipitation in two cyclone separators and countercurrent extraction column. Both techniques have successfully collected free fatty acids in one fraction: (i) two separators set up in series obtained the highest concentration of free fatty acids in separator 2 at 90 bar/40°C; (ii) when countercurrent extraction column was used, the acidity index of the raffinate stream was independent from the operating conditions (2.6 0.5%). Furthermore, the composition of the fatty acids, as well as their antioxidant and cytotoxic activities, were determined. The profile of the fatty acids obtained by either of these two methods remained unaltered, so that the crude oil exhibited improved antioxidant and cytotoxic properties. All the extracts obtained in the two cyclone separators at the same pressure/temperature conditions displayed high tumouricidal activity against HL 60 promyelocytic leukaemia cells, even if the extracts at 50% concentration from separator 2 presented a lower inhibitory activity (IC50). The extracts from separator 2 at 90 bar/40°C exhibited the highest anti-proliferative activity at low doses (IC50 of 0.3 muL/mL for the trypan blue exclusion test). To reach the lethal dose-IC50-with the product obtained through countercurrent column fractionation, a concentration of 2 muL/mL of crude borage oil raffinate was required. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Casas-Forero, N.; Orellana-Palma, P.; Petzold, G.							Recovery of solutes from ice and concentrated fractions in centrifugal block cryoconcentration applied to blueberry juice.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The aim of this study was to describe the impact of centrifugal block cryoconcentration (CBCC) at three cycles on physicochemical parameters, total bioactive compounds (TBC), individual phenolic content (IPC), and antioxidant activity (AA) applied to fresh blueberry juice. Additionally, the recovery of cryoconcentrate solution from the ice fractions was evaluated. The total soluble solids (TSS), TBC, IPC, and AA of the cryoconcentrate and ice fractions showed a significant increase in the last cycle, and these results were over 3.3, 2.7, 3.2, and 1.8 times higher than the fresh juice, respectively. However, a high cryoconcentrate occlusion within the ice crystals was observed in the second and third cycles, in which the average partition coefficient was between 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. Thus, the recovered cryoconcentrates from the ice fractions exhibited values of approximately 34 °Brix, 1700 mg GAE/100 g d.m., 770 mg CEQ/100 g d.m., and 210 mg C3G/100 g d.m., 3200, and 4800 mumol TE/100 g d.m. For TSS, total polyphenol, flavonoid, and anthocyanin contents, 2, 2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), respectively. Therefore, the recycling of the ice fraction to recover cryoconcentrated solution is an interesting alternative to improve process parameters in CBCC, and in addition, this allows obtaining a cryoconcentrate rich in physicochemical properties, phenolic compounds, and antioxidant activity, and thus, it could be incorporated into the cryoconcentrated stock solution. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Effects of cryoconcentrate blueberry juice incorporation on gelatin gel: a rheological, textural and bioactive properties study.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cryoconcentrate blueberry juice (CBJ) at different concentrations was incorporated into gelatin gel and the effects on rheological and textural properties, total bioactive compounds (TBC) and antioxidant activity (AA) were evaluated. Specifically, CBJ at 20 g/100 g reinforced the gel structure, since the sample showed the highest gelling (15.0 °C) and melting temperatures (27.4 °C) in comparison to the other samples. Additionally, this CBJ concentration had an increase of 28%, 46%, 47% and 54% in relation to the initial gel strength, hardness, gumminess, and chewiness, respectively. In TBC and AA terms, the values were close to 55 mg GAE/100 g, 4.5 mg C3G/100 g, 18 mg CEQ/100 g, 42, 29 and 738 mumol TE/100 g, which are equivalent to 18%, 11%, 14%, 8%, 3% and 32%, for total polyphenol, anthocyanin and flavonoid contents, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assays, in relation to the initial CBJ value, respectively. Scanning electron microscope images revealed that the CBJ-gelatin gels formed a structural network with porous and thick walls. Therefore, CBJ has the potential to be an excellent ingredient to add during gelatin gel preparation since it delivers bioactive components without affecting the rheological and textural properties.

Detailed chemical composition of Cabernet Sauvignon wines aged in French oak barrels coopered with three different stave bending techniques.		Food Chemistry					Cabernet Sauvignon wines were aged for 15 months in used and new French 225 L oak barrels, followed by a period of 3 months in bottle. In addition to control barrels (3 years old), three bending/toasting protocols, including fire bent and fire toasted (fire-bent); water bent and fire toasted (water-bent); and a hybridized method based on fire bending and toasting followed by a 12 h fill with water at 80 °C (fire-bent+ hot water), were trialed in triplicate. Parameters such as acetic acid and alcohol content (higher in control wines), and anthocyanins, color and polymeric pigments (higher in wines aged in the new barrels), were more affected by barrel use (new versus neutral) than by bending/toasting protocols. At the end of the study (day 602), only 4-vinyl-guaiacol, eugenol and cis-lactone showed odor activity values (OAV's) above 1, with the latter being the most relevant odor active compound across treatments whereas eugenol was 10-fold higher in the water-bent wines. Principal component analysis (PCA) including phenolics and volatile compounds suggested differences between wines aged in control and new barrels, but less clear-cut differences within wines aged in barrels produced with the different bending/toasting protocols.

CS did not affect the basic chemistry of the wines, nor improved anthocyanins, polymeric pigments and total phenolics relative to Control wines (10 days maceration). Wine tannins were lowered in CS + 5d wines by 71 % (Cabernet Sauvignon) and by 29 % (Merlot). CIELab coordinates showed a negative impact on L*, C*, and copigmentation in CS wines indicating that these wines were lighter in color than their Control counterparts and these differences could be distinguished by the human eye.

Given the low protein content of standard GF flours, it is particularly important to fortify GF foods, and to study the effect that this process exerts on functional and sensorial characteristics. In this work, fortification of GF bakery goods was done with the addition of Arthrospira platensis (spirulina) flour. Two different dough formulations (with and without fortification) were fermented by four different processes, including spontaneous, single strains and sourdough starters. The baked products were then subjected to "consumer's tests". During the process, fermentation performances, prebiotic activity, and the VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) profiles were analyzed and compared through robust multivariate statistics. The results obtained evidenced that fortification led to a product with more abundant (medium organic acids) and exclusive bioactives (thymol, borneol, and nicotinic acid), which were correlated to the prebiotic activity of spirulina breads. This work, for the first time indicates that spirulina can be used to fortify GF bakery, improving also its functional potential. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.			nissen, lorenzo/0000-0002-7875-6321; Casciano, Flavia/0000-0003-1515-4101							2021	12	20	10226	10238	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01239h					FSTA:2022-02-Mq0731

Multiclass, multiresidue method for the quantification and confirmation of 112 veterinary drugs in game meat (bison, deer, elk, and rabbit) by rapid polarity switching liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					An analytical program for multiclass, multiresidue residue analysis to qualitatively and quantitatively determine veterinary drug compounds in game meats by LC-MS/MS has been developed and validated. The method was validated for the analysis of muscle from bison, deer, elk, and rabbit to test for 112 veterinary drug residues from the following drug classes: beta-agonists, anthelmintics, anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, fluoroquinolones, beta-lactams, macrolides, nitroimidazoles, phenicols, polypeptides, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, thyreostats, and tranquilizers. Muscle was extracted using a simple and quick procedure based on a solvent extraction with 80% ACN/water and sample cleanup with dispersive solid-phase extraction. The compounds of interest were separated using a Waters HSS T3 column and detected by tandem mass spectrometry with rapid polarity switching to detect both negatively and positively charged ions in a single run. Recoveries were calculated using extracted matrix-matched calibration curves for each type of matrix. The average accuracy of fortified compounds ranged from 95.6 to 101% at the target quantitative validation level in the four matrices. The method was also validated as a qualitative screening method where all sample responses were compared with a single extracted matrix-matched calibrant at the target testing level (5 or 25 ng/g). Samples demonstrating a presumptive positive above the threshold value were re-extracted and analyzed with a five-point matrix-matching extracted calibration curve. Since the beginning of this survey program, 360 samples have been analyzed for veterinary drug residues in game meats. Antibiotic or tranquilizer residues have been identified in deer (chlortetracycline, haloperidol, and tulathromycin) and rabbit (sulfadiazine).

J		Cason, C.; Veerachandra K. Yemmireddy; Moreira, J.; Achyut Adhikari							Antioxidant properties of pecan shell bioactive components of different cultivars and extraction methods.		Foods					Pecan shells are a rich source of various bioactive compounds with potential antioxidant and antimicrobial properties. This study investigated the effect of pecan variety and method extraction on the antioxidant property of shell extracts. Twenty different varieties of pecan shells were subjected to either aqueous or ethanolic extraction and were examined for total phenolics and antiradical activity. The phenolic content and antiradical activity of shell extracts were significantly (p< 0.05) varied with different pecan cultivars. The total phenolic content of ethanol extracts ranged from 304.2 (Caddo) to 153.54 (Cherokee) mg GAE g-1 of dry extract and was significantly greater (p < 0.05) than those obtained by aqueous extraction. The antiradical activity of ethanol extracts ranged from 840.6 (Maramec) to 526.74 (Caper Fear) mg TE g-1, while aqueous extracts ranged from 934.9 (Curtis) to 468.3 (Elliot) mg TE g-1. Chemical profiling of the crude and acid hydrolyzed extracts was performed by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography and flow injection electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. Lignin degradation products such as lignols, dilignols, trilignols, and oligolignols were found to be the major components of tested extracts. Phenolic content and antiradical activity of pecan shell extracts are significantly varied with cultivars and methods of extraction. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Casper, D. P.; Pretz, J. P.; Purvis, H. T.							Supplementing additional cobalt as cobalt lactate in a high-forage total mixed ration fed to late-lactation dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					Cobalt lactate is a highly soluble ruminal Co source. Prior research evaluating higher Co feeding rates demonstrated increased ruminal fiber digestion. Feeding high-forage (>70%) rations to late-lactation dairy cows to enhance income over feed cost could potentially benefit from higher ruminal-soluble Co inclusion rates to enhance ruminal fiber and nutrient digestibility. Twenty-four late-lactation [238 68.8 d in milk (DIM) and 36.4 5.4 kg/d milk] Holstein dairy cows (10 primiparous and 14 multiparous) were blocked by milk yield, DIM, and parity, and randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatments. Treatments were (1) control, CoCO3 total mixed ration (TMR) containing 12.5 mg/cow per day of cobalt (cobalt carbonate), and (2) cobalt lactate (Co-LAC), same CoCO3 TMR but containing an additional 50 mg/cow per day of Co, via a 1% cobalt lactate product (CoMax, Ralco Inc.). The basal TMR was 70% forage [60% alfalfa baleage and 40% corn silage on a dry matter (DM) basis] and 30% of the respective experimental grain mix on a DM basis. Cows were fed the CoCO3 TMR during the 7-d covariate period, followed by 4 wk of data collection when CoCO3 and Co-LAC TMR were fed. Milk production (26.2 and 25.8 kg/d for CoCO3 and Co-LAC, respectively) and dry matter intake (DMI; 22.9 and 23.1 kg/d) were similar for cows fed both Co treatments. Production of milk fat (1.02 and 1.09 kg/d), milk protein (0.87 and 0.91 kg/d), and lactose (1.17 and 1.26 kg/d) were similar for cows fed both treatments. Body weights (684 and 674 kg) were similar for cows fed both treatments. Rumen ammonia concentrations (15.8 and 12.3 mg/dL) were lower for cows fed Co-LAC compared with cows fed CoCO3 (15.8 mg/dL). Ruminal molar acetate concentrations (59.5 and 61.1%) were greater for cows fed Co-LAC compared with cows fed CoCO3. Feeding additional Co as cobalt lactate in the TMR did not enhance lactational performance (milk production, composition, DMI, or body weight changes) when fed a high-forage TMR but altered ruminal fermentation with decreased ruminal ammonia and increased ruminal acetate concentrations.

J		Casquete, R.; Velazquez, R.; Hernandez, A.; Cordoba, M. de G.; Aranda, E.; Bartolome, T.; Martin, A.							Evaluation of the quality and shelf-life of cayenne (Capsicum spp.).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A genetic characterization of 13 species of cayenne provided by Spanish milling industries was performed, and their colour, pungency and antioxidant properties were evaluated. Colour parameters (carotenoids, reflected and extractable colour), capsaicinoids, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity by the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging method and 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) were determined in the cayenne samples, and the stability of cayenne properties was determined after exposure to UV light. Genetic characterization using different barcode markers (26S large subunit of rDNA, internal transcribed spacer 2, rbcL gene and matK gene) revealed close relationships among samples. However, notable differences were found for most of the quality parameters studied. Specifically, colour parameters were the most important traits for the discrimination of different samples. Samples with high colour quality presented 989.9 mug of capsanthin/g of dry matter, 104.8 ASTA units and 26.6 units in the a* coordinate of the CIELAB space. In contrast, the lowest-quality sample presented 582.7 mug of capsanthin/g of dry matter, 21.1 ASTA units and 15.4 units in the a* coordinate. DPPH and ABTS values ranged from 73.8 to 161.8 and from 217.1 to 325.7 mg Trolox/100 g, respectively. Pungency was highly variable among samples, with values ranging between 68.2 and 751.9 mug of capsaicin/g and 38.7 and 273.5 mug of dihidrocapsaicin/g. Principal component analysis indicated that capsaicinoids and total phenolic compounds are the best indices to determine the antioxidant activity of cayenne, which is highly correlated with the stability of colour and pungency. According to these findings, the desirable technological qualities and the longest shelf-life of cayenne are associated with a high content of capsaicinoids and phenolic compounds, which guarantee good colour stability and pungency associated with high antioxidant activity.

The effects of sulphur dioxide on wine metabolites: new insights from 1H NMR spectroscopy based in-situ screening, detection, identification and quantification.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The wine industry routinely employs sulphur dioxide (SO2) as an additive for antiseptic, antioxidasic and antioxidant activities. Some of the most important wine metabolites such as acetaldehyde, diacetyl, pyruvic acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, hydroxymethylfurfural, furfural and acetoin are known to react with SO2 over time to form adducts. 1H NMR spectroscopy of wine can be tricky as metabolites exist either in original form or as O-adducts or as S-adducts at different SO2 concentrations. We are proposing a methodology for metabolites identification including all the possible SO2 generated species. 1H NMR spectroscopy is able to highlight the structural changes that a metabolite undergoes in wine in the presence of SO2. The 1H NMR spectra of the main wine metabolites known to react with SO2 were recorded in wine-model solutions at SO2 concentrations at 0,50, 100 and 150 mg/L that are all below the maximum level allowed by the European Union regulations. Acetaldehyde was completely transformed into the corresponding hydroxysulfonate at a SO2 concentration of 100 mg/L. The concentration of this metabolite was assayed in ten commercial Moscato wine samples including the 1H NMR resonances of all its identified forms. The results corresponded to those determined according to the OIV standard protocols. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cassol, L.; Norena, C. P. Z.							Microencapsulation and accelerated stability testing of bioactive compounds of Hibiscus sabdariffa.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The aim of this study was to encapsulate hibiscus aqueous extract, which has valuable content in anthocyanins with antioxidant activity. For this purpose, assays were realized using whey protein isolate and polydextrose and a mixture of both as carriers by spray-drying and freeze-drying encapsulation. Statistical analysis indicated that the powder containing only polydextrose by freeze-drying presented the best condition of encapsulation, with retentions of phenolic, anthocyanin and antioxidant activity measured by ABTS, DPPH, and HRSA of 86,77, 76,90 and 74%, respectively. Accelerated stability tests (75 and 90% relative humidity, at 40 and 60 °C) performed for 30 days in the powders, showed two periods of losses for polyphenols and antioxidant capacity: a significant decrease (p<0.05) and its posterior stabilization in all storage conditions. In order to predict the degradation kinetic of anthocyanins encapsulated was used the first-order kinetic model, whose degradation rate constants ranged from 0.0259 to 0.2910 d-1, and increased with the temperature and relative humidity, with the Q10 temperature coefficient values from 1.1 to 2.1. FTIR and TGA assays indicated that the encapsulation occurred by physical incorporation, as well as up to 210 °C, powders presented high thermal stability. The results suggested that the powders may be used as a bioactive ingredient due to its high solubility and thermal stability. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Colon bioaccessibility under in vitro gastrointestinal digestion of different coffee brews chemically profiled through UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS.		Foods					Coffee represents one of the most traditionally consumed beverages worldwide, containing a broad range of human health-related compounds. According to previous studies, regular coffee consumption may display protective effects against colorectal cancer and other chronic diseases. The main goal of this research was to evaluate the bioaccessibility of phenolic content and variation in antioxidant capacity of three different types of coffee brews after simulated gastrointestinal digestion. This would allow to elucidate how antioxidant compounds present in coffee may exert their effect on the human body, especially in the colonic stage. Moreover, the content of bioactive compounds namely chlorogenic acids (CGAs, n=11) and caffeine was also assessed throughout ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography followed by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Orbitrap HRMS). The three main isomers of caffeoylquinic acid constituted the highest fraction of CGAs present in the samples, accounting for 66.0% to 70.9% of total CGAs. The bioaccessibility of coffee polyphenols significantly increased in digested samples from 45.9% to 62.9% at the end of the colonic passage, compared to the non-digested samples. These results point to the colonic stage as the major biological site of action of the active antioxidant coffee compounds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

In vitro bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity of polyphenolic compounds from spent coffee grounds-enriched cookies.		Foods					Spent coffee ground (SCG) is a significant by-product generated by the coffee industry. It is considered a great source of bioactive molecules well-recognized for exerting biological properties. This study aimed to implement SCG in a baked foods, such as cookies (SCGc), to increase their bioactive potential. A comprehensive study of the polyphenolic fraction of the SCG and SCGc using a high-resolution mass spectrometry analysis was performed. Moreover, the polyphenol bioaccessibility and change in antioxidant activity during simulated gastrointestinal digestion (GiD) were assessed. Data showed that SCGc provided 780 mg of melanoidins, 16.2 mg of chlorogenic acid (CGA), 6.5 mg of caffeine, and 0.08 mg of phenolic acids per 100 g of sample. Moreover, the 5-caffeoylquinic acid was the most relevant CGA found in SCG (116.4 mg/100 g) and SCGc (8.2 mg/100 g) samples. The antioxidant activity evaluated through three spectrophotometric tests, and the total phenolic compounds of SCGc samples exhibited significantly higher values than the control samples. Furthermore, during simulated GiD, the highest bioaccessibility of SCGc polyphenols was observed after the colonic stage, suggesting their potential advantages for human health. Therefore, SCG with high content in bioactive molecules could represent an innovative ingredient intended to fortify baked food formulations. © 2021 by the authors.

Alternaria in malting barley: characterization and distribution in relation with climatic conditions and barley cultivars.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Alternaria is one of the main fungal genera affecting the quality of barley grains. In this study, a polyphasic approach was carried out to characterise the Alternaria population infecting different cultivars of barley grains from the major producing regions of Argentina in the 2014 and 2015 seasons. Its relationship with Fusarium and correlations between predominant species, barley cultivars, and climatic conditions in the growing regions were evaluated. Alternaria incidence exceeded that of Fusarium in all the barley samples and was higher in the drier season (21% in 2014 and 42% in 2015 vs. 6% and 4%, respectively). The main Alternaria species-groups identified were present in both growing seasons in similar frequencies (A. tenuissima sp.-grp., 83.4% in 2014 and 81.7% in 2015; A. infectoria sp. -grp., 11.7% in 2014 and 11.3% in 2015). The dominant Alternaria species-group isolated and identified based on morphological characteristics, DNA sequencing, and metabolite profile was A. tenuissima (72.9%), followed by A. infectoria (14.6%). An association between their frequency and field temperature was observed; A. tenuissima sp.-grp. Was more frequent in northern localities, where higher temperatures were registered, while the opposite was observed for A. infectoria sp.-grp. A smaller percentage of A. arborescens sp.-grp. (5%), A. alternata sp.-grp. (3.9%) and A. vaccinii (1.4%) were also identified. Both secondary metabolite profiles and phylogenetic analysis were useful to distinguish isolates from Alternaria section Alternaria and section infectoriae. Regarding metabolite profiles, alternariol was the most frequent compound produced by isolates of the section Alternaria. Infectopyrones and novae-zelandins were produced by most of the isolates from section infectoriae. The barley cultivars analysed in this study did not show a particular susceptibility regarding the Alternaria population composition, except for Andreia, which presented the highest frequency of contamination with A. tenuissima sp.-grp. The rest of the cultivars, when grown in different regions, showed different proportion of the Alternaria sp.-grps., suggesting that other factors were determinant in their distribution. The results obtained in the present study will be a valuable tool for health authorities to assess the need for regulations on Alternaria mycotoxins, given the high incidence of Alternaria spp. In barley and the diversity of metabolites that might contaminate the grains.

Ultrasound use as a pretreatment for shrimp (Litopenaeusvannamei) dehydration and its effect on physicochemical, microbiological, structural, and rehydration properties.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Alternative pretreatments to food materials are necessary to enhance the dehydration process and improve the quality of products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ultrasound pretreatments on the dehydration behavior and quality characteristics of dehydrated shrimp. Shrimps were ultrasonicated in a salt solution (10%) at 4 °C for 15 and 30 min in an ultrasonic bath (130 W, 40 kHz) and then dehydrated and their kinetics modeled. The ultrasound pretreatments for 15 and 20 min diminished the dehydration time by 15.6% and 12.1%, respectively, in comparison with the control treatments, being the Page model the one that best described the dehydration kinetics. The content of ash significantly increased (p<.05) and the water activity (aw) significantly decreased (p<.05), while some rehydration quality indices also raised in the dehydrated shrimps pretreated with ultrasound in comparison with controls. Ultrasound can potentially be applied for shrimp dehydration, given the advantages in reducing processing time and improving product quality. Practical applications. Shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei) is a nutritious seafood that is appreciated for its delicious meat, which represents 53% of the world's aquaculture production of crustaceans. Unfortunately, shrimp like many foods is highly perishable; hence, different processing technologies must be applied to improve its useful life. At present, drying is the main applied method in the aquatic product processing industry, but depending of the applied conditions, changes may occur that affect the quality of the product. Pretreatments such as the ultrasound improved the dehydration process and the quality of the dehydrated shrimp. Therefore, such conditions could be used to produce ready-to-eat food from shrimp, as is currently demanded by consumers. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Ultrasound extraction conditions effect on antioxidant capacity of mango by-product extracts.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Phenolic compounds are bioactive compounds that can be used in food preservation. During this experiment, phenolic compounds were extracted from "Haden" mango seed and peel flour using ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE). The results demonstrated high efficiency of the UAE for obtaining phenolic compounds in seed (121.66 4.94 mg GAE/g DM), and peel (112.90 3.70 94 mg GAE/g). For seed extracts the antioxidant activity ranged from 64.04 to 514.50 mg TE/g for DPPH, 297 to 1051.87 mg TE/g for ABTS, and 24 to 685.96 mg TE/g DM in the ability to reduce Fe3+ ion. In the case of peels, values of ABTS ranged from 239.13 to 1155.83 mg TE/g, DPPH ranged from 65.86 to 249.30 mg TE/g, and FRAP ranged from 7.11 to 100.89 mg TE/g. In the specific case of ABTS, the extracts could stabilize the ABTS and DPPH radicals and reduce Fe3+. The antiradical activity of the extracts suggests that peels may have a higher concentration of hydrophobic compounds that efficiently stabilize the ABTS radical, but that do not have a great effect against the DPPH radical and the Fe3+. Variations in the solvent concentration and the solvent-solid ratio generate changes in antioxidant capacity evaluated by different methods. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Castejon, N.; Luna, P.; Senorans, F. J.							Microencapsulation by spray drying of omega-3 lipids extracted from oilseeds and microalgae: effect on polyunsaturated fatty acid composition.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this work, microencapsulation of omega-3 lipids from sustainable sources, including oilseeds such as Salvia hispanica L., Echium plantagineum L. and Camelina sativa L., microalgal lipids (from Nannochloropsis gaditana) and enzymatically produced fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs), was successfully done by spray drying and their outcomes studied. Previous to microencapsulation process, lipid extracts from new omega-3 sources (chia, camelina and echium oilseeds and wet microalgal biomass of Nannochloropsis) were produced using Pressurized Liquid Extraction. The best microencapsulation efficiency was achieved for chia FAEEs (76.9%), while the lowest was obtained for camelina oil (58.8%) and Nannochloropsis gaditana lipids (57.0%) microcapsules, which also showed low emulsion stability. Analysis by GC-MS showed that microencapsulation process did not negatively affect omega-3 fatty acid profile of microencapsulated extracts. The percentage of omega-3 in each used lipid was similar before and after spray drying (no significant differences at 5% level). Under the optimal conditions, produced microcapsules ranged from 1.5 to 30 mum and showed spherical shape and smooth surface without cracks. Thus, the proposed method provides an original approach to produce omega-3 microencapsulated lipid extracts from different nature, with high microencapsulation efficiency and payload, for potential applications in the development of foods enriched in omega-3 fatty acids.

Foods					Over the last two years, many countries have enforced confinement to limit both the spread of COVID-19 and the demand for medical care. Confinement has resulted in a disruption of work routines, boredom, depression, and changes in eating habits, among them consumption of coffee and tea. Following six databases, we examined articles tracking consumption of these beverages. Out of 472 articles, including 23 beverage entries, 13 matched our criteria. While no clear trend in coffee consumption during the coronavirus pandemic emerged (7 of 13 studies indicated an increase, accounting for 53.8%), tea consumption clearly increased (70% versus 30%). Considering the global health emergency continuum, more research is needed to better understand the paths underlying food choices and the ways those changes may influence health outcomes, including those related to COVID-19 disease. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect of different closure types and storage temperatures on the color and sensory characteristics development of Argentinian Torrontes Riojano white wines aged in bottles.		Food Control					During aging, most bottled white wines lose their distinctive organoleptic characteristics according to their storage conditions (closure, temperature, time). However, the effect of these factors on organoleptic characteristics of Torrontes Riojano wines (TRw) has not been studied yet. This study aimed at evaluating the combined effect of closure type and storage temperature on the organoleptic properties development of TRw over a 18-month aging period, during which wine was bottled with natural (C) and synthetic (SyC) corks, and screwcaps (SC). Bottles were kept 18 months in thermostatized chambers (15°C; 25°C). At different aging times, consumed oxygen (CO), SO2, total phenols (TP), color, and sensory properties were evaluated. CO, TP, and browning index evolutions depended on the interaction between closure and temperature, whereas CIELAB parameters (lightness, chroma, hue) depended on closure-time and temperature-time interactions. At both storage temperatures, SC had a lower hue decrease and a lower chroma increase than C and SyC. The highest temperature prompted a more yellow and darker color of TRw. Thus, it allowed discrimination throughout the process. Considering the aging process, their aromatic intensity, fresh fruit, and yellow and green nuances decreased, while brown hue, color intensity, linalool, and oxidized character rose as their storage time was increased. At the end of their aging, TRw kept to 15°C were not differenced by closure, and they were characterized by their fresh fruit, floral, and high aromatic intensity attributes. At 25°C, SyC presented higher color intensity and herbaceous characters, while C and SC showed a more oxidized character. In conclusion, the interaction closure type-storage temperature is critical for organoleptic stability properties of bottled TRw during aging. Thus, screwcaps and low-temperature storage conditions can preserve the TRw varietal characteristics, increasing their shelf-life significantly. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

EFSA Journal					The European Commission asked EFSA to evaluate the efficacy of an infant formula, containing a specific protein hydrolysate derived from whey protein isolate and concentrate and manufactured by Societe des Produits Nestle S. A., in reducing the risk of developing atopic dermatitis in infants with a family history of allergy. This was following the submission of a dossier by Societe des Produits Nestle S. A. To the European Commission, in the context of Regulation (EU) 2016/127. The protein hydrolysate from which the infant formula is produced is included in Annex I and II of Commission delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/127 as suitable protein source for the manufacture of infant and follow-on formulae. This opinion does not cover the assessment of the nutritional safety and suitability of the infant formula or the safety of the food enzymes used in the manufacture of the protein hydrolysate. The Panel considers that, in relation to the effect that is claimed, the infant formula under evaluation is not sufficiently characterised with respect to the molecular weight distribution of peptides. From the human intervention studies submitted, no conclusions could be drawn on the efficacy of the infant formula in reducing the risk of developing atopic dermatitis. The Panel concludes that a cause-and-effect relationship has not been established between the consumption of the infant formula under evaluation and the reduction in the risk of developing atopic dermatitis in infants with a family history of allergy. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

A case study on farmed European seabass and gilthead seabream in central Italy: the negligible parasitological risk of nematode larvae paves the way for the freezing derogation.		Food Control					Gilthead seabream and European seabass are among the most appreciated farmed fish species in the European Union. This case study analysed the self-control plan procedures adopted in an offshore cage farm in Central Italy to prevent anisakids infection, in the light of the Anisakis contamination pathways previously proposed for farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), and of the criteria recommended by the European Food Safety Authority. Moreover, the results of the visual parasitological examination conducted by the Food Business Operator, as part of the self-control plan, on 5% of the total specimens with commercial size (2016-2020 period) were also considered. Results show an extremely low to negligible risk for the introduction of ascaridoid larvae, confirming the absence of these parasites in farmed specimens of both species. However, few implementations to the self-control plan are suggested for obtaining the derogation to preventive freezing, as established by the European legislation. These include the parasitological examination of a statistically significant sample of the farmed specimens (commercial sizes) conducted by trained personnel, as well as of farmed specimens found dead or underdeveloped (runts) and of wild specimens of other species which may enter the cages. The proposed approach can be adapted by other farms by adjusting the sample size based on the production volume and risk categorization. The exemption from the preventive freezing would represent an additional market opportunity for Italian aquaculture plants. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Dairy Research					Artisanal unripened cheeses produced in northwestern Parana, Brazil, were studied for microbiological quality and sensory quality. The cheeses analyzed showed high counts of aerobic mesophilic microorganisms and S. aureus. However, even with the results showing poor microbiological quality, from a sensory point of view, consumers considered cheeses acceptable (high acceptance index). The results may indicate that there is still a lack of training and knowledge of production procedures to reduce microbiological contamination of artisanal cheese produced in northwestern Parana. © The Author(s), 2021.

Effects of a Myrciaria jaboticaba peel extract on starch and triglyceride absorption and the role of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside.		Food & Function					The purpose of this study was to perform a parallel and comparative investigation of the effects of a Myrciaria jaboticaba (common name jabuticaba) peel extract and of its constituent cyanidin-3-O-glucoside on the overall process of starch and triglyceride intestinal absorption. The peel extract inhibited both the porcine pancreactic alpha-amylase and the pancreatic lipase but was 13.6 times more potent on the latter (IC50 values of 1963 and 143.9 mug mL-1, respectively). Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside did not contribute significantly to these inhibitions. The jabuticaba peel extract inhibited starch absorption in mice at doses that were compatible with its inhibitory action on the alpha-amylase. No inhibition of starch absorption was found with cyanidin-3-O-glucoside doses compatible with its content in the extract. The extract also inhibited triglyceride absorption, but at doses that were considerably smaller than those predicted by its strength in inhibiting the pancreatic lipase (ID50=3.65 mg kg-1). In this case, cyanidin-3-O-glucoside was also strongly inhibitory, with 72% inhibition at the dose of 2 mg kg-1. When oleate+ glycerol were given to mice, both the peel extract and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside strongly inhibited the appearance of triglycerides in the plasma. The main mechanism seems, thus, not to be the lipase inhibition but rather the inhibition of one or more steps (e.g., transport) in the events that lead to the transformation of free fatty acids in the intestinal tract into triglycerides. Due to the low active doses, the jabuticaba peel extract presents many favourable perspectives as an inhibitor of fat absorption and cyanidin-3-O-glucoside seems to play a decisive role. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Food Chemistry					After more than ten years since pesticide residues were detected in citrus-flavored soft drinks, this study reveals that the situation has not changed. A new sensitive multiresidue UHPLC-MS/MS method has been validated for 88 pesticides, which was used to analyze 200 samples manufactured in 67 countries, 80% corresponding to fruit-based soft drinks. The results show that 98% of the samples collected worldwide contained at least one pesticide, and 85% of them contained more than 4 pesticides. 40 out of 88 target compounds were quantified among the screened samples. Europe was the world region with the highest total amount of pesticides, probably due to the higher content of juice concentrate in samples, which may be the main source of the pesticide residues. Nevertheless, residues were also found in samples with no juice, so water quality also plays an important role as the main ingredient of citrus-flavored soft drinks. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Determination of atropine and scopolamine in spinach-based products contaminated with genus Datura by UHPLC-MS/MS.		Food Chemistry					Datura species are well known because of their high concentration of tropane alkaloids, which has led to poisoning episodes when Datura is accidentally mixed with edible crops. Therefore, the European Union has set a maximum level in cereal-based infant food products of 1 g kg-1 for atropine and scopolamine. However, the occurrence of these compounds in other commodities has become a global concern. Spinach and derived products can be contaminated with Datura innoxia leaves. In this study, we tested frozen spinachs and spinach-based infant food products. The determination was carried out by UHPLC-MS/MS after applying the QuEChERS method as sample treatment. The LOQs were below 0.016 g kg-1, achieving satisfactory results in terms of precision, accuracy, and matrix effects. The obtained results (ranging between 0.02 and 8.19 g kg-1) were close to the maximum level set by the European Union for 24% of the samples tested. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Assessment of a specific sample cleanup for the multiresidue determination of veterinary drugs and pesticides in salmon using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry.		Food Control					A novel sample treatment approach based on a modified QuEChERS method was evaluated for the simultaneous determination of veterinary drug and pesticide residues in salmon in this work. To improve the QuEChERS performance, Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid dSPE cleanup sorbent was evaluated for the first time for the simultaneous analysis of these organic contaminants in salmon samples. Due to this sorbent can effectively remove coextracted families of lipids. To cover a wide range of polarities, 65 pesticides and 41 veterinary drugs with log Kow ranging from -1.4 to 5.5 were selected. Extracts after cleanup were analyzed by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for analyte confirmation and quantitation. Outstanding results were obtained for both extraction efficiency and matrix removal. A negligible matrix effect was obtained for 57% of the studied compounds, whereas the rest presented a soft matrix effect. The recovery for spiked samples was in agreement with the current European Union recommendations for most compounds. The rest of the parameters were also satisfactory, reaching quantification limits lower than 3.7 mug kg-1 in all cases. The precision was better than 20% in all cases. Finally, the method performance was successfully demonstrated with 20 salmon samples, five of which contained pesticide or veterinary drug residues. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Postharvest yellow LED lighting affects phenolics and glucosinolates biosynthesis in broccoli sprouts.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Nowadays, literature is still limited on the effects that LEDs may trigger during postharvest. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of continuous monochromatic Yellow or Green light on total and individual phenolic and glucosinolate content of 9-day broccoli sprouts stored up to 15 days at 5°C as a ready-to-eat product. In addition, a broad-spectrum White LED light, a Fluorescent light and storage in Darkness were used as treatments. An improvement in the total phenolic content (TPC) of 15% and 13% was observed under Yellow and White LED lighting, respectively, throughout the shelf-life as compared to Darkness. While Green LEDs did not affect the TPC, an increase of 34.5% on the total glucosinolate content (TGC) was associated to this treatment on day 4. The highest increase of the TGC was observed under Yellow lighting (77%, compared to Darkness). In contrast, Fluorescent and Darkness did not affect the TPC, but reduced the TGC (69 and 62% compared to values at harvest, respectively). Our study demonstrates that a postharvest Yellow LED lighting stimulates the TPC and the TGC accumulation, opening the way for its further applications along the shelf life of other horticultural commodities.

Postharvest LED lighting: effect of red, blue and far red on quality of minimally processed broccoli sprouts.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The main objective of this study was to evaluate physiological and quality changes of minimally processed broccoli sprouts illuminated during postharvest storage under blue, red and far-red LED lighting as compared to darkness or illumination with fluorescent light, as control treatments. Results. Morphological and microbiological changes were determined during 15days at 5 °C. In addition, total antioxidant activity and bioactive compound changes throughout the shelf life were also monitored. Results. Showed that far-red LED lighting increased hypocotyl and sprout length, decreased microbial growth and improved the total antioxidant and scavenging activities, compared to darkness and fluorescent lighting treatments. However, it did not stimulate the biosynthesis of phenolic acids. In contrast, blue LED light reduced by 50% the total antioxidant capacity of broccoli sprouts compared to far-red treatment, as well as morphological development. In addition, total scavenging activity was increased under far-red LED light compared with the other treatments by 12-10% (darkness and fluorescence) and 33-31% (blue and red LEDs). Conclusions. Our results suggest that minimally processed sprouts may benefit from LED lighting during shelf life in terms of quality, although further experiments should be conducted to optimize a proper exposure cycle and intensity aiming for use in the distribution chain. The results also open the way for further development towards the integration of this technology in the food distribution chain. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Foods					The consumption of local agricultural products boosts the regional economy and employment whilst preserving the rural landscape and environment. In this research, the background of local wine consumption behaviour will be studied, using an extended model of the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to test the hypotheses. The study was conducted in the Canary Islands with a sample of 762 people. The results confirmed a relationship between intention and perceived behavioural control. Furthermore, the ethnocentric personality was found to have a positive influence and the cosmopolitan personality a negative influence. The personal norm and place identity were also confirmed to be related to attitudes towards such behaviour. This study contributes to the literature by adding constructs to this theory that are relevant to local wine consumption. It also addresses the implications for those involved in the marketing of local products. © 2021 by the authors.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. To examine the effects of myo-inositol supplementation during lactation in male and female rats on metabolic parameters and its potential to reverse metabolic alterations associated with a moderate gestational calorie restriction. Methods and results. The offspring of control and 25% gestational calorie-restricted rats are supplemented with myo-inositol or vehicle throughout lactation and exposed to a Western diet (WD) from 5 to 7 months of age. Blood parameters are measured and gene expression and protein levels in retroperitoneal white adipose tissue (rWAT) and liver are analyzed. In male offspring, but not in females, myo-inositol supplementation resulted in lower fasting triglyceride and insulin levels and HOMA-IR at 7 months, and reversed the alterations in these parameters due to gestational calorie restriction. The expression pattern of key genes in metabolism in rWAT and liver support the beneficial effect of myo-inositol supplementation in reversing metabolic alterations programmed by gestational calorie restriction in male rats. Conclusions. Myo-inositol supplementation at physiological doses during lactation improves metabolic health and prevents the programmed trend to develop insulin resistance and hypertriglyceridemia in male rats acquired by inadequate fetal nutrition and exacerbated by a diabetogenic diet in adulthood. The absence of clear effects in females deserves further investigation. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Fine tuning European geographic quality labels, an opportunity for horticulture diversification: a tentative proposal for the Spanish case.		Food Control					European horticulture, especially in the southern states, must exploit new qualities to increase the added value of its vegetables. This article aims to analyze the situation of the European geographical quality labels Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) to ascertain whether they are useful for this purpose. To this end, we studied the registers of the current horticultural products awarded PDO or PGI status, and we surveyed the authorities responsible for managing the labels for these products. We found that protected labels have grown steadily since their inception about thirty years ago, becoming a powerful mechanism for landrace conservation and a source of added benefits. The strongest points in the management of these labels include anchoring the products in the local history and culture roots and defining the prominent characteristics of their external appearance, and the weakest points are the lack of information about chemical traits and especially about sensory traits (texture, odor, taste). To strengthen PDO and PGI labels, we propose increasing the requirements for sensory descriptions, homogenizing protocols for analyzing sensory traits, incorporating methods combining trained sensory panels and instrumental methods such as spectroscopy, and involving public administrations in both obtaining and managing the labels. As an example of the potential impact of European geographical labels on territorial rebalancing and the organization of European horticulture, we propose a panoply of products in Spain that are good candidates for protected status.

Interactions between polyphenol oxidation products and salivary proteins: specific affinity of CQA dehydrodimers with cystatins and P-B peptide.		Food Chemistry					Throughout the apple juice and cider making process, polyphenols undergo enzymatic oxidation which generates a great variety of polyphenol oxidation products. Since 5′-O-Caffeoylquinic acid (CQA) is one of the major phenolic compounds and the preferential substrate for polyphenoloxidase in apple juice, its oxidation leads to the formation of newly formed molecules by which dehydrodimers (MW 706 Da) are included. Interactions of salivary proteins (SP) with native polyphenols is a well-known phenomenon, but their interactions with polyphenol oxidation products has not been studied yet. In this work, we decided to decipher the interactions between CQA dehydrodimers and SP (gPRPs, aPRPs, statherins/P-B peptide, and cystatins) using HPLC-UV and fluorescence. These results showed that contrary to what was expected, CQA dehydrodimers presented a low interaction with PRPs, but revealed a specific interaction with statherins/P-B peptide and cystatins. This work settles for the first time the interactions between SP and polyphenol oxidation products.

Impact of osmotic dehydration and different drying methods on the texture and sensory characteristic of sweet corn kernels.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The main aim of the study was to examine the quality and properties of sweet corn kernels treated by osmotic dehydration (OD) and different drying methods. Drying kinetics, texture profile analysis (TPA), color, and a descriptive sensory analysis were performed in the study. The study found that the use of vacuum-microwave drying (VMD) as a part of the drying process had a significant impact on the formation of crispy characteristic of the sample. Also, application of OD performed in concentrated apple juice followed by drying resulted in a fruitier, not that crispy, but juicier material when compared with non-OD samples. At the end, VMD was selected as optimal for production of crunchy sweet corn kernels, whereas OD/VMD was recommended for obtaining juicier, less crunchy material with improved taste as a result of OD. Practical applications. Corn is one of the most popular crops in the world and is commonly used in the production of snacks. However, traditional snacks are often unhealthy due to the increased amount of fat. Drying can be used to obtain healthy, crispy products. Moreover, osmotic dehydration can be used to modify the sensory characteristic of the dried product. This study analyzes different drying methods with their impact on the texture of the sweet corn kernels as well as sensory analysis. Assessed process conditions can be helpful in designing and obtaining corn snacks that are not only healthy but also acceptable by consumers. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The decrease in the health benefits of extra virgin olive oil during storage is conditioned by the initial phenolic profile.		Food Chemistry					Phenols are responsible for the only health claim of virgin olive oil (VOO) recognized by the European Commission EU 432/2012 and the European Food Safety Authority. In this research, we studied the decrease in the phenolic content of 160 extra VOOs (EVOOs) after 12 months storage in darkness at 20 °C. Phenolic concentration was decreased 42.024.3% after this period and this reduction strongly depended on the initial phenolic profile. Hence, EVOOs with predominance in oleacein and oleocanthal experienced a larger decrease in phenolic content than oils enriched in other phenols. Complementarily, hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthalic acid increased significantly in aged EVOOs, which allowed their discrimination from recently produced EVOOs. These changes are explained by degradation of main secoiridoids during storage due to their antioxidant properties. Hydroxytyrosol and oleocanthalic acid can be considered markers of olive oil ageing, although they can also provide information about quality or stability. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Identification of the thistle milk component Silibinin(A) and Glutathione-disulphide as potential inhibitors of the pancreatic lipase: potential implications on weight loss.		Journal of Functional Foods					Peripheral targets like pancreatic-lipase appear to be the most suitable pharmacological alternative for obesity, as with orlistat, although its adverse effects limit its use. Therefore, the aim of this work was to identify new natural compounds able to inhibit pancreatic-lipase in an in vitro model. The DrugBank database was used to perform docking calculations. The best fitting-score compounds were further evaluated in vitro. Our data revealed that glutathione-disulphide (GSSG) and silibinin (A) inhibit pancreatic-lipase. This was confirmed by measuring hydrolysis in an emulsion model, obtaining that the suppression of lipid digestion by silibinin (A) was higher than that of GSSG and close to the effect of orlistat. Combined analysis established the existence of different inhibition mechanisms for each compound. In summary, silibinin (A) and GSSG inhibited pancreatic-lipase and, therefore, may be served as promise natural compounds to face with obesity. Further studies comprise the next step to fully validate the suitability of these compounds.

J		Castillo-Valero, J. S.; Carrasco, I.; Carchano, M.; Corcoles, C.							What is the environmental impact of wine entering global value chains? Studying the evolution of CO2 emissions from the export of Spanish denomination of origin wines.		Foods					The continuous growth of the international wine trade and the expansion of international markets is having significant commercial, but also environmental impacts. The benefits of vineyards in terms of ecosystem service provision are offset by the increase in CO2 emissions generated by transportation. Denominations of Origin, as quality labels, emphasise a wine's links to the terroir, where specific elements of culture and environment merge together. However, Denominations of Origin can also have differentiating elements as regards environmental performance. Drawing on an extended multiregional input-output model applied to the Spanish Denominations of Origin with the largest presence in the international wine trade, this study shows that wines with the greatest exporting tradition are those that most reduced their carbon footprint per litre of exported wine in the period 2005-2018, thus being the most environmentally efficient. © 2021 by the authors.

Use of high-power ultrasound combined with supercritical fluids for microbial inactivation in dry-cured ham.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The aim of this study was to analyze the application of supercritical carbon dioxide combined with high-power ultrasound (SC-CO2+ HPU) and the use of a saline solution (SS; 0.85% NaCl) on the microbial inactivation and the quality of dry-cured ham. The effect of temperature, pressure and treatment time was studied using RSM. Physicochemical analyses were carried out after the treatments and during refrigerated storage (30 days / 4 °C). The most significant inactivation of Escherichia coli (3.620.20-log CFU/g) was obtained using the SC-CO2+ HPU+ SS (25 MPa, 46-°C and 10-min), with temperature being the most important process variable. Fat content showed a significant (p< 0.05) reduction (46%) after the SC-CO2+ HPU treatment. The breakage of the muscle fibers, the disorganization in the myofibrils, as well as the enlargement of the interfibrillar spaces led to the ham softening (avg 26.5%). No significant (p> 0.05) changes in color, texture or pH were found during storage. Thus, ultrasonic-assisted SC-CO2 could be used, in combination or not with SS, to improve the shelf of dry-cured ham. Industrial relevance Supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO2) inactivation technology has been shown to be highly efficient at reducing different bacteria in liquid media with minimum effect on food quality. This technology is barely applied to solid products and its use is limited by the long processing times and reduced inactivation capacity. The application of high-power ultrasound (HPU) leads to a shorter process time. This technology is useful for the inactivation of ham microbiota and inoculated E. coli. A liquid medium surrounding the treated solid can enhance microbial inactivation for the purposes of improving the effect of ultrasound cavitation, while only minimally affecting the quality of the samples (color, texture, fat and moisture contents).

J		Castrica, M.; Menchetti, L.; Panseri, S.; Cami, M.; Balzaretti, C. M.							When pet snacks look like children's toys! The potential role of pet snacks in transmission of bacterial zoonotic pathogens in the household.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Recent foodborne pathogen outbreaks associated with dry pet food and treats have focused the attention on these products as vehicles of pathogens for both pets and their owners. This study investigates the purchasing habits of dog owners and determines if and in what form pet snacks can be potentially dangerous for humans, especially for children. For these purposes, questionnaires collected from 406 dog owners were evaluated and microbiological analyses were performed on 120 dry pet snacks. The shape of the pet snack affects the purchase (median score, Mdn = 6.4) and the star bone was the preferred one (Mdn = 7.1). Most of the participants (76.0%; p < 0.001) stated that snacks are attractive to their children and that the possibility for children to get in contact with pet snacks is rare, but not implausible (Mdn = 3.1). Indeed, more than 6% of respondents admitted that there had been incidents of involuntary ingestion of pet snacks, with fever and gastrointestinal manifestations. Microbiological analyses showed that 119 dry pet snacks analyzed of a total of 120 (99.2%) were in good sanitary condition except for one sample where the presence of Listeria ivanovii was confirmed. The upward trend in the presence of pets in households and the strong and continuous growth in value and volume of the pet food market led researchers to analyze possible public health issues. Children and infants in particular are the most exposed subjects as they are more likely to come into contact with pet snacks, attracted by a shape similar to that of a toy. For this reason, although our findings did not highlight important microbiological contamination of pet snacks, it would be useful to standardize food safety criteria with those for human food from a One Health perspective.

Effect of high-pressure processing on physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory traits in fresh fish fillets (Salmo salar and Pleuronectes platessa).		Foods					High-pressure (HP) treatment could lead to several advantages when applied to fish and seafood since it would affect the extension of the shelf life of this highly perishable food. In this regard, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of high-pressure treatment (500 MPa for 2 min at a temperature of 4°C) on changes in quality on two different kinds of fresh fish fillets (Salmo salar and Pleuronectes platessa). Specifically, physico-chemical (VOCs, untargeted metabolomics spectra, pH and color), microbiological (Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp., mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria) and sensory traits were evaluated at different days of refrigerated storage. From the results obtained, it is possible to state that the high pressure significantly (p≤ 0.05) reduced microbial growth for each investigated microorganism. Regarding the colorimetric coordinates, no remarkable effects on a* and b* indices were found, while a significant effect (p= 0.01) was observed on the colorimetric index L*, making the HP-treated samples lighter than their respective controls. The sensory analysis showed that for the odor attribute, the HP treatment seems to have had a stabilizing action during shelf-life. Moreover, the treated samples obtained a better score than the respective controls (p ≤ 0.05). With regards to texture and appearance attributes, the treatment seems to have had a significant (p≤ 0.05) effect, making the treated samples more compact and opaque than controls, therefore resulting in the loss of the characteristics of raw fish for the treated samples. Moreover, from a chemical point of view, HP treatment prevents the development of volatile sulfides and delays the formation of histamine (p ≤ 0.05). Very interestingly, the metabolomic approach revealed novel dipeptide markers for the HP procedure. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Rapid safety and quality control during fish shelf-life by using a portable device.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Fish consumption is increasing nowadays both because of its positive role for health due to the abundant presence of unsaturated fatty acids and for its use in many new food preparations (e.g.raw fillet used for uncooked sushi and sashimi dishes). The growing food industry and increased demand for the long-term storage and preservation of food have created the need to develop methods that can easily track and preserve food freshness and safety throughout shelf-life (production, storage, shipment, and consumption). While E-nose technologies have already been used and tested for these purposes, scarce information is available in the literature on the feasibility of using other food devices to detect changes in perishable food like fish during shelf-life in order to predict and correctly manage all food storage phases. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of Food Sniffer portable devices to define the quality and safety of salmon fillet and burger (Salmo salar) packaged in modified atmosphere at two refrigerated conditions (4 and 8 °C). Results. An increase in biogenic amines and volatile compounds especially ketones and alcohols were observed, with large amounts at final storage times of 8 °C temperature. Conclusion. The Food Sniffer application was able to anticipate unacceptability conditions of salmon samples also correlated with chemical and microbiological parameters. This could represent a valid support for food industry and retail to manage perishable food commodities preventing possible food risk as well. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Evaluation of the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 (ATCC VR-1986HK) on two different food contact materials: flow pack polyethylene and polystyrene food trays.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Even though SARS-CoV-2's primary transmission pathway is person-to-person, the role played by surfaces and food contact materials in carrying viral RNA should be further explored. For this purpose, the study aimed to investigate the persistence of SARS-CoV-2 using the strain ATCC VR-1986HK on flow pack polyethylene (FPP) and polystyrene food trays (PFT). Samples of FPP and PFT were contaminated with heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 and were incubated at a temperature of 24 1 °C and at controlled relative humidity (RH 65%). The experimental design included analyses at the time 0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 and after every 24 h until the viral RNA was no longer detectable. The results showed a significant decrease (P< 0.001) in viral copy numbers on PFT within 3 h (24% reduction) and, at 72 h, the viral RNA had fallen below the limit of detection. Regarding the FPP, it was necessary to wait 24 h for a significant decrease (P = 0.015) in the viral load (14% reduction), while the detection threshold was reached at 96 h. These findings showed that the viral RNA persists longer on flow pack polyethylene samples than on polystyrene food trays, thus highlighting the importance of material characteristics in the persistence of SARS-CoV-2.

Biofilm formation of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the effect of three sanitisers, peracetic acid, sodium hypochlorite, and chlorhexidine gluconate, on the biofilm production was also studied. The biofilms were formed in milk according to a central composite rotatable design (CCRD) at 0, 1.2, 4, 6.8, and 8 days and 7, 13, 27, 41, and 47 °C. Pseudomonas spp. Counts were observed in milking machine, tank, wall, door handle, floor, drain, and cheese. All Pseudomonas spp. Isolates showed lipolytic activity and some proteolytic activity. P. fluorescens was able to form biofilms at 9.8-47 °C and 0.9-8 days, while P. aeruginosa formed biofilms at 11-47 °C and 0.7-8 days. Complete biofilm removal was not observed for all sanitisers studied, showing difficulty in sanitising the surfaces after the biofilm formation.

Influence of cooking method on the nutritional quality of organic and conventional brazilian vegetables: a study on sodium, potassium, and carotenoids.		Foods					Vegetable consumption is associated with increased health benefits, and vegetables are consumed both in cooked form and raw form in salads. All cooking techniques cause changes in a vegetable's the nutrient content. Consumers are increasingly health-conscious and have less time to prepare meals, and they do not know which cooking times and cooking methods are best suited to preserve the nutrients. This study aimed to determine the best method of cooking vegetables to maintain minerals (potassium and sodium) and carotenoids. The studied vegetables were broccoli (Brassica oleracea, var. Italica), carrots (Daucus carota), and zucchini (Cucurbita moschata). The cooking methods were: boiling, steaming, combined oven, microwave steaming, and microwave cooking. Samples of organic and conventionally grown vegetables were prepared in triplicate. Samples were analyzed to determine the availability of target minerals and carotenoids in the raw food and in each recommended cooking situation according to technical standards. Only the carrot showed a higher concentration in organic cultivation for carotenoids in raw vegetables, with both zucchini and broccoli having higher concentrations when grown by conventional cultivation. The zucchini from organic cultivation presented a reduction of potassium and sodium, almost consistently, in all cooking techniques. Regarding the conventionally cultivated zucchini, potassium remained stable in boiling. Broccoli from organic and conventional cultivation showed similar potassium levels for boiling and traditional steam cooking. Organic carrots showed easier sodium extraction compared with conventional cultivation. Heat treatment, in general, improves the accessibility of carotenoids. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Castro, P. L.; Rincon, L.; Alvarez, B.; Gines, R.							Texture changes during chilled storage of wild and farmed blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) fed different diets.		Food Science & Nutrition					The impact of changes in dietary lipids and protein sources on texture was evaluated on farmed blackspot seabream (Pagellus bogaraveo) throughout 14 days of ice storage and compared with wild fish. A commercial diet formulated with a high proportion of lipids, and two diets formulated with an important reduction of lipid levels by 60% and adding either plant protein sources (LL diet) or fishmeal (LL+ diet) were supplied during growth until commercial size was attained. In the wild fish, the raw fillet hardness was significantly higher than in farmed fish during the entire ice-storage period. In the farmed fish, an increase of muscle lipid accumulation and change of fiber density were responsible for the variations in texture in the raw fillet. The highest reduction was found in fish fed with diets LL+ and LL. The texture parameters studied on the cooked fillets showed no significant differences, neither attributable to the diets nor to the ice-storage period. © 2021 The Authors.

Near infrared spectroscopy coupled to MCR-ALS for the identification and quantification of saffron adulterants: application to complex mixtures.		Food Control					The adulteration of saffron, due to its high market value, is an old and common practice. Hence, there is a high demand for rapid, easy-to-go, environmentally friendly and low-cost techniques able to perform the simultaneous identification and quantification of saffron adulterants. In this sense, the goal of this work was to use near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy coupled to multivariate curve resolution-alternating least-squares (MCR-ALS) for the identification and quantification of four common adulterants (onion, calendula, pomegranate and turmeric). A total of 38 samples containing all these adulterants were prepared. Several spectral regions and pre-processing techniques were tested in the calibration models to find the best combination. The application of MCR-ALS allowed the identification of the adulterants present in the samples through the comparison between the spectral profiles recovered by MCR-ALS and the respective spectra of pure adulterants. Additionally, the quantification of the adulterants was also successfully achieved in these complex samples with relative percentage errors in concentration predictions (RE) of around 10%, except for onion. Overall, the results obtained in this work demonstrate the suitability of NIR spectroscopy coupled to MCR-ALS analysis to identify and quantify adulterants in a very complex mixture and at low levels. To the best of our knowledge, it was the first time that NIR spectroscopy and MCR-ALS were coupled to simultaneously identify and quantify four adulterants in saffron samples.

Extraction and microencapsulation of bioactive compounds from muicle (Justicia spicigera) and their use in the formulation of functional foods.		Foods					Bioactive compounds (BC) present in muicle leaves were extracted using the best extraction conditions obtained with a Box-Behnken experimental design, extracting 95% of BC. Microencapsulation of muicle BC was carried out by spray drying using DE10 maltodextrin (MD) and soy protein isolate (SPI) as encapsulating agents. The best conditions for the ethanolic extraction of BC from muicle were 30 °C, 40% aqueous ethanol, and one extraction for 1 h. The best spray drying encapsulating conditions for BC and antioxidant capacity (AC) using MD as an encapsulating agent were: 160-80 °C and 10% MD in the feeding solution, and for SPI: 180-70 °C and 5% SPI in the feeding solution. Microcapsules were added to yogurt and a sensory evaluation and retention of BC during 15-day storage at 4 °C was performed. Sensory evaluation showed that yogurt with added MD microcapsules had better acceptance than that with SPI microcapsules. Based on this, a jelly with added muicle MD microcapsules was also prepared which obtained better acceptance by the judges. At the end of the storage period, yogurt with SPI microcapsules showed better retention of BC and AC than yogurts with MD microcapsules; however, products with MD microcapsules had better acceptance. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation of the miscibility of novel cocoa butter equivalents by raman mapping and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares.		Foods					Cocoa butter (CB) is an ingredient traditionally used in the manufacturing of chocolates, but its availability is decreasing due to its scarcity and high cost. For this reason, other vegetable oils, known as cocoa butter equivalents (CBE), are used to replace CB partially or wholly. In the present work, two Peruvian vegetable oils, coconut oil (CNO) and sacha inchi oil (SIO), are proposed as novel CBEs. Confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) was used for the chemical differentiation and polymorphism of these oils with CB based on their Raman spectra. To analyze their miscibility, two types of blends were prepared: CB with CNO, and CB with SIO. Both were prepared at 5 different concentrations (5%, 15%, 25%, 35%, and 45%). Raman mapping was used to obtain the chemical maps of the blends and analyze their miscibility through distribution maps, histograms and relative standard deviation (RSD). These values were obtained with multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares. The results show that both vegetable oils are miscible with CB at high concentrations: 45% for CNO and 35% for SIO. At low concentrations, their miscibility decreases. This shows that it is possible to consider these vegetable oils as novel CBEs in the manufacturing of chocolates. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Integration of non-target metabolomics and sensory analysis unravels vegetable plant metabolite signatures associated with sensory quality: a case study using dill (Anethum graveolens).		Food Chemistry					Using dill (Anethum graveolens L.) as a model herb, we reveal novel associations between metabolite profile and sensory quality, by integrating non-target metabolomics with sensory data. Low night temperatures and exposure to UV-enriched light was used to modulate plant metabolism, thereby improving sensory quality. Plant age is a crucial factor associated with accumulation of dill ether and alpha-phellandrene, volatile compounds associated with dill flavour. However, sensory analysis showed that neither of these compounds has any strong association with dill taste. Rather, amino acids alanine, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, valine, and leucine increased in samples exposed to eustress and were positively associated with dill and sour taste. Increases in amino acids and organic acids changed the taste from lemon/grass to a more bitter/pungent dill-related taste. Our procedure reveals a novel approach to establish links between effects of eustressors on sensory quality and may be applicable to a broad range of crops. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Castro-Alves, V. C.; Nascimento, J. R. O. do							Size matters: TLR4-mediated effects of alpha-(1,5)-linear arabino-oligosaccharides in macrophage-like cells depend on their degree of polymerization.		Food Research International					Linear arabino-oligosaccharides (LAOS) produced from controlled enzymatic hydrolysis of arabinans from sugar beet are well-known because of their chain-length dependent prebiotic effects. However, it is not clear if these alpha-(1,5)-linked arabinose oligosaccharides can interact directly with immune system cells, as well as if its degree of polymerization (DP) influences possible biological effects. Four high purity LAOS with distinct DP were tested in macrophage-like cells exposed or not to LPS. Results shown that LAOS interact with Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 in a chain length-dependent manner. LAOS with higher DP induce stimulatory effects mainly through the TLR4/MyD88 pathway, thereby enhancing the release of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL-) 1beta, 6, 12, and chemokines including MCP-1, RANTES, IL-8, and IP-10. Notably, LAOS with lower DP appears to have an opposite effect to those counterparts with higher DP, as they does not induce the secretion of cytokines and chemokines in macrophages-like cells, while also inhibit TLR4-mediated effects induced by both lipopolysaccharide and LAOS with higher DP. These findings provide not only insights into potential biological effects of LAOS, but also reveal that controlled enzymatic hydrolysis of sugar beet arabinans may lead to dietary oligosaccharides with desired biological properties.

Impact of the popping process on the structural and thermal properties of sorghum grains (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench).		Food Chemistry					The popping process has been widely used as a technique for obtaining snacks. This study evaluated the effect of the popping process on the structural and thermal properties of sorghum. Seven varieties of sorghum were used. Raw sorghum grains were adjusted to 11% moisture and popped at 210 °C for 90 s with hot air. Microstructure, thermal and viscosity properties, and X-Ray and infrared spectrum were measured in raw and popped sorghum. The popping process produced an ordered honeycomb-like structure in the sorghum. The viscosity profile showed an increase in the thermal stability of popped sorghum. DSC measurements showed a starch gelatinization and a second transition about to 145 °C. XRD diffractograms display a reduction in the amplitude of the crystalline orthorhombic structure peaks. Finally, infrared indicated a change in the short-range structure and protein denaturation due to the popping process. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Spray-drying encapsulation of microwave-assisted extracted polyphenols from Moringa oleifera: influence of tragacanth, locust bean, and carboxymethyl-cellulose formulations.		Food Research International					In this work, polyphenols from Moringa oleifera (Mor) leaves were extracted by microwave-assisted extraction (MAE) and encapsulated by spray-drying (SD). Particularly, we explored the influence of tragacanth gum (TG), locust bean gum (LBG), and carboxymethyl-cellulose (CMC) as wall-materials on the physicochemical behavior of encapsulated Mor. Single or combined wall-material treatments (100:00 and 50:50 ratios, and total solid content 1%) were tested. The results showed the wall-material had a significant effect on the process yield (55.7-68.3%), encapsulation efficiency (24.28-35.74%), color (yellow or pale-yellow), total phenolic content (25.17-27.49 mg GAE g-1 of particles), total flavonoid content (23.20-26.87 mg QE g-1 of particles), antioxidant activity (DPPH. = 5.96-6.95 mg GAE g-1; ABTS.+ = 5.61-6.18 mg TE g-1 of particles), and particle size distribution (D50 = 112-1946 nm) of the encapsulated Mor. On the other hand, SEM analysis showed smooth and spherical particles, while TGA and DSC analyses confirmed the encapsulation of bioactive compounds based on the changes in thermal peaks. Finally, XRD analysis showed that the particles have an amorphous behavior. The encapsulated Mor produced with individual TG or CMC demonstrated better properties than those obtained from mixed gums. Thus, TG or CMC might be feasible wall materials for manufacturing encapsulated Mor that conserve the phenolic content and antioxidant activity. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Physicochemical treatments for the reduction of aflatoxins and Aspergillus niger in corn grains (Zea mays).		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Corn grains are commonly contaminated with mycotoxins and fungi. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the reduction of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2 and the inhibition of Aspergillus niger in corn grains using ultrasound, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, electrolyzed water, and sodium bicarbonate. The determination of aflatoxins was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection and postcolumn derivatization, and analysis of A. niger was performed by evaluating mycelial growth in potato dextrose agar. The best treatment for reducing aflatoxins and inhibiting mycelial growth was evaluated in corn contaminated with A. niger. Results. The results show a significant reduction in aflatoxins in the following order: sodium bicarbonate>ultrasound>UV>electrolyzed water for aflatoxins B1, B2, and G2. For aflatoxin G1, the order of reduction was sodium bicarbonate>ultrasound>electrolyzed water>UV, with maximum values between 70.50% and 87.03% reached with sodium bicarbonate; for the other treatments, the reduction was between 51.51% and 65.44%. Regarding the fungus, the order of inhibition in the control of mycelial growth was sodium bicarbonate>ultrasound>electrolyzed water>UV in corn grains, and inhibition of mycelial growth was obtained at a sodium bicarbonate concentration of 3.0 gL-1. Conclusion. Sodium bicarbonate, electrolyzed water, ultrasound, and UV radiation inhibited the growth of A. niger on potato dextrose agar and reduced the contents of aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, and G2in vitro. Sodium bicarbonate showed an ability to inhibit mycelial growth in corn grains. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Characterisation, storage viabilit, and application of microspheres with Lactobacillus paracasei obtained by the extrusion technique.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of pH, bile salts and different storage conditions at two different temperatures (30 and 4 °C) on the viability of free and microencapsulated Lactobacillus paracasei. Microspheres encapsulating L. paracasei were obtained using an extrusion method. The efficiency was 87.6%, the diameter 70 m and the zeta potential 7.22 0.05 mV. Encapsulated L. paracasei showed higher resistance to stomach pH and bile salts compared to free cells. Microspheres were evaluated under four different storage conditions: fresh, suspended in a solution with a pH of 4, suspended in saline solution and lyophilised. The lyophilised microspheres presented the highest stability with 89.2% survival rate after six weeks of storage; however, free bacteria in saline solution (0.145 N) presented a 65.3% survival rate. Finally, a new product (a strawberry ice popsicle) with possible functional characteristics was obtained using microencapsulated L. paracasei. © 2020 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Tomato is one of the widely cultivated crops worldwide that is affected by several pests, such as fungi (Fusarium oxysoporum, Alternaria solani), bacteria (Pectobacterium carotovorum) and weeds (Cyperus iria L., Amaranthus spinosus). A growing interest has emerged for developing plant-derived pesticidal compounds to counteract these pests. One attractive alternative is to use barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli), known to be widely resistant to synthetic herbicides, as a potential biopesticide compound source. Results. Phytochemical screening of the crude extract showed that phenolic compounds were the most abundant component present in barnyard grass. The crude extract was evaluated for antifungal, antibacterial and herbicidal activities. Bioassays showed inhibition against F. oxysporum (10.731.30%) and A. solani (20.473.51%), the causative agent of Fusariumrot and early blight disease in tomato, respectively. Antibacterial activity against P. carotovorum gave a mean zone of inhibition (paper disc diffusion assay) of 17.001.00mm and an IC50 (dose-response assay) of 2.26mgmL-1 was observed. Dose-responsive herbicidal activity on the lettuce seed germination bioassay produced an IC50 of 459.30ppm. Selectivity studies showed inhibition towards C. iria and A. spinosus with no effect on tomato. Lastly, bioassay-guided fractionation coupled with untargeted metabolomics studies using ultra-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection-tandem mass spectrometry mass analyses revealed loliolide and tricin as the putative metabolites present in barnyard grass. Conclusion. To date, this is the first reported study on using barnyard grass as a potential alternative biopesticide against tomato pests such as fungi, bacteria and weeds. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Food Research International					Dry roasting can reduce Salmonella contamination on peanuts. While previous studies evaluated impact of product temperature, process humidity, product moisture, and/or product water activity on Salmonella lethality, no published study has tested multiple primary and secondary models on data collected in a real-world processing environment. We tested multiple primary and secondary models to quantify Salmonella surrogate, Enterococcus faecium, inactivation on peanuts. Shelled runner-type peanuts inoculated with E. faecium were treated at various air temperatures (121, 149, and 177 °C) and air velocities (1.0 and 1.3 m/s) for treatment times from 1 to 63 min. Peanut surface temperature was measured during treatment. Water activity and moisture content were measured, and E. faecium were enumerated after treatment. Microbial inactivation was modeled as a function of time, product temperature, and product moisture. Parameters (Dref, zT, zaw, zMC, and/or n) were compared between model fits. The log-linear primary model combined with either the modified Bigelow-type secondary model accounting for aw or moisture content showed improved fit over the log-linear primary model combined with the traditional Bigelow-type secondary model. The Weibull primary model combined with the traditional Bigelow-type secondary model had the best fit. All parameter relative errors were less than 15%, and RMSE values ranged from 0.379 to 0.674 log CFU/g. Incorporating either aw or moisture content in the inactivation models did not make a practical difference within the range of conditions and model forms evaluated, and air velocity did not have a significant impact on inactivation. The models developed can aid processors in developing and validating pathogen reduction during peanut roasting.

Impact of micro-oxygenation timing and rate of addition on color stabilization and chromatic characteristics of cabernet sauvignon wines.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The presented study evaluated anthocyanins, anthocyanin-derived pigments and chromatic characteristics of six micro-oxygenation treatments resulting from applying oxygen at different times and rates. Oxygen was applied before malolactic fermentation (MLF) at a rate of zero or 20 mg O2/L/month and after MLF at rates of zero, 4.5 or 9 mg O2/L/month. LC-MS analysis after 6 months of bottle aging indicated that the formation of anthocyanin-derived compounds was related to the acetaldehyde (ACH) levels. When observing an increase in the level of ACH, formation of compounds was enhanced in which ACH was involved as B-type vitisins. Otherwise, where ACH was not involved, compounds as A-type vitisins, pinotins and direct adducts, were formed. Although the wine was filtered after MLF, only a marginal increase in the ACH concentration was observed during post-MLF MOX. This increase occurred only in wines that had previously received pre-MLF MOX. When MOX was applied at both moments and highest rates, wines produced a higher yellow color component (b*) and hue (hab) than the rest of the wines. These CIELab parameters were highly correlated with flavanyl-pyranoanthocyanins. These results suggest that in order to stabilize wine color, it is recommended to apply MOX before and after MLF.

Characterization of vegetative Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis strains isolated from processed cheese products in an Italian dairy plant.		Foods					Processed cheese is a commercial product characterized by high microbiological stability and extended shelf life obtained through the application of severe heat treatment. However, spore-forming bacteria can survive through thermal processes. Among them, microorganisms belonging to Bacillus genus have been reported. In this study, we examined the microbiological population of the first hours' production of processed cheeses in an Italian dairy plant during two seasons, between June and October 2020. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to identify bacteria colonies, allowing the isolation of Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis strains. These results were further confirmed by amplification and sequencing of 16 rRNA bacterial region. A multi-locus sequence type (MLST) analysis was performed to assess the genetic similarity among a selection of isolates. The fourteen B. cereus strains showed two sequence types: ST-32 was observed in only one strain and the ST-371 in the remaining thirteen isolates. On the contrary, all twenty-one B. subtlis strains, included in the study, showed a new allelic profile for the pycA gene, resulting in a new sequence type: ST-249. For B. cereus strains, analysis of toxin genes was performed. All isolates were positive for nheABC, entFM, and cytK, while hblABCD, bceT, and ces were not detected. Moreover, the biofilm-forming ability of B. cereus and B. subtilis strains was assessed, and all selected isolates proved to be biofilm formers (most of them were stronger producers). Considering the genetical similarity between isolates, jointly with the capacity to produce biofilm, the presence of a recurring Bacillus population could be hypothesized. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					According to the WHO, cancer was responsible for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018, making it the second global leading cause of death. The main risk factors that lead to the development of this disease include poor behavioral and dietary habits, such as tobacco use, alcohol use and lack of fruit and vegetable intake, or physical inactivity. In turn, it is well known that polyphenols are deeply implicated with the lower rates of cancer in populations that consume high levels of plant derived foods. In this field, phlorotannins have been under the spotlight in recent years since they have shown exceptional bioactive properties, with great interest for application in food and pharmaceutical industries. Among their multiple bioactive properties, phlorotannins have revealed the capacity to interfere with several biochemical mechanisms that regulate oxidative stress, inflammation and tumorigenesis, which are central aspects in the pathogenesis of cancer. This versatility and ability to act either directly or indirectly at different stages and mechanisms of cancer growth make these compounds highly appealing for the development of new therapeutical strategies to address this world scourge. The present manuscript revises relevant studies focusing the effects of phlorotannins to counteract the oxidative stress-inflammation network, emphasizing their potential for application in cancer prevention and/or treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

Meat Science					The amount and quality of covering adipose tissue affect the suitability of hind legs for the production of high-quality seasoned hams. To date, no studies exist on the correlation between EUROP carcass classification and backfat fatty acid (FA) composition in heavy pigs used for dry-cured hams. A sample of 898 Italian Large White heavy pigs was used to verify the relationship between carcass classification based on lean meat percentage and backfat FA composition. A Canonical Discriminant Analysis (CDA) was used to verify the power of individual FA and FA categories in discriminating among EUROP classes. The results proved that saturated FAs (i.e. palmitic, stearic and arachidic acids) and the n-6 polyunsaturated FAs have the highest discriminating power, thus permitting to differentiate among E, U, R, O carcass classes. For the first time, this work demonstrates the relationship between EUROP pig carcass grading, which is only based on an estimate of the percentage of lean meat, and backfat FA composition.

J		Cattaneo, A.; Federighi, G.; Vaz, S.							The environmental impact of reducing food loss and waste: a critical assessment.		Food Policy					This paper examines the rationale for pursuing environmental objectives by reducing food loss and waste (FLW). The main thrust of the literature on this issue is that FLW reduction can make a major contribution to making food systems more sustainable. Using a stylized analytical framework, we find that reducing FLW always improves resource use efficiency for land and water, and reduces the amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) emitted per unit of food consumed. However, whether the actual environmental outcome is improved will depend on where environmental damage and FLW reduction occur, and the way price transmission connects these along the food supply chain. We find that, while a food waste reduction at the consumer level always improves the environmental outcome, this is not guaranteed when reducing losses from farm to retail. We thus derive a condition linking the price transmission mechanism and the environmental impact of a loss reduction. Simulating environmental outcomes based on a range of parameter values found in the literature, we find that reducing losses at or close to the farm level can increase the aggregate amount of GHG emissions, and therefore focusing on reducing consumer waste is more effective in reducing emissions. As for reducing natural resource use, both loss and waste reductions reduce the amount of land and water use, but effectiveness is reduced by heterogeneity in environmental impact. Relative to loss reductions, effectiveness of a waste reduction is amplified if there are environmentally damaging losses upstream in the value chain, but also dampened by vertical heterogeneity of sourcing along a value chain. The paper makes the case that more targeted instruments may be better suited to address typically local water scarcity and land use and degradation issues.

Food Policy					Despite broad agreement in policy circles on the need to reduce food loss and waste (FLW), considerable gaps in information still exist. This paper identifies policy-relevant information gaps, summarizes recent research that tries to fill these gaps and identifies five challenges for researchers, policymakers and practitioners in reducing FLW. The five challenges identified are: (i) measuring and monitoring FLW, (ii) assessing benefits and costs of FLW reduction and the tradeoffs involved, (iii) designing FLW-related policies and interventions under limited information, (iv) understanding how interactions between stages along food value chain and across countries affect outcomes of FLW reduction efforts, (v) preparing for income transitions and the shifting relative importance of losses and waste as economies develop.

Among the physiological changes, the severity of the inflammatory response can vary after the dry-off, and this response might have consequences on cow adaptation in the transition period. The plasma protein profile is a diagnostic tool widely used in humans and animals to assess the inflammatory status and predict the outcome of severe diseases. The albumin-to-globulin ratio (AG) can represent a simple and useful proxy for the inflammatory condition. In this study, we investigated the relationship between AG before dry-off and inflammation, metabolic profile, and performance of 75 Holstein dairy cows. Blood samples were collected from-62 (7 d before dry-off) to 28 d relative to calving (DFC) to measure metabolic profile biomarkers, inflammatory variables, and liver function. Daily milk yield in the first month of lactation was recorded. Milk composition, body condition score, fertility, and health status were also assessed. The AG calculated 1 wk before dry-off (-62 DFC) was used to retrospectively group cows into tertiles (1.06 0.09 for HI, 0.88 0.04 for IN, and 0.72 0.08 for LO). Data were subjected to ANOVA using the PROC MIXED program in SAS software. Differences among groups observed at-62 DFC were almost maintained throughout the period of interest, but AG peaked before calving. According to the level of acute-phase proteins (haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, albumin, cholesterol, retinol-binding protein), bilirubin, and paraoxonase, a generally overall lower inflammatory condition was found in HI and IN than in the LO group immediately after the dry-off but also after calving. The HI cows had greater milk yield than LO cows, but no differences were observed in milk composition. The somatic cell count reflected the AG ratio trend, with higher values in LO than IN and HI either before dry-off or after calving. Fertility was better in HI cows, with fewer days open and services per pregnancy than IN and LO cows. Overall, cows with high AG before dry-off showed an improved adaptation to the new lactation, as demonstrated by a reduced systemic inflammatory response and increased milk yield than cows with low AG. In conclusion, the AG ratio before dry-off might represent a rapid and useful proxy to evaluate the innate immune status and likely the ability to adapt while switching from the late lactation to the nonlactating phase and during the transition period with emphasis on early lactation.

J		Cattivelli, A.; Conte, A.; Martini, S.; Tagliazucchi, D.							Influence of cooking methods on onion phenolic compounds bioaccessibility.		Foods					The impact of domestic cooking (baking, boiling, frying and grilling) and in vitro digestion on the stability and release of phenolic compounds from yellow-skinned (YSO) and red-skinned onions (RSO) have been evaluated. The mass spectrometry identification pointed out flavonols as the most representative phenolic class, led by quercetin-derivatives. RSO contained almost the double amount of phenolic compounds respect to YSO (50.12 and 27.42 mg/100 g, respectively). Baking, grilling and primarily frying resulted in an increased amount of total phenolic compounds, especially quercetin-derivatives, in both the onion varieties. Some treatments promoted the degradation of quercetin-3-O-hexoside-4′-O-hexoside, the main compound present in both the onion varieties, leading to the occurrence of quercetin-4′-O-hexoside and protocatechuic acid-4-O-hexoside. After in vitro digestion, the bioaccessibility index for total phenolic compounds ranged between 42.6% and 65.5% in grilled and baked YSO, respectively, and between 39.8% and 80.2% in boiled and baked RSO, respectively. Baking contributed to the highest amount of bioaccessible phenolic compounds for both the onion varieties after in vitro digestion. An in-depth design of the cooking process may be of paramount importance in modulating the gastro-intestinal release of onion phenolic compounds. © 2021 by the authors.

Detection of celery (Apium graveolens) allergen in foods of animal and plant origin by droplet digital PCR assay.		Food Control					Celery is included among the allergenic foods that, under the EU 1169/2011 regulation, must be declared in the ingredient list. However, disposition covers only allergens that are voluntary used as ingredients and not the accidental presence of allergens in a food as consequence of cross contamination. To guarantee compliance with food allergen regulations and protect health of food-allergic consumers are needed specific and sensitive methods to detect the presence of allergens in foods. Detection of allergens relies of protein- and DNA-based methods. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) targeting sequences from the mannitol dehydrogenase (Mtd) gene is currently the method of choice for detection and quantification of celery in foods. However, quantification by RT-PCR methods needs standard calibration curves of the target DNA. To overcome this limitation in the present study the use of a droplet digital PCR (dd-PCR) assay has been proposed for the quantification of celery in foods. A preliminarily optimization of the dd-PCR protocol was conducted using serial DNA dilution extracted from celery powder. Ideal primer probe concentrations were 0.9 muM of both forward and reverse primers and 0.250 muM of probe. The optimal annealing temperature was at 60°C. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.20 0.12 Cp/muL while the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 0.83 0.20 Cp/muL. The dd-PCR assay showed no cross-reactivity with other vegetal species, indicating a good specificity. No effect of food matrix was observed on the dd-PCR performance. The method was able to quantify the presence of celery in commercial foods of animal and plant origin. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Characteristics of pork muscles cooked to varying end-point temperatures.		Foods					M. Biceps femoris (BF), m. Semimembranosus (SM) and m. Semitendinosus (ST) from fresh pork ham were evaluated for characteristics of quality after cooking to an internal endpoint temperature of 62°C or 73°C. Fresh ham muscles from the left side (N = 68) were cut into 2.54cm thick chops and allocated to cooking loss, Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), pH and instrumental cooked color analysis. Cooking losses were greater (p < 0.0001) for SM and chops cooked to an internal temperature of 73°C (p < 0.0001), whereas WBSF did not differ (p = 0.2509) among the three muscles, but was greater (p < 0.0001) in chops cooked to 73°C. Fresh muscle's pH was greater (p < 0.05) in ST than BF or SM. Lastly, the interactive effect (p < 0.05) of muscle * endpoint temperature for ST chops cooked to 73°C was lighter (L*), but, when cooked to 62°C, they were more red (a*), more yellow (b*) and incurred less color change from red to brown than BF or SM. The current results suggest it is plausible for BF, SM and ST to be considered for alternative uses instead of traditional value-added manufacturing. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Policy					Food security is identified as one of the main challenges for the 21st century. In the Pacific islands this is especially the case due to natural, topographical, social, environmental, and economic constraints and the influence of globalisation that has forced many populations to resort to imported food. While hunger is rarely experienced by households, poor nutrition leads to a considerable noncommunicable disease burden. The effects of climate change will further exacerbate food security challenges in the region. Kiribati has one of the highest prevalence rates for obesity, diabetes and hypertension anywhere in the world. While past studies have explored regional and state-level food security challenges, there is comparatively little literature on household-level decision making processes related to food. Through focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews, we identified several themes describing challenges to achieving food security in the island nation, including several environmental challenges that hinder food security. We also include some policy recommendations based on these findings. These challenges and policy recommendations may be applicable to other atoll island communities in the Pacific and other remote coastal communities worldwide.

Onofrio, N. d'						Amino acids, betaines and related ammonium compounds in Neapolitan limmo, a Mediterranean sweet lime, also known as lemoncetta Locrese.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The so-called "Neapolitan limmo" or "lemoncetta Locrese" is an old and now rare Mediterranean sweet lime, similar to lemon but smaller. It is a fruit distinguished from orange, lemon, mandarin, and lime for its sweeter, watery, and non-acidic taste, with a pH between 5.6 and 5.9. No compositional studies are currently available for this citrus fruit. Here we report, for the first time, the distribution in the limmo juice of free amino acids and their main derivatives such as betaines and related ammonium compounds. Results. Seven proteinogenic amino acids (proline, asparagine, serine, aspartic acid, glutamine, alanine, and threonine) and a non-protein amino acid (gamma-aminobutyric acid) characterize Neapolitan limmo juice. Proline betaine is the predominant betaine. The data were compared with those of other important citrus juices. Conclusion. The specific "taste quality" of Neapolitan limmo juice can be attributed to its peculiar composition in amino acids. The species-specific presence of the ammonium compound derivatives of the amino acid proline, with proline betaine as the predominant betaine, characterize the non-acidic varieties of Mediterranean sweet lime. Our study constitutes an important step towards the repopulation of this ancient plant and its exploitation in food industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Cava, R.; Higuero, N.; Ladero, L.							High-pressure processing and storage temperature on Listeria monocytogenes, microbial counts and oxidative changes of two traditional dry-cured meat products.		Meat Science					The effects of high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing (600 MPa, 8 min, 16 °C) and storage temperature (4 °C and 18 °C) on experimentally inoculated Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes), mesophilic aerobic plate counts (APC) and yeast and mould (YM) populations in Iberian dry-cured "salchichon" (DCS) and dry-cured loin (DCL) during 120 days of storage were studied. Tocopherol contents, fatty acid profile, instrumental colour and lipid and protein oxidation were evaluated. HHP treatment reduced L. monocytogenes population by >3 log10 in both DCS and DCL. HHP and storage temperature affected APC differently in both products, whereas YM were significantly decreased by HHP, mostly at 18 °C. Lipid and protein oxidation were promoted, mainly in DCS, and the colour was affected in a minor extent. Despite these effects on oxidation, these results suggest that HHP treatment at 600 MPa for 8 min in both products allowed to control L. monocytogenes below the microbiological limit established by the food safety regulations.

Synergistic antimicrobial activities of combinations of vanillin and essential oils of cinnamon bark, cinnamon leaves, and cloves.		Foods					Plant bioactive compounds have antimicrobial and antioxidant activities that allow them to be used as a substitute for synthetic chemical additives in both food and food packaging. To improve its sensory and bactericidal effects, its use in the form of effective combinations has emerged as an interesting possibility in the food industry. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of essential oils (EOs) of cinnamon bark, cinnamon leaves, and clove and the pure compounds vanillin, eugenol, and cinnamaldehyde were investigated individually and in combination against Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli O157:H7. The possible interactions of combinations of pure compounds and EOs were performed by the two-dimensional checkerboard assay and isobologram methods. Vanillin exhibited the lowest antimicrobial activity (MIC of 3002 ppm against L. monocytogenes and 2795 ppm against E. coli O157:H7), while clove and cinnamon bark EOs exhibited the highest antimicrobial activity (402-404 against L. monocytogenes and 778-721 against E. coli O157:H7). For L. monocytogenes, pure compound eugenol, the main component of cinnamon leaves and clove, showed lower antimicrobial activity than EOs, which was attributed to the influence of the minor components of the EOs. The same was observed with cinnamaldehyde, the main component of cinnamon bark EO. The combinations of vanillin/clove EO and vanillin/cinnamon bark EO showed the most synergistic antimicrobial effect. The combination of the EOs of cinnamon bark/clove and cinnamon bark/cinnamon leaves showed additive effect against L. monocytogenes but indifferent effect against E. coli O157:H7. For L. monocytogenes, the best inhibitory effects were achieved by cinnamon bark EO (85 ppm)/vanillin (910 ppm) and clove EO (121 ppm)/vanillin (691 ppm) combinations. For E. coli, the inhibitory effects of clove EO (104 ppm)/vanillin (1006 ppm) and cinnamon leaves EO (118 ppm)/vanillin (979 ppm) combinations were noteworthy. Some of the tested combinations increased the antimicrobial effect and would allow the effective doses to be reduced, thereby offering possible new applications for food and active food packaging. © 2021 by the authors.

Spatiotemporal modelling of the quality and ripening of two cultivars of "Algarve Citrus" orchards at different edaphoclimatic conditions.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					"Algarve Citrus" are non-climacteric Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) commodities. They are harvested with minimal levels of juice content (≥35%), soluble solids content (SSC) (≥10%) and maturation index (MI) (≥8), as required by the respective PGI normative reference. These internal quality attributes (IQA) are usually determined in small samples of fruit collected from the orchards close to harvest. This study aimed to use geostatistics to help predict the optimal harvest date (OHD) of two sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) cultivars, namely, "Newhall", and "Valencia Late", at two different edaphoclimatic conditions observed in the locations of Quarteira, at the coast, and Paderne, near a mountainous area. Two orchards of 0.5-0.7 ha per cultivar were chosen and a total of 25 trees were georeferenced within each orchard, comprising 100 sampling points/trees. Firmness, juice content, SSC and MI of fruit were determined through time. In general, the fruit grown in Quarteira showed higher SSC and MI and lower firmness values, ripening two months earlier than those grown in Paderne, although the full effect of the various edaphoclimatic factors on these results are not fully understood. However, geospatial modelling of ripening has shown a large variability within the orchards, with some IQA evolution patterns observed in some orchards and/or cultivars but not in the others. Specifically, 1) a negative correlation between the firmness and MI spatial patterns; 2) a variable decay rate of firmness, much faster in Paderne for 'Valencia Late'; 3) local minima in juice content, below 35%, observed in restricted spatial areas and in specific time periods, and which were clearer in "Newhall". These local variations highlight the need for an optimized management based on geospatial modelling. For example, the variable decay rate of firmness must be taken into account during fruit harvest and postharvest handling. On the other side, the observation of localized plots with juice content below 35% must be contextualized in the broader picture of the entire orchard which, in the present study, always had consistent temporal average level above 35%. This study has provided evidence that fruit ripening variability should be considered in the site-specific orchard management of citrus to optimize their harvest date. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Seasonal nutritional profile of Gelidium corneum (Rhodophyta, Gelidiaceae) from the center of Portugal.		Foods					Gelidium corneum is a well-known agarophyte, harvested worldwide for its high agar quality. However, the species also exhibits an interesting nutritional profile, but with seasonal variations. Therefore, to evaluate the nutritional value of G. corneum, ash, crude protein, total lipids, and carbohydrates were analyzed at different times of the year. The heavy metals mercury, arsenic, lead, cadmium, and tin, as well as iodine were also measured. Finally, the seasonal antioxidant capacity of G. corneum extracts was evaluated. Our results indicate that the biomass is rich in protein (up to 16.25 0.33%) and carbohydrates (up to 39.5 3.29%), and low in lipids (up to 2.75 0.28%), and especially in the summer, the AI, TI indexes, n-6/n-3 and h/H ratios (0.93, 0.6, 0.88 and 1.08, respectively) are very interesting. None of the contaminants exceeded the legally established limits, and the iodine values were adequate for a healthy diet. Finally, the antioxidant capacity is fair, with the DPPH ≤ 10.89 1.46%, and ABTS ≤ 13.90 1.54% inhibition, FRAP ≤ 0.91 0.22 AAE.g-1, and TPC ≤ 6.82 0.26 GAE.g-1. The results show that G. corneum is an attractive resource, with potential use as food or as a food supplement. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Inactivation of polyphenol oxidase by microwave and conventional heating: investigation of thermal and non-thermal effects of focused microwaves.		Food Chemistry					Emerging technologies, such as focused microwave heating of liquid foods, have been studied to reduce quality losses due to the high temperatures of conventional processing. Besides faster heating, microwaves can also have non-thermal effects on inactivation; however, this is a controversial issue. The objective of this study was to compare conventional and focused microwave heating under similar conditions for the inactivation of two polyphenol oxidases (PPOs): mushroom tyrosinase in buffer and the PPO present in coconut water. Small samples under stirring were treated at temperatures between 50 and 90 °C and three kinetic models were adjusted considering the whole time-temperature history. The Weibull model could best describe inactivation in both heating processes, which was more effective with microwave heating for temperatures over 70 °C. Validation runs show that the model can satisfactorily describe the PPO inactivation. This study contributes for the design of liquid food pasteurization by focused microwave technology.

Donkey milk and fermented donkey milk: are there differences in the nutritional value and physicochemical characteristics?		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to evaluate the nutritional value and physicochemical characteristics of fresh donkey milk and fermented donkey milk. Furthermore, the impact of the refrigerated storage (4 °C, 21 days) on the characteristics of the fermented milk was evaluated. The fermented milk had higher acidity (lower pH values and higher titratable acidity) and presented lower lactose, mineral (calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, sodium, and zinc), and amino acid (mainly essential amino acids) contents than milk. Otherwise, it had a better fatty acid profile (lower saturated fatty acid content, and higher monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acid contents). The fermented milk storage resulted in decreases in the lactose content, improvements in the amino acid profile, and maintenance of the mineral content. However, negative impacts were observed on the fatty acid profile. It can be concluded that both donkey milk and fermented milk donkey present important nutritional value, and the fermented milk could be refrigerated stored up to 21 days.

Both formulations presented acceptable weight losses during ripening. In both the CFC and CALG treatments, pH values were lower (P< 0.05) at the end of the ripening and storage stages. Dry-fermented sausages with the incorporation of probiotics via alginate beads had higher (P< 0.05) protein and fat, but lower (P< 0.05) moisture content. The addition of E. faecium CECT 410 did not affect lipid oxidation in dry-fermented sausages. Counts of E. faecium CECT 410 were higher than 7 log CFU g-1 during the ripening and storage periods, except in the control (CC), in which it was not detected as a natural microbiota. Altogether, the addition of E. faecium CECT 410, both as free cells (CFC) and in alginate beads (CALG), was effective at producing probiotic dry-fermented sausages. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Chia oil effect was tested using paw edema and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by carrageenan, and ear edema induced by croton oil, histamine, and capsaicin. Croton oil was used in both preventive and therapeutic treatment schedules of chia oil while histamine and capsaicin were used only in preventive treatment schedule. Chia oil mechanism of action was investigated using nociception and paw edema response induced by intraplantar injection of acidified saline (ASIC activator), PGE2 (prostaglandin pathway), cinnamaldehyde (TRPA1 activator), bradykinin (BK pathway), menthol (TRPM8 activator), and capsaicin (TRPV1 activator). Further, RT-PCR for inflammatory mediators (TRPA1, NF-kappaB, PPAR-gamma, COX-2, IL-6, TNF, FPR2, FAAH, MAGL, and IL-12A) induced by carrageenan, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the cell viability were then accessed. Later, chia oil actions were evaluated in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a multiple sclerosis (MS) model. Chia oil showed anti-edematogenic and anti-hyperalgesic effects when administered 1 h before pro-inflammatory stimulus-particularly carrageenan and croton oil. Moreover, chia oil upregulated the mRNA levels of COX-2 and formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) while reduced IL-6 expression in the spinal cord of mice submitted to i. Pl. Injection of carrageenan. Interestingly, chia oil mediates antinociceptive effects in mice decreasing the nociceptive response induced by acidified saline, PGE2, and cinnamaldehyde, but not by bradykinin, menthol, and capsaicin. On the EAE model, chia oil preventively administered attenuated EAE-induced motor deficits and mechanical hyperalgesia in mice, suggesting a valuable effect of chia oil supplementation in regulating inflammatory responses and some immune functions during immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMID). Nonetheless, additional reports will need to assess the effect of chia oil in well-controlled clinical trials performed in MS patients. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Cavazza, A.; Bignardi, C.; Grimaldi, M.; Salvadeo, P.; Corradini, C.							Oligomers: hidden sources of bisphenol A from reusable food contact materials.		Food Research International					A recent European Regulation further restricted the use of bisphenol A in food-contact materials, reducing its limit of migration. However, all analytical systems of control are aimed at identifying and quantifying the molecules of this monomer without taking in consideration the possible presence of its oligomers, species originating from material degradation and able to follow an in-vivo hydrolysis providing bisphenol A generation. Thus, the presence of oligomers of polycarbonate deriving by unreacted species or polymer degradation can be considered a hidden source of several bisphenol A units, that remains outside the control of legislation and should be considered of high concern. This work was focused on the identification and the description of kinetics of release of different molecules migrating from polycarbonate food contact materials to simulants and to a model food sample such as melted chocolate. Analyses were performed by UHPLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive mass spectrometer. Targeted and untargeted analysis through data dependent acquisition mode allowed to detect the occurrence of several species deriving from polycarbonate, and permitted to investigate the polymer degradation pattern and explore the correlation of the recorded amounts of each product with age, hours of usage, and washing cycles of the plastic items.

Normal-phase chromatographic separation of pigmented wine tannin by nano-HPLC quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and identification of candidate molecular features.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. As a wine ages, altered sensory properties lead to changes in perceived quality and value. Concurrent modifications of anthocyanin and tannin occur forming pigmented tannin, softening astringency and retaining persistent color. Wine tannin extracts of 1990 and 2010 vintages of Oakville Station Cabernet Sauvignon have been analyzed using normal-phase chromatography with tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (QToF) to investigate the compositional differences in their pigmented tannin fractions. Results. The older wine demonstrates much greater structural diversity and a range of more polar compounds, while the younger wine contains fewer observed ion peaks. Several hundred molecular features are observable, and, as expected, there is progression to higher molecular weights after long aging. Between 7% and 16% of molecular features could be matched to a database of anticipated pigmented tannin compounds. Many signals had multiple possible isomeric identities, but fragmentation to resolve their identity was stymied by low sensitivity of the tandem mass spectrometric capability provided by QToF, so isomeric disambiguation is incomplete. Conclusions. The chromatography displayed a high degree of resolution in aged wines, separating many of the known pigment types, including aldehyde bridged compounds, pyranoanthocyanins and direct condensation products among others, as well as resolving a great number of unknown compounds. Expanding our understanding of red wine pigments will lead to better wines as winemakers will be able to associate quality with particular wine pigment profiles once we can distinguish the relevant patterns in those pigments. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Improving the survival of Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B-1927 during microencapsulation with ultra-high-pressure-homogenized soymilk as a wall material.		Food Research International					Probiotic foods and supplements have been shown to offer multiple potential health benefits to consumers. Dried probiotic cultures are increasingly used by the food industry because they are easily handled, transported, stored, and used in different applications. However, drying technologies often expose probiotic cells to extreme environmental conditions that reduces cell viability. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the effect of using ultra high-pressure homogenization (UHPH) on soymilk's microencapsulating ability, and the resultant effect on the survivability of probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum NRRL B-1927 (LP) during drying. Liquid suspensions containing LP (~109 CFU/g of solids) were prepared by suspending LP cultures in soymilk which had been either treated with UHPH at 150 MPa or 300 MPa or left untreated. LP suspensions were then dried by concurrent spray drying (CCSD), mixed-flow spray drying (MXSD) or freeze-drying (FD). Cell counts of LP were determined before and after microencapsulation. Moisture, water activity, particle size and morphology of LP powders were also characterized. LP powders produced with 300 MPa treated soymilk had 8.7,6.4, and 2 times more cell counts than those produced with non-UHPH treated soymilk during CCSD, MXSD, and FD, respectively. In the 300 MPa treated samples, cell survival (%) of LP during drying was the highest in MXSD (83.72) followed by FD (76.31) and CCSD (34.01). Using soymilk treated at higher UHPH pressures resulted in LP powders with lower moisture content, smaller particle sizes and higher agglomeration. LP powders produced via MXSD showed higher agglomeration and fewer signs of thermal damage than powders produced via CCSD. This study demonstrates that UHPH improves the effectiveness of soymilk as a microencapsulant for probiotics, creating probiotic powders that could be used in plant-based and non-dairy foods.

J		Cavina, M.; Battino, M.; Gaddi, A. V.; Savo, M. T.; Visioli, F.							Supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid and inflammation: a feasibility trial.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					Consumption of omega-3 fatty acids, including the precursor alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is often sub-optimal and not in line with international guidelines. Supplementation is debatable, but some individuals, e.g., pre-diabetic, low-grade inflammation, cardiometabolic yet otherwise healthy subjects, might benefit from supra-physiological omega-3 intake, particularly to lessen inflammation. We explored the feasibility of a large clinical trial by performing a pilot study to evaluate adherence, palatability, and self-reported side effects of ALA administration in a group of volunteers. We enrolled 12 individuals with borderline dyslipidemia or overweight, treated with dietary advice according to international guidelines and who had insufficient intakes of essential fatty acids. Subjects were followed for nutritional counselling and were matched with appropriate controls. Patients were administered 6g/day of ALA, for two months. We report the absence of side effects. Such as fishy aftertaste and gastrointestinal distress, in addition to a slight decrease of C-reactive protein concentrations (Identifier: ISRCTN13118704). © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

J		Cayan, F.; Tel-Cayan, G.; Deveci, E.; Duru, M. E.							A comprehensive study on phenolic compounds and bioactive properties of five mushroom species via chemometric approach.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study was planned to investigate the phenolic compounds, cholinesterase inhibitory, and antioxidant activities of Chondrostereum purpureum (CP), Hymenochaete rubiginosa (HR), Macrolepiota procera (MP), Phaeolus schweinitzii (PS), and Phellinus igniarius (PI) mushroom species. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-DAD) was used for the characterization of the phenolic compounds. The main compound was identified as fumaric acid in C. purpureum (CP), M. procera (MP), and P. igniarius (PI); protocatechuic acid in H. rubiginosa (HR); 6,7-dihydroxy coumarin in P. schweinitzii (PS). P. schweinitzii methanol (PSM) extract had close or higher activity than standards in ABTS.+ (IC50: 2.960.15 g/ml), DPPH (80.560.53%), CUPRAC (A0.50: 5.260.19 g/ml), beta-carotene-linoleic acid (IC50: 1.160.14 g/ml) assays. In addition, P. schweinitzii methanol (PSM) extract showed potential inhibitory activity against AChE (56.380.09%). The relationship between the phenolic compounds, antioxidant, and cholinesterase inhibitory activity results and the mushroom species were examined using principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Practical applications: This study revealed that studied mushroom species have significant antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activities and are found to be rich in phenolic compounds. The mushroom species were clustered with their antioxidant and cholinesterase inhibitory activities and phenolic compounds data according to the PCA and HCA analysis. Overall, the results described in this study increase the contribution and emphasis on the potential use of these mushrooms as a source of versatile biological agents. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Study of the impacts of electro-activated solutions of calcium lactate, calcium ascorbate and their equimolar mixture combined with moderate heat treatments on the spores of Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 under model conditions and in fresh salmon.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Widespread in very diverse environments, the spores of Bacillus cereus are highly resistant to hostile conditions and can contaminate a huge variety of food products, posing a potential health hazard to consumers. Given this significant risk, the objective of this research work was to study the impacts of electro-activated solutions (EAS) made with calcium ascorbate, calcium lactate, and their equimolar mixture on Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579 spores in model conditions and food matrix, the fresh Atlantic salmon. The model conditions consisted of a direct application of the EAS to the spores, which avoided any interference with factors external to those of the solutions. Salmon was chosen as a food model because it is a product sensitive to bacterial spoilage and can be eaten raw. To achieve this, the solutions were prepared by electro-activation using an electric current with an intensity of 750 mA for 30 min, resulting in mean pH values of 1.940.15-2.160.01 and titratable acidity of 0.1020.001-0.1090.001 mol/L, depending on the type of solution. These conditions were chosen because of their excellent antibacterial efficacy previously demonstrated against vegetative cells of B. cereus. The results showed high sporicidal activities of the EAS against B. cereus with a 7 to 9 log reduction, using an initial spore population of 109 CFU/mL, depending on the conditions evaluated, namely: in direct contact (2-30 min), in salmon used as a food matrix (2-7 min), and in combination with moderate heat treatments from 60 to 90°C (0.5-2 min). In addition, it was observed that the sporicidal capacity of the EAS increased with temperature and the contact time. Otherwise, analysis of the color and lipids of the salmon have not shown any major impacts of the use of EAS as a rinsing solution for this highly perishable food. Furthermore, micrographs taken by scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed the destructive effects of the EAS used in the vital structures/components of the spores. In general, this study has demonstrated that the electro-activation technology is effective in producing EAS capable of destroying/inactivating B. cereus spores and that they can be used for the improvement of food safety and preservation.

Impact of pregelatinized composite flour on nutritional and functional properties of gluten-free cereal-based cake premixes.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The beneficial effects of a healthy diet on the quality of life become the nutritional and the functional values crucial aspects of gluten-free products. Therefore, the present study aimed attention at optimizing cake premix formulations, based on gluten-free cereals (red sorghum whole-grain and polished rice), using orange pomace flour and whey powder as nutrient-rich by-products. The main goal is to investigate the nutritional and functional characteristics of gluten-free cakes made from premixes. The simplex-centroid mixture design was used to evaluate the effect of red sorghum whole-grain, polished rice, and pregelatinized composite flours on the nutritional (protein, lipid, ash, total dietary fiber, and carbohydrates contents and in vitro protein digestibility) and functional (total phenolic content and antioxidant capacities) properties of gluten-free cakes made from premixes. All gluten-free cakes in this study can be labeled as protein and dietary fiber sources, besides being enriched in bioactive compounds. A joined analysis of all nutritional and functional characteristics presented in this study highlights that our optimized gluten-free cereal-based cakes meet environmental and physiological sustainabilities because the employment of red sorghum whole-grain and pregelatinized composite flours were very effective in the improvement of these characteristics, even after these ingredients were subjected to two thermal processes (thermoplastic extrusion and baking). ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Whole-grain sorghum, orange pomace, and whey blends as a novel gluten-free pregelatinized ingredient: assessment of physicochemical and pasting properties (sorghum-based pregelatinized flour).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to obtain gluten-free pregelatinized composite flours. A central composite rotational design was employed to study the impact of variation of the amount of whole-grain sorghum flour, the conditioning moisture in composite flour, and the temperature in the third zone of the extruder on the flour properties. Conditioning moisture was the parameter that most influenced peak viscosity, trough, final viscosity, and setback of flours. Pregelatinized composite flours with similar pasting properties to cross-linked chemically modified sorghum starches were obtained. While the sorghum flour presented 83.6 °C for pasting temperature, 489 cP for peak viscosity, and 1,329 cP for setback, the pregelatinized composite flours presented values between 69-74.4 °C, 129-257 cP, and 108-311 cP, respectively. The variation of the process and formulation parameters resulted in the production of flours with well-differentiated pasting properties that would meet specific technological features for application in various foodstuffs, and some optimizations for food applications were shown. Practical applications. Broadly driven by consumers who voluntarily avoid or limit gluten in their diets, the demand for gluten-free (GF) products continues strong in the foodservice and retail sectors. Besides, GF has become an expectation for consumers seeking "clean label" products. However, the formulation and the manufacture of baked goods without gluten results in considerable technological problems for both cereal technologists and bakers. Limited research has been performed on the heat treatment of whole-grain sorghum flour. This study provides essential information about the technological characteristics of sorghum-based pregelatinized flours, especially related to their pasting properties. The results show that using these flours will be a good alternative for replacing cross-linked chemically modified sorghum starches. Besides, these flours are valuable to increase the diversity of sustainable products made with gluten-free whole-grain cereals, easily suiting a "clean label ingredients.

"Ataulfo" peel and pulp against oxidative stress in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Oxidative stress has been implicated in the pathogenesis and progression of diabetes mellitus. Both can damage the brain. Mango and its by-products are sources of bioactive compounds with antioxidant properties. We hypothesized that mango cv. "Ataulfo" peel and pulp mitigate oxidative stress in the brain of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Results. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: control, untreated diabetic (UD), diabetic treated with a mango-supplemented diet (MTD), and diabetic pretreated with a mango-supplemented diet (MPD). The rats were fed the different diets for 4weeks after diabetes induction (MTD), or 2weeks before and 4weeks after induction (MPD). After the intervention, serum and brain (cerebellum and cortex) were collected to evaluate gene expression, enzyme activity, and redox biomarkers. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) expression increased in the cortex of the MTD group, whereas glutathione-S-transferase p1 (GSTp1) expression was higher in the cortex of the MTD group, and cortex and cerebellum of the MPD group. SOD1 activity was higher in the cerebellum and cortex of all diabetic groups, whereas GST activity increased in the cerebellum and cortex of the MPD group. Lipid peroxidation increased in the cerebellum and cortex of the UD group; however, a mango-supplemented diet prevented this increase in both regions, while also mitigating polyphagia and weight loss, and maintaining stable glycemia in diabetic rats. Conclusion. We propose that mango exerts potent neuroprotective properties against diabetes-induced oxidative stress. It can be an alternative to prevent and treat biochemical alterations caused by diabetes. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Spatial fingerprinting: horizontal fusion of multi-dimensional bio-tracers as solution to global food provenance problems.		Foods					Building the capacity of efficiently determining the provenance of food products represents a crucial step towards the sustainability of the global food system. Despite species specific empirical examples of multi-tracer approaches to provenance, the precise benefit and efficacy of multi-tracers remains poorly understood. Here we show why, and when, data fusion of bio-tracers is an extremely powerful technique for geographical provenance discrimination. Specifically, we show using extensive simulations how, and under what conditions, geographical relationships between bio-tracers (e.g., spatial covariance) can act like a spatial fingerprint, in many naturally occurring applications likely allowing rapid identification with limited data. To highlight the theory, we outline several statistic methodologies, including artificial intelligence, and apply these methodologies as a proof of concept to a limited data set of 90 individuals of highly mobile Sockeye salmon that originate from 3 different areas. Using 17 measured bio-tracers, we demonstrate that increasing combined bio-tracers results in stronger discriminatory power. We argue such applications likely even work for such highly mobile and critical fisheries as tuna. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Cazzaniga, A.; Brousse, M. M.; Linares, R. A.							Variation of color with baking time in snacks made with pregelatinized cassava.		Journal of Food Science					Color is an important aspect when formulating products, as the consumer will evaluate this aspect in the first instance. There is a growing interest in non-wheat producing regions to replace it with local sources of starches. However, the substitution of wheat flour affects characteristics such as texture, flavor, and color of the intermediate and final products. The objective of this work was to determine if the variation of the baking time allows reducing the color difference that the replacement of flour generates by dehydrated cassava puree (DCP). For that, four replacement levels were evaluated using the CIE-L * a * b * and CIE-L * C * H * methodology. The browning index and total color difference (DeltaE) between samples with different replacement levels and between different stages of production were also evaluated. It was proved that the decrease in the baking time allowed the development of a similar coloring between snacks made with DCP and those made without substitution. Also, moisture values of less than 5% (dry basis) were obtained in the snacks. The browning index increased with the proportion of DCP in flour and doughs, but not in baked snacks. The pregelatinization of starches could be a mechanism to improve the quality of products with substitutions of wheat flour. Practical Application. Color is a critical attribute of foods in consumer acceptance. The accelerated color development that pregelatinized cassava starch produces in the appearance of baked goods can be useful for food development. A quick color development can mean shorter exposure time to heat, which is important for some products with heat-sensitive components. Also, it is interesting to note that the cassava dehydrated puree is a gluten-free product. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A growing interest in promoting the use of local sources of flour for the partial replacement of wheat flour is observed. Dehydrated cassava puree (DCP) is obtained by cooking, mashing, and drying the cassava roots. The objective was to evaluate the physicochemical and functional properties of DCP and its influence on the texture of unfermented doughs. Four blends with different proportions of wheat flour and DCP were used. The physical and functional properties of the blends were correlated (p < 0.05) with the results of TPA, forward extrusion, compression, and extensibility tests carried out with the TA. XT-plus texture analyzer. The DCP doughs presented higher consistency, cohesiveness, elasticity, resilience, hardness, and gumminess than wheat flour dough. Those textural parameters were correlated (>0.90) with properties such as average particle size and water absorption. The use of DCP for dough production is viable, and its texture characteristics are suitable for industrial processes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Hydrocolloids					The ability of lactoferrin (LF)/gum arabic (GA) electrostatic complexes to be used as emulsifiers to form and stabilize high internal phase emulsions (HIPEs) was investigated. The effects of protein-polysaccharide ratio and pH on interfacial adsorption and emulsifying capacity were investigated. The ability of cationic LF to adsorb to the oil droplet surfaces was enhanced by the addition of anionic GA. The properties of the interfacial LF/GA complexes could be tuned by varying solution pH, as shown by changes in particle size, turbidity, zeta-potential, and atomic force microscopy. The impacts of pH, salt addition, and heating on the microstructure, stability, rheology of the HIPEs systems were investigated. Curcumin was used as a model lipophilic nutraceutical to investigate the potential of the HIPEs to improve the photostability of encapsulated bioactives. The LF/GA complexes stabilized HIPEs showed gel-like structures, good creaming stability, and excellent environmental stability. This study provides a useful approach for designing HIPEs with improved functional performance. For instance, HIPEs may be used in semi-solid foods to improve their textural characteristics or nutritional profiles.

J		Ce Qi; Mengfan Ding; Shuangqi Li; Qin Zhou; Duo Li; Renqiang Yu; Jin Sun							Sex-dependent modulation of immune development in mice by secretory IgA-coated Lactobacillus reuteri isolated from breast milk.		Journal of Dairy Science					Lactobacilli, commonly present in human breast milk, appear to colonize the neonatal gut and provide protection to infants against various infections, thereby promoting immune development. This study examined the potential probiotic role of breast milk-derived Lactobacillus reuteri FN041 in immune development in mice. The FN041 were gavaged either to BALB/c dams (n=6/group) during the lactation period or to their offspring (n=6/sex per intervention) after weaning separately (cointervention). All interventions induced increased intestinal barriers in 5-wk-old offspring, especially in the females. Immunoglobulin A plasmocytes in ileal tissue and secretory IgA (sIgA) in ileal contents increased in all 5-wk-old offspring of cointervention. The activation of mRNA expression of 17 genes was sex-dependent, especially in 5-wk-old offspring. Broader genes were regulated in female mice. The effect of cointervention on the Shannon index of total microbiota is sex-related. The Shannon index of sIgA-coated microbiota increased in both sexes. The sIgA-coated microbiota showed intergroup differences according to beta diversity, especially in female mice that showed an increase in Bifidobacterium of Actinobacteria. The sIgA-coated Bifidobacterium was positively correlated with mRNA expression of Tlr9. The sIgA-coated Lactobacillus in male offspring was negatively correlated with mRNA expression of Cldn2. In conclusion, L. reuteri FN041 promoted the production of intestinal sIgA and the expression of genes related to antimicrobial peptides in the offspring and enhanced the function of the mucosal barrier, depending on sex and treatment manner.

J		Ce Shi; Knochel, S.							Susceptibility of dairy associated molds towards microbial metabolites with focus on the response to diacetyl.		Food Control					Food spoilage may cause food waste, economic losses and even brand image deterioration. In fermented dairy products, spoilage by molds is frequently occurring and the molds are commonly being introduced at the consumer stage after opening. Diverse molds may be involved with the main genera being Penicillium, Mucor, and Cladosporium. Fungal growth may be inhibited by bioprotective cultures by competition and/or production of inhibitive compounds. Several compounds produced by a range of lactic acid bacteria have been reported as having an antifungal activity against certain fungi. Susceptibility tests of a panel of dairy associated molds towards twelve of these pure compounds were performed using microtiter plate well method. Diacetyl was the most potent antifungal among the compounds followed by octanoic acid. Large variations were seen within the Penicillium strains tested with P. commune being more sensitive than P. roquefortii, and two Mucor strains generally exhibiting high tolerance. The growth of two susceptible Penicillium strains in yoghurt serum with pH 4.6 with increasing amounts of diacetyl added were followed. Susceptibility varied but at 64mug/mL, both strains were completely inhibited on yoghurt regardless of temperature. At higher pH (5.6) in malt extract agar (MEA), growth was faster but inhibition was still observed. Upon exposure to diacetyl, the level of cytoplasmic reactive oxygen species (ROS) increased and impairment of membrane integrity and leakage of cellular materials were observed. These findings provide new knowledge of the activity of diacetyl against molds. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	121				0956-7135				10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107573					FSTA:2021-04-Pl2111
J		Ce Shi; Jiaran Zhang; Zhixin Jia; Xinting Yang; Zhongyun Zhou							Intelligent pH indicator films containing anthocyanins extracted from blueberry peel for monitoring tilapia fillet freshness.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Fish spoilage leads to an increase in the pH value of the fish. A colorimetric pH indicator can be used to monitor fish spoilage and has been exploited in intelligent packaging because of its simplicity, practicality and low cost. The aim of this study was to develop two pH-indicator films comprising starch (S), tara gum (TG), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and anthocyanins extracted from blueberry peel and the films were then used to monitor the freshness of tilapia fillets during storage at 25 and 4 °C. Results. The ultraviolet-visible (UV-visible) spectra and color of anthocyanins changed within pH 2-10. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, UV-visible spectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopy certified that blueberry peel extract (BPE) had been introduced into the S/PVA and TG/PVA matrices. Visual color changes in the films occurred at pH 2-8. A freshness application test was conducted in tilapia fillets stored at 4 and 25 °C, and visual color changes in the films were observed. The TG/PVA/BPE film had a greater color difference (Delta E) from pink and transparent to dark yellow at 25 °C and to dark purple at 4 °C than Delta E of S/PVA/BPE film, which sufficiently correlated with the change of total volatile base nitrogen (TVB-N) and total aerobic counts (TACs) of fillets. Conclusion. It can be concluded that the color changes of TG/PVA/BPE films were corresponded with TVB-N and TAC values of tilapia fillets, which presented great potential as a visual package label to monitor fish freshness at ambient and chilled temperatures. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	5	1800	1811	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10794					FSTA:2021-07-Rc2378
