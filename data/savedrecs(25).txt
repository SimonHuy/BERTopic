J		Anderson, F.; Payne, C.; Pannier, L.; Pethick, D. W.; Gardner, G. E.							The potential for dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to predict lamb eating quality.		Meat Science					Data were obtained from 120 lambs which were slaughtered, scanned using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and underwent eating quality assessment. DEXA images were used to determine R values, reflecting atomic mass, to predict carcass lean%. Additionally, bone regions (humerus, lumbar, femur and "all carcass bone") were isolated from images to determine bone specific R values (DEXA R Mean and SDev). Prediction of overall liking of cuts across the carcass (scored between 0 and 100) using lean% and bone DEXA was variable. Loin grill overall liking demonstrated significant associations with lumbar DEXA R Mean and SDev, decreasing by 8.6 and 7.6 units across the increasing range of these bone DEXA measures. This association is somewhat independent of carcass lean% and intramuscular fat% of the loin. Given the association of DEXA with eating quality, there are potential benefits for the lamb industry with respect to carcass sorting and marketing during routine processing and DEXA scanning.

J		Anderson, N. T.; Walsh, K. B.; Flynn, J. R.; Walsh, J. P.							Achieving robustness across season, location and cultivar for a NIRS model for intact mango fruit dry matter content. II. Local PLS and nonlinear models.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					A range of modelling techniques were used in the estimation of dry matter content of intact mango fruit from short wave near infrared spectra, collected using an interactance geometry, with models developed on a data set collected across three seasons (n=10,243) and tested on that of a fourth season (n=1,448). Model types included Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Local Optimized by Variance Regression (LOVR), Local Partial Least Squares Regression (LPLS), Local PLS Scores (LPLS-S) and Memory Based Learner (MBL), with manual tuning of parameters undertaken. Additionally, two commercially available cloud-based chemometric packages for automated model development were trialled. All of these models gave a better result than use of a global PLS model. The best result (lowest RMSEP) was achieved with an ensemble of ANN, GPR and LPLS-S, with the best individual model result achieved by LOVR, with RMSEP of 0.839% and 0.881%, respectively, compared to the global PLS result of 1.014%. The best precision was achieved with the LPLS model, with a SEP of 0.846%, compared to the global PLS result of 1.012%. LOVR was twice as fast as a generalized latent variable selection method LPLS-S-cv in prediction of independent validation set (at 58.7*10-3 s compared to 163*10-3 s). The ANN model was satisfactory in all categories (prediction speed, model build speed, and prediction statistics) and insensitive to tuning, e.g., 33 of the 70 parameter combinations were within 0.05 units of RMSEP of the minimum combination. However, the ANN learning rate was low. For applications that require "real-time" prediction, such as fruit packlines, use of ANN and GPR models is recommended. For non-cloud based handheld NIR devices lacking the computational power to perform local modelling, ANN is recommended, and LOVR or a model ensemble recommended in cloud based implementation. The automated cloud-based systems performed well (RMSEP of 0.850% and 0.963% for Hone Create and DataRobot, ensemble models, respectively), without human intervention for the choosing and tuning of models.

J		Anderson, S.; Gonzalez, L. A.; Jasbi, P.; Johnston, C. S.							Evidence that daily vinegar ingestion may contribute to erosive tooth wear in adults.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Vinegar ingestion at mealtime is gaining popularity for its antiglycemic effects; however, it is among the most acidic consumable substances. This study examined tooth wear in healthy adults participating in an 8-week randomized trial examining the effect of daily vinegar ingestion on insulin sensitivity and visceral fat reduction. Twice daily participants consumed a vinegar drink (two tablespoons vinegar in a cup of water; 3.6g acetic acid) or a commercial vinegar pill (control, 0.045g acetic acid) at mealtime. Participants were screened for dental erosion using the basic erosive wear examination (BEWE) by a blinded registered dental hygienist at trial baseline and week 8. Mean BEWE scores did not change in the control group but increased 18% in the vinegar group over the 8-week study (P=.038). Given the current popularity of vinegar as a medicinal agent, practitioners should caution patients who utilize this strategy on the possibility of erosive tooth wear. Trial registration. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03577834) on July 5,2018 and the institutional review board at Arizona State University provided ethical approval (STUDY00005418).										2021	24	8	894	896	1096-620X				10.1089/jmf.2020.0108					FSTA:2022-02-Tc0663
J		Anderssen, K. E.; Syed, S.; Stormo, S. K.							Quantification and mapping of tissue damage from freezing in cod by magnetic resonance imaging.		Food Control					Freezing of fish is an important processing method that can extend the shelf life of the product but can also lead to significant damage to the tissue if performed incorrectly. In order to thoroughly evaluate different freezing protocols, a method to characterize the extent and distribution of damage from freezing is needed. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was tested as a technique to map and quantify tissue damage from freezing in fish. Groups of packaged cod (Gadus morhua) loin were frozen to either -5, -20, or -40 °C, thawed and then imaged with a T2-weighted MRI sequence. Areas of damage appear as bright clusters in the muscle tissue. To provide repeatable, objective classification, image analysis using a convolutional neural network was then performed on the MRI data to identify regions of damaged tissue. As expected, the colder the freezing procedure, the less damage the process generally produced. Results. Show non-uniform damage throughout the fillet, with tissue damage due to freezing concentrated in the center of the fillet. This suggests that surface limited methods, such as hyperspectral imaging, may not fully capture the extent of damage due to freezing and thawing. The percent of tissue classified as damaged by the neural network generally correlated well with liquid loss (cor=0.83). All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Particle morphology and rehydration properties of spray-dried microgels and fractal aggregates with varying fractions of native milk serum proteins.		International Dairy Journal					To keep their functional properties, it is crucial that protein aggregates maintain their structure after spray drying and that the powders can be fully rehydrated. In this study, microgels and fractal aggregates were prepared by heating a mixture of milk serum protein concentrate and lactose (40/60; %, w/w) at 85 °C for 15 min by varying the pH. Various fractions of native proteins were added to the systems prior to spray drying. This study showed that microgels and fractal aggregates kept their structure after spray drying and reconstitution. The particle morphology could be correlated to the stiffness of the interface of the feed droplet. The forced imbibition rate showed a negative correlation with increasing amount of aggregated proteins in the powders that seems to be a result of denatured/aggregated proteins present at the surface. These findings are of importance for the formulation of spray-dried powders with improved rehydration characteristics. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

QSAR-based physicochemical properties of isothiocyanate antimicrobials against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Isothiocyanates (ITCs) derived from Brassicaceae are potential food preservatives. Their antimicrobial activity is strongly influenced by their subclass and side chain. This is the first quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) study of ITCs as antibacterials. Twenty-six ITCs covering 9 subclasses were tested against Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and growth inhibitory response (GIR) were determined and used to develop QSAR models. MIC of the most active ITCs was 6.3-9.4 mug/mL. The QSAR models were validated with leave-one-out cross validation. The proposed models had a good fit (R2adj 0.86-0.93) and high internal predictive power (Q2adj 0.80-0.89). Partial charge, polarity, reactivity, and shape of ITCs were key physicochemical properties underlying antibacterial activity of ITCs. Furthermore, ITC compositions and antibacterial activity of Sinapis alba, Brassica napus, B. juncea, B. oleracea, and Camelina sativa extracts were determined, after myrosinase treatment. B. oleracea ITC-rich extract showed promising activity (MIC 750-1000 mug/mL) against both bacteria. C. sativa ITC-rich extract showed promising activity (MIC 188 mug/mL) against B. cereus. The QSAR models successfully predicted activity of the extracts based on ITC compositions. The models are useful to predict antibacterial activity of new ITCs and ITC-rich mixtures. Brassicaceae ITC-rich extracts are promising natural food preservatives. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Microstructures of potato protein hydrogels and aerogels produced by thermal crosslinking and supercritical drying.		Food Hydrocolloids					Aerogels are highly porous structur′es created from hydrogels by solvent exchange and supercritical CO2 drying. They can be produced from proteins and used for encapsulation of active ingredients. In this work, the structural relationship between various protein based hydrogels and aerogels was investigated. We compare egg white protein (EWP) and patatin rich potato protein isolates (PPI) in terms of gel and aerogel production thereof. Thereby, aerogels were produced for the first time from patatin-rich potato protein isolates. Both protein sources can form strong hydrogels, but they differ in their molecular properties, especially regarding the presence of reactive groups available for covalent crosslinking. Therefore, we studied the rheological profiles of hydrogels of both protein groups and applied the ratio of elastic modulus at gel formation temperature (G′hot) and after cooling to ambient temperature (G′cool) as criterion for comparing gel formation capacities produced from structurally different proteins. The ratio G′cool/G′hot was also identified as an indicator of the relation of non-covalent bonds to covalent and/or hydrophobic interactions and for characterizing aerogel structural properties. PPI hydrogels were found to be dominated by hydrophobic interactions, while covalent disulfide bonds determine EWP hydrogel stabilization. Nevertheless, PPI and EWP hydrogel and aerogels showed similar stabilities. More than the protein source, the pH during hydrogel formation was found to decisively influence the protein interaction potential and gel/aerogel characteristics. Irrespective of the protein source low pH led to brittle aerogels with high specific surface areas and low G'cool/G′hot ratios. At a pH close to the isoelectric point (IEP) brittle gels with low specific surface areas and high G′cool/G′hot ratios were measured. At alkaline pH gels were most stable, the specific surface area and G′cool/G′hot ratios were intermediate. Overall, the results help to control the structural properties of gels and aerogels towards potential applications in food systems. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Andlinger, D. J.; Roscheisen, P.; Hengst, C.; Kulozik, U.							Influence of pH, temperature and protease inhibitors on kinetics and mechanism of thermally induced aggregation of potato proteins.		Foods					Understanding aggregation in food protein systems is essential to control processes ranging from the stabilization of colloidal dispersions to the formation of macroscopic gels. Patatin rich potato protein isolates (PPI) have promising techno-functionality as alternatives to established proteins from egg white or milk. In this work, the influence of pH and temperature on the kinetics of PPI denaturation and aggregation was investigated as an option for targeted functionalization. At a slightly acidic pH, rates of denaturation and aggregation of the globular patatin in PPI were fast. These aggregates were shown to possess a low amount of disulfide bonds and a high amount of exposed hydrophobic amino acids (S). Gradually increasing the pH slowed down the rate of denaturation and aggregation and alkaline pH levels led to an increased formation of disulfide bonds within these aggregates, whereas S was reduced. Aggregation below denaturation temperature (Td) favored aggregation driven by disulfide bridge formation. Aggregation above Td led to fast unfolding, and initial aggregation was less determined by disulfide bridge formation. Inter-molecular disulfide formation occurred during extended heating times. Blocking different protein interactions revealed that the formation of disulfide bond linked aggregation is preceded by the formation of non-covalent bonds. Overall, the results help to control the kinetics, morphology, and interactions of potato protein aggregation for potential applications in food systems. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ando, H.; Imaizumi, T.							Changes in electrical properties and void distribution of mung bean sprouts during hot water heating.		Food Science and Technology Research					We investigated the relationships between electrical properties and tissue structures, including the cell membrane, and the voids of fresh and heated bean sprouts. The electrical properties, which were obtained by electrical impedance spectroscopy and equivalent circuit analysis, changed drastically within 60 s by heating at 70 °C. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy suggested that these changes are due to cell membrane damage. We also visualized void distribution using micro X-ray computed tomography imaging and the calculated porosity. The porosity decreased from 6.71% to less than 1% after 30 s of heating. The fresh samples showed several axially elongated voids with low sphericity (< 0.3) and high volume (> 105 m3), which then disappeared preferentially with heating. Moreover, extracellular resistance was highly correlated with porosity (R = 0.900). We suggest that the contribution of cell membrane and void conditions to the texture of bean sprouts for short heating times needs to be considered.										2021	27	2	311	318	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.27.311					FSTA:2021-10-Jp13535

Influence of under-fermented cocoa mass in chocolate production: sensory acceptance and volatile profile characterization during the processing.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Under-fermented cocoa mass (UCM) presents, as well as the fresh cocoa seed, a high content of phenolics compounds. For this reason, a chocolate with UCM added to the fermented cocoa mass (FCM) was developed. The sensory quality of chocolate is broadly determined by the composition of volatile compounds resulted from microbial metabolism during fermentation and Maillard reactions, that occur during drying, roasting, and conching. The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of adding UCM (20%-80%) to the FCM on the sensory characteristics of the chocolates produced and their volatile profiles during the process chain. The UCM and FCM were obtained through fermentation (48 h and 144 h, respectively), drying, roasting, and grinding processes. In general, the chocolate samples with a higher content of UCM presented lower scores for flavor acceptance, due to their higher bitterness and astringency. The great acceptance was observed on samples with 80% and 65% of FCM. A total of 55 different volatile compounds were identified by HS-SPME-GC-MS. The PCA analyses showed that the profile of the volatile compounds in the chocolate samples was influenced by the fermentation process, as well as the chocolate quality (flowery, honey, fruit, roasted, and chocolate flavors).

Kluyveromyces lactis and Torulaspora delbrueckii: Probiotic characterization, anti-Salmonella effect, and impact on cheese quality.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cheese presents remarkable diversity and organoleptic richness favored by microbial communities. Different yeasts have already been reported as contributors to cheese characteristics. In this study we aimed to characterize K. lactis B10 and T. delbrueckii B14 probiotic potential and to evaluate their impact on cheese. Yeasts were subjected to hemolysis, mucin degradation, co-aggregation with pathogens, in vivo survival, and antagonism to salmonellosis. Cheeses were produced with pasteurized milk coagulated using commercial rennet. Cheeses were evaluated for texture profile and sensory acceptance up to 40 days of maturation. Both yeasts presented higher co-aggregation to Salmonella than Saccharomyces boulardii. Although both yeasts satisfactorily survived the passage through the gastrointestinal tract, only K. lactis B10 resulted in high survival rate (90%) of mice against salmonellosis. Cheese produced with yeasts on the surface presented no eyes formation, while yeasts inoculated in the mass increased eyes formation. At 21 days of maturation yeasts inoculated in the mass resulted in lower hardness (1787.91), gumminess (1528.70) and chewiness (1339.63). Taste and purchase intention were higher for the cheese produced with yeasts inoculated in the mass. For all maturation times evaluated, most of the tasters expressed a preference for the cheese produced with yeasts inoculation in the mass.

J		Andrade, J.; Rousseau, D.							Whipping properties of recombined, additive-free creams.		Journal of Dairy Science					There is increasing industrial interest in the use of the milkfat globule membrane as a food ingredient. The objective of this research was to determine whether the aerosol whipping performance of cream separated into butter and buttermilk, and then recombined, would perform in a manner similar to untreated cream. Churning of cream tempered to different solid fat contents was used to separate butter from buttermilk, which were then recombined at the same ratios as the initial extraction yield, or with 25% extra buttermilk. Differences in milkfat globule size distributions among the recombined creams were apparent; however, their whipping behavior and overrun were similar. Importantly, all recombined creams did not yield properties similar to the original cream, indicating that the unique native milkfat globule membrane structure plays a role in cream performance well beyond its simple presence.

Evaluation of bioactive compounds, phytochemicals profile and antioxidant potential of the aqueous and ethanolic extracts of some traditional fruit tree leaves used in Brazilian folk medicine.		Food Research International					The aim of this study was to analyze eight selected species of leaves, used in the traditional medicine of the Northeast region of Brazil obtained from several fruit trees (grageru, soursop, jambolanum, passion fruit, insulin, nogueira, pedra ume kaa and stevia), regarding their polyphenols contents and antioxidant activity. Condensed and hydrolysable tannins, phenolics and flavonoids contents were determined and the antioxidant activities measured by ABTS, FRAP and ORAC assays. Organic acids were analyzed by HPLC-DAD system. Phenolic compounds of aqueous and ethanolic extracts were determined by UHPLC-DAD-MS. The results revealed high contents of total phenolics (13.340.19-127.650.21 mg. G-1 of GAE: QE (2:1) of sample) and flavonoids (12.300.42-71.790.00 mg.g-1 QE of sample). The ABTS results exhibited extraordinary activity in the extracts (74.486.23-1487.332.67 mol Trolox.g-1 of sample). Acids quinic, tartaric, citric, gallic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic and vanillic along with naringenin, rutin, vanillin, catechin, epicatechin, kaempferol were the most important compounds. Thus, these leaves extracts may be considered as sources of phenolics compounds having a high potential as natural antioxidants. In addition, the polyphenols present in these leaves have many beneficial effects and can also be used in medicinal and nutraceuticals products with enhanced bioactivities.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In the present study a newly tannase enzyme from Penicillium rolfsii CCMB 714 was immobilized on calcium alginate and its efficiency in clarifying juice was analyzed. The efficiency of immobilization was 99.5% and the enzyme maintained an activity above 50% after 6 cycles of reuse. Immobilization of tannase enzyme changed the optimum temperature from 33 to 44 °C, and the optimum pH from 4.0 to 4.3. The immobilized tannase enzyme showed greater thermal and pH stability when compared to the free form, maintaining 80% of its activity at 50 °C and more than 50% of residual activity at all pH tested for up to 16 h. The immobilized enzyme was also resistant to almost all additives used (cations, SDS and EDTA). When tested in apple juice, the immobilized tannase efficiently clarified the juice showing the reduction of more than 70% in turbidity. Such results showing that the P. rolfsii CCMB 714 immobilized tannase was suitable to clarify apple juice and have a potential for future beverage industrial application mainly in juice processing. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Andre, S.; Charton, A.; Pons, A.; Vannier, C.; Couvert, O.							Viability of bacterial spores surviving heat-treatment is lost by further incubation at temperature and pH not suitable for growth.		Food Microbiology					Spores from 21 strains from different genera were heat-treated and stored in different sets of process conditions (4 temperatures and 3 pH levels) defined to prevent growth. In these conditions, spores surviving the heat treatment progressively lost viability during storage. Different inactivation curve shapes (linear, shoulder and tailing) and different sensitivities to storage were observed. B. coagulans showed the fastest inactivation kinetics, with more than 4-log reduction of spore population within 24 h after heating and G. stearothermophilus displayed slower inactivation kinetics, whereas all the anaerobic strains studied (M. thermoacetica and Thermoanaerobacterium spp.) proved resistant to storage conditions, with no destruction detected during 90 days in most cases. Inactivation rates were relatively unaffected by sub-lethal pH but sharply accelerated by temperature: Inactivation became faster as temperature increased (in the 8 °C-55 °C temperature range), with growth blocked by low pH in sub-lethal temperatures. There were changes in surviving spore numbers after the heat-treatment phase. This has implications and applications in canned food industries, as the probability of a retorted sample testing as non-stable, meaning possible spoilage, may decrease with time. In simple terms, a batch of low-acid canned food that tests as non-shelf-stable after an incubation test i.e. positive growth conditions, may later become negative if stored at room temperature (below the minimal growth temperature for thermophilic spores), which may change the marketability of the batch.

J		Andreani, E. S.; Mingqin Li; Ronholm, J.; Karboune, S.							Feruloylation of polysaccharides from cranberry and characterization of their prebiotic properties.		Food Bioscience					Humicola insolens feruloyl esterase was immobilized on chemically modified epoxy-activated supports of different pore sizes. Native and immobilized feruloyl esterases were investigated for their esterification activity on raffinose in surfactantless microemulsions. Pectic polysaccharides, obtained from cranberry pomace using chelating agent (CH) and diluted alkaline (DA) extractions, were then esterified at the optimized conditions. Using CH polysaccharide extract as a substrate, immobilized feruloyl esterase led to higher feruloylation (22.1-26.6%) than the free enzyme (4.2%), and yielded polysaccharides with a higher increase in the total phenolic content. Free and immobilized feruloyl esterases acted similarly in the feruloylation of polysaccharides present in the DA extract, identified as being rich in rhamnogalacturonan I neutral branches. The prebiotic activity score showed that cranberry pectic polysaccharides were better fermented than inulin and generated abundant propionic acid. Increased feruloylation of cranberry polysaccharides had a negative impact on the growth of Lactobacillus brevis and Bifidobacterium longum strains. The total short chain fatty acid concentration showed that the presence of feruloylation affected DA polysaccharides more than CH ones. This showed the importance of controlling the feruloylation extent as a compromise between the prebiotic and the antioxidant properties.

J		Andreassen, H.; Gjerald, O.; Hansen, K. V.							"The good, the bad, and the minimum tolerable": exploring expectations of institutional food.		Foods					There is a tendency towards greater expectations of consumer goods and services in society-what was once judged as ideal may now be a bare minimum. This presents a challenge for food providers in the upcoming decades. As the more demanding baby boomer cohort ages, health institutions of the future will face challenges meeting their food expectations. The purpose of this study was to explore expectation type dynamics and function with updated empirical material on aging consumers expectations of institutional food and advance our current understanding of how consumers evaluate their expectations. This qualitative study employed in-depth semi structured interviews with 14 informants between the age of 58-79. Content analysis was performed to capture the informants' food expectations based on the expectation hierarchy proposed by Santos and Boote. Analyzing the content and relationship between different expectation types led to three main findings: expectation functions and content, interconnectedness, and the role of affect. Based on the findings, this study contributes by making several propositions for future research and proposes an updated expectancy-disconfirmation model. Importantly, this study provides novel knowledge that can help health institutions understand and meet aging consumers expectations of institutional food. © 2021 by the authors.

Determination of relationships between rumination and milk fat concentration and fatty acid profile using data from commercial rumination sensing systems.		Journal of Dairy Science					Milk fat production is highly influenced by nutrition and rumen fermentation. Rumination is an essential part of the ruminant digestive process and can serve as an indicator of rumen fermentation. The objective of this research was to quantify variation in rumination time between and within dairy herds and test for relationships between rumination time and milk fat production and fatty acid (FA) profile as a proxy of rumen fermentation. Our hypothesis was that rumination may indicate disruptions to rumen fermentation and that cows that spent less time ruminating would have lower milk fat due to these rumen disruptions. Data were collected from 1,733 Holstein cows on 5 commercial dairy farms (4 in Pennsylvania and 1 in New York) of 200 to 700 head using 1 of 2 commercially-available rumination sensing systems, CowManager SensOor ear tags (Agis Automatisering BV) or SCR model HR-LDn neck collars (SCR Engineers). Rumination data were collected for 7 consecutive days leading up to a DHIA test, summed within day, then averaged to obtain mean daily minutes of rumination time. Milk samples from the DHIA test were analyzed for fat content by mid-infrared spectroscopy and for milk FA profile by gas chromatography. Rumination data were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. Rumination time was related to concentration of specific odd- and branched-chain and trans FA in milk but was not directly related to milk fat concentration. Rumination time also did not contribute to models predicting milk fat concentration after accounting for other cow-level variables. There was a linear relationship between trans-10 C18:1 and rumination time that was positive after accounting for the effect of farm (partial R2 of 2.97% across all data, 4.24% in SCR data, and 2.22% in CowManager data). Although rumination time was not related directly to milk fat, it was associated with differences in trans and odd- and branched-chain FA that have been demonstrated to change during subacute ruminal acidosis or biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression, which may affect milk fat and other production variables. These associations suggest that further investigation into using rumination data from commercial systems to predict or identify the presence of these conditions is warranted.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					The objective of this work was to evaluate the potential of Pulsed Electric Field application on the enhancement of air-drying and frying kinetics of zucchini in terms of quality of final zucchini products. PEF-caused electroporation could enhance drying process, facilitating moisture removal with reduced energy consumption, or soften the surface, leading to fried products with reduced oil content. Fresh whole zucchinis (Cucurbita pepo) were PEF treated at 0.5-1.5 kV cm-1 electric field strength for up to 0.5 s, achieving a cell disintegration index in the range of 0.12 to 0.77 (0.5-110 kJ kg-1). Drying experiments of zucchini slices were carried out at mild drying temperatures 40-70 °C. The moisture diffusion coefficients Deff of all studied samples were compared. Deep frying of untreated and PEF treated (1.5 kV cm-1, 500 pulses, Z equal to 0.6, PEF energy input 8.2 kJ kg-1) zucchini slices was carried out at temperatures 150-170 °C for 0-12 min. Water loss, oil uptake and browning index were determined for all studied samples. The obtained results indicate a potential benefit of PEF on drying rates of zucchini tissues. At low drying temperatures, PEF treated samples increased the effective moisture diffusivity Deff up to 35%, reducing the corresponding drying time up to 25 min and leading to energy savings of 169 MJ kg-1 compared to the untreated sample. In addition, PEF treatment led to final fried zucchinis with reduced oil content up to 36% compared to untreated samples while maintaining the same levels of desirable brown color. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Dried figs quality improvement and process energy savings by combinatory application of osmotic pretreatment and conventional air drying.		Foods					This study concerns the implementation of osmotic dehydration (OD) as a pre-treatment of air-drying in fig halves, aiming at drying acceleration, energy savings and product quality improvement. The effect of solid/liquid mass ratio, process temperature (25-45°C) and duration (up to 300 min) on water activity (aw) and transport phenomena during OD, was modelled. The effective diffusion coefficients, drying time and energy consumption, were also calculated during air-drying at 50-70°C. At optimum OD conditions (90 min, 45°C), the highest water loss and solid gain ratio were achieved, while the aw (equal to an initial value 0.986) was decreased to 0.929. Air-drying time of OD-and control samples was estimated at 12 and 21 h, at 60°C, respectively, decreasing the required energy by up to 31.1%. Quality of dried figs was systematically monitored during storage. OD-assisted air-drying led to a product of improved quality and extended shelf-life. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect of pulsed electric field treatment on the kinetics of rehydration, textural properties, and the extraction of intracellular compounds of dried chickpeas.		Journal of Food Science					This study investigated the effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF) pretreatment on rehydration kinetics, firmness, and release of intracellular components of dried chickpeas during rehydration at 35 to 65 °C. After soaking preconditioning, chickpeas were subjected to PEF treatments (2.5 and 3.3 kV/cm, 0.2 to 12.0 kJ/kg, 15 s pulse width, 20 Hz frequency). PEF treated and untreated chickpeas were dried in crossflow air dryer and their rehydration at constant seed/water ratio of 1:5 was studied for 24 hr. During rehydration, moisture, firmness, and concentration of released proteins, carbohydrates and raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFO) were determined and described using appropriate mathematical models. PEF treatment led to up to 70% higher rehydration rates of dried chickpeas. This increase corresponds to rehydration time of approximately 1.5 hr, as opposed to 5 hr for untreated samples. Firmness of PEF treated chickpeas (for energy inputs higher than 3 kJ/kg) during rehydration decreased up to 30% compared to untreated samples. The firmness of untreated samples after 300 min of rehydration was achieved at much shorter times (up to 30 min) for PEF treated samples. At the end of 300 min of rehydration, more than 47.7%, 76.1%, and 86.6% of total raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose, respectively has been extracted, but only 0.03% of nutritionally valuable proteins from PEF treated chickpeas. Consequently, this study demonstrates that PEF processing could be implemented in dried chickpeas processing as pretreatment, for the reduction of rehydration time prior to cooking and of intestinal discomfort caused by RFO. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to determine physicochemical, antioxidant, and antibacterial characteristics of tuna skin gelatin edible films containing glycerol or sorbitol plasticizers with turmeric or eucalyptus essential oils (EOs) and their effect on the fresh beef meat appearance and hardness. The results showed that the addition of EOs caused a significant decrease in transmittance, transparency, water vapor permeability, and solubility but increase the thickness, tensile strength, elongation at break (EAB), and antioxidant activity (p<.05). Sorbitol film had better physical properties than gliserol. Edible films containing 1.5% EO had moderate to strong (9.33-18.83 mm) inhibition for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectra on edible film containing EOs have high amplitude at 2,924.09-2, 931.80 wavenumbers. This edible films applied on beef can maintain the texture and color of up to Day 3. Thus, the addition of turmeric and eucalyptus EO can increase antioxidant and antibacterial activities and decrease physical properties of edible films that can be applied to protect beef quality. Practical applications. In recent years, there has been a significant focus on the development of the biodegradable edible films and such as an approach for reducing the environmental risks resulting from the nonbiodegradable synthetic packing materials. In addition, our edible film developed from tuna skin by product incorporated with turmeric and eucalyptus essential oil also exhibits good antioxidant and antibacterial properties that can extend the shelf life of the food such as fresh beef meat. From the potential point of view, our work should stimulate more research toward the development and optimization of biodegradable edible films with antioxidant and also antibacterial properties. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15701					FSTA:2022-01-Sg0056
J		Andritsos, N. D.; Stasinou, V.; Tserolas, D.; Giaouris, E.							Temperature distribution and hygienic status of domestic refrigerators in Lemnos island, Greece.		Food Control					Chilling is a common food preservation practice applied overwhelmingly in the domestic environment through refrigerator use. Nevertheless, the hygiene conditions and temperatures prevailing in household refrigerators are often inappropriate. Moreover, the way of life in non-or semi-urban settings (e.g., less stress intensive life), such as those encountered in most Greek islands, imposes changes in consumer behavior which are probably being reflected in the domestic hygiene. The purpose of this research was to investigate the hygienic status and temperature distribution of the domestic refrigerators in Lemnos island, Greece. Seventy refrigerators (n = 70) were surveyed by placing temperature data loggers in three different storage areas of each refrigerator (upper shelf, lower shelf, door) and temperature was recorded every 15 min for 24 h. Placement of food in the refrigerators was also monitored and assessed using a predetermined questionnaire. Two food-contact surface samples from each storage area of the refrigerator were collected by swabs (n = 6) for microbiological analyses (total viable count; TVC, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus spp., Salmonella spp., and Listeria spp.). The results demonstrated that only 11.4% of the refrigerators were operating below or equal to 5 °C, whereas most refrigerators (68.6%) were found to operate at temperatures over 7 °C. The majority (77.1%) of survey participants did not correctly place their food commodities in the fridge, according to standard good hygiene practices (GHPs). Salmonella and Listeria were not detected in the refrigerators (i.e., absence in 100 cm2), while E. coli was not recovered (i.e., <1 CFU/cm2) from any of the refrigerator's storage areas. TVCs and total coliforms ranged above the adopted reference values of 1.3 and 1.0 log CFU/cm2 in 41.4 and 2.9% of the refrigerators, respectively. Staphylococci were above the settled limit of 1.0 log CFU/cm2 in 8.6% of the refrigerators, but S. aureus counts were always below this limit (i.e., <1.0 log CFU/cm2). Overall, although the monitored microbiological safety of the sampled domestic refrigerators was satisfactory, the percentage of refrigerators exceeding the acceptable limit in TVC indicates poor cleanliness of home fridges. In addition, both the operating temperatures and placement of food in the refrigerators in many cases did not comply with the recommended GHPs, suggesting a potential risk for the microbiological safety and expected shelf-life of refrigerated food in the kitchen environment. To sum, the present study highlights the necessity of increased consumer awareness and emphasizes the need for further education of the household consumer in proper GHP implementation in their fridges.

J		Andruszkiewicz, P. J.; Corno, M.; Kuhnert, N.							HPLC-MS-based design of experiments approach on cocoa roasting.		Food Chemistry					Modern statistical methods, such as the design of experiments and response surface methodology, are widely used to describe changes in multiparameter processes during the processing of food in both science and technology contexts. However, these approaches are described to a lesser degree in the case of cocoa roasting than other foods and processes. Our study aimed to use the design of experiments to establish a model of cocoa roasting for relevant flavor-related constituents. We have used HPLC-MS techniques to link standard process parameters with chemical compounds changing in concentration during cocoa roasting. Influence of time, temperature, the addition of water, acid, and base, on relative concentrations of procyanidin monomers, dimers, and trimers, an Amadori compound, and a peptide, was shown. High-quality models for each compound were established and validated, displaying good prediction accuracy. Such an approach could be used to optimize processing conditions for cocoa roasting in order to influence the concentration of certain chemical compounds, and in turn, improving the flavor of chocolate products.

J		Andueza, D.; Picard, F.; Hocquette, J. F.; Listrat, A.							Prediction of the intramuscular connective tissue components of fresh and freeze-dried samples by near infrared spectroscopy.		Meat Science					This study compared the performance of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) models on fresh and freeze-dried beef muscle samples to predict intramuscular connective tissue (IMCT) components and to determine whether the accuracy of the models differed among different muscles from beef cattle. The hypothesis was that the water content of muscle samples would negatively influence the accuracy of the models, which would differ among muscles. Fresh and freeze-dried samples (n=171) of four muscles were used to develop NIRS models to predict the contents IMCT. For the total collagen content, the standard error of cross validation (SECV) for model using freeze-dried samples (0.75 mg OH-prol/g DM) was lower than that for model using fresh samples (0.84 mg OH-prol/g DM). For cross-links and proteoglycans, the SECV for models using fresh sample spectra was lower than that for models using freeze-dried sample spectra. The accuracy of the prediction of the models also differed among predicted muscle types. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anedda, R.; Pardu, A.; Korb, J. P.; Curti, E.							Effect of the manufacturing process on Fiore Sardo PDO cheese microstructure by multi-frequency NMR relaxometry.		Food Research International					The quality of Fiore Sardo cheese, a traditional Italian dairy product, was analyzed by means of Multi-frequency Nuclear Magnetic (NMR) relaxometry. Specifically, ten cheese wheels were purchased from different production chains, either industrial (N=5) or artisanal (N=5) samples. The former came from large scale productions and the latter were produced by shepherds in small quantities and in very small dairy factories. A preliminary interlaboratory proficiency testing of Time Domain-NMR (TD-NMR, 20 MHz) relaxometry by five laboratories, consistently showed that product quality is significantly different in terms of molecular mobility according to their production chain (i.e.industrial or artisanal). More detailed information about cheese microstructure was obtained by Multi-frequency Fast Field Cycling NMR (FFC-NMR) at lower magnetic fields (0.01-10 MHz). According to the interpretative model adopted to describe FFC-NMR data, industrially processed cheeses showed a higher para-casein hydration, higher protein protons to water protons ratio and a higher disorder (lower fractal dimension df) than artisanal products. It is suggested that differences between artisanal and industrial cheeses generate from the processing steps preceding cheese maturation, and are clearly reflected in the visual appearance of cheeses. This study shows that NMR relaxometry techniques can successfully discriminate Fiore Sardo cheese from different production chains, and paves the way for their implementation in quality control practices of dairy products.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The medicinal plants, like Alhagi maurorum, have received great attentions, especially by food scientists and manufacturers as natural food preservatives due to their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. In this study, the effects of extracting solvents, namely, hexane, water, and acetone, individually or in combination with each other according to especial cubic mixture design, as extracting solvent were evaluated on antioxidant and antibacterial activities of Alhagi maurorum extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as main food pathogenic strains. Various empirical models were then offered in order to predict the antibacterial and antioxidant of extracts by extracting solvent composition, with quite high coefficients of determinations (R2> 84%). It has resulted that the extracting solvent composition had significant effects on biological and chemical characteristics of attained extracts. Due to the high antibacterial and antioxidant effects of extracts, they can be successfully used as natural food preservatives. Practical applications. The Alhagi maurorum extracts were fabricated using the best multicomponent extracting solvent system and the gained extract showed the greatest antioxidant or antibacterial activities, against common food pathogen strains. Thus, it can be successfully used in various food and beverage formulations as plant-based natural preserver and nutrition enhancer with health promoting activities. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15300					FSTA:2021-07-Cd1957

International Dairy Journal					Adding lactoferrin to milk at its natural pH before heating decreased the serum-phase kappa-casein and alpha-lactalbumin+beta-lactoglobulin. All lactoferrin was with the colloidal phase. Lactoferrin addition to milk before heating and acidification increased the gelation pH. The gels had lower stiffness, lower yield stress and higher yield strains as the level of lactoferrin increased. For pH adjusted milk, the levels of serum phase kappa-casein, alpha-lactalbumin+beta-lactoglobulin and lactoferrin increased with pH, but lower levels were observed at each pH as the level of lactoferrin increased. The stiffness of acid gels increased with increasing pH. At any pH, the stiffness of gels from samples with lactoferrin was lower than those from skim milk. The yield stresses for gels from milk with lactoferrin increased markedly with pH compared with those from skim milk. Lactoferrin addition and pH adjustment of milk before heating can be used to control serum protein levels and manipulate functional properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anema, S. G.							Spontaneous interaction between whey protein isolate proteins and lactoferrin: effect of heat denaturation.		International Dairy Journal					Native lactoferrin (U-Lf) forms predominantly soluble complexes with native (U-WPI) or denatured (H-WPI) whey protein isolate proteins at all mixing ratios, forming weakly turbid solutions and charge neutrality at a Lf to WPI ratio of 2.0, w/w. This may be due to an asymmetrical charge spacing between the two interacting protein species, resulting in a weak interaction and soluble complexes. Denatured lactoferrin (H-Lf) strongly interacts with U-WPI or H-WPI, with highly turbid solutions formed at certain ratios. For H-Lf/U-WPI, maximum turbidity and charge neutrality was observed at a ratio of 2.0, w/w, with turbidity decreasing and zeta potential increasing either side of this ratio. H-Lf/H-WPI formed highly turbid solutions and neutral complexes at a ratio of about 2.0, w/w; however, the solution remained highly turbid at higher ratios despite the increasing charges of the complexes. Denaturation may make the proteins less flexible allowing desolvation leading to precipitation rather than coacervation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Human health risk assessment through quantitative screening of insecticide residues in two green beans to ensure food safety.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Food contamination with pesticide residues is a serious concern, particularly in developing countries. The study analyzed samples of country bean (Lablab purpureus L.) and yard long bean (Vigna unguiculata L.) for residues of widely used insecticides to ensure food safety. We used a modified quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) extraction method followed by gas chromatography (GC)-flame thermionic detector (FTD) for quantitative estimation of pesticide residues. Mostly, the residues of chlorpyrifos, dimethoate and quinalphos were found in 11 and 14% of country bean and yard long bean samples, respectively. About 50% of the insecticide-contaminated bean samples contained residues above the maximum residue limit (MRL), which warrants a caution about the extensive and intensive use of pesticides in modern agriculture. The general claim of pesticide adulteration could contribute to the widespread occurrence of several insecticides in beans that threatens food safety. The assessment for chronic non-cancer health risk, based on estimated daily intake (EDI) and hazard quotient (HQ), suggests that the consumption of insecticide-contaminated beans poses potential threat to the health of adults (EDI: 2.79*10-4-2.96*10-4 and HQ: 0.56-0.59) as well as children (EDI: 9.79*10-4-1.77*10-3 and HQ: 1.96-3.55). Overall, our results clearly indicate that around 50% of insecticide-contaminated bean samples, available at various local markets in Bogura district of Bangladesh, may cause health risks in humans. The present observations might help the regulatory authorities concerned in setting new guidelines for the limits of pesticide residues in commonly used bean vegetables, and in monitoring the quality of commercial formulations.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Starch degradation with fruit ripening is closely related to the aging process and flavor formation in apples. In this study, ethylene, 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP), and apples treated at different temperatures were used to determine the key genes of starch-sugar metabolism during storage. Compared with 4°C storage, 20°C storage promoted starch degradation and sugar accumulation in apples. In addition, ethylene treatment promoted starch degradation and sugar accumulation in apples, while 1-MCP treatment showed the opposite effects. The expression of MdBams indicated the crucial role of MdBam5 in starch-sugar conversion. Transient overexpression of MdBam5 significantly reduced the starch content in apples. Furthermore, MdWRKY32 directly combined the MdBam5 promoter and activated the MdBam5 expression, which may promote the starch degradation in apples. Therefore, it was concluded that MdWRKY32 may be involved in the regulation of starch-sugar metabolism in postharvest apples by activating the MdBam5 expression.										2021	69	49	14906	14914	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c03343					FSTA:2022-04-Je4635

With observation and quarantine as the prevailing standard of care, this study evaluated the effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) in the biochemical markers of suspect and probable cases of COVID-19. A 28-day randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention was conducted among 63 adults in two isolation facilities in Santa Rosa City, Laguna, Philippines. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a standardized meal (control) or a standardized meal mixed with a predefined dosage of VCO. Changes in clinical markers were measured at three time points (day 0, 14, and 28), with daily monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. Participants in the intervention group showed a significant decline in the C-reactive protein level, with the mean CRP level normalized to≤5 mg/dL on the 14th day of the intervention.

Optimization of an untargeted DART-HRMS method envisaging identification of potential markers for saffron authenticity assessment.		Foods					Saffron is one of the most expensive agricultural products in the world and as such, the most commonly adulterated spice, with undeclared plant-based surrogates or synthetic components simulating color and morphology. Currently, saffron quality is certificated in the international trade market according to specific ISO guidelines, which test aroma, flavor, and color strength. However, it has been demonstrated that specific adulterants such as safflower, marigold, or turmeric up to 20% (w/w) cannot be detected under the prescribed approach; therefore, there is still a need for advanced and sensitive screening methods to cope with this open issue. The current investigation aims to develop a rapid and sensitive untargeted method based on an ambient mass spectrometry ionization source (DART) and an Orbitraphigh-resolution mass analyzer to discriminate pure and adulterated saffron samples with either safflower or turmeric. The metabolic profiles of pure and adulterated model samples prepared at different inclusion levels were acquired. Unsupervised multivariate analysis was carried out based on hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis as first confirmation of the discriminating potential of the metabolic profile acquired under optimized DART-HRMS conditions. In addition, a preliminary selection of potential markers for saffron authenticity was accomplished, identifying compounds able to discriminate the type of adulteration down to a concentration level of 5%. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study investigates the effect of a micronized lactose coating on the physical state of the fat and the reconstitution kinetics of whole milk powder at four different temperatures (4/21/40/60 °C) and two stirring rates (400/800 rpm). For this purpose, two types of micronized lactose were used as coating materials: crystalline and amorphous. At 4 °C and 21 °C, the coated powders sink and are reconstituted faster than pure whole milk powder, regardless of the stirring rate applied. At 40/60 °C and 400 rpm, although the amorphous micronized lactose coating leads to a significant decrease in the reconstitution time, the crystalline coating has the opposite effect (or no effect). This discrepancy is related to the large differences in terms of dissolution enthalpy between the two micronized lactose physical states. It is posited that the dissolution of the coating material causes a temperature shift at the powder-water interface which could hamper the complete melting of surface fat and influence its viscosity, thereby affecting wetting and sinking. These differences are overcome at a high stirring rate (800 rpm) or if agglomerated whole milk powder is used as the host material. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anglart, D.; Emanuelson, U.; Ronnegard, L.; Sandgren, C. H.							Detecting and predicting changes in milk homogeneity using data from automatic milking systems.		Journal of Dairy Science					To ensure milk quality and detect cows with signs of mastitis, visual inspection of milk by prestripping quarters before milking is recommended in many countries. An objective method to find milk changed in homogeneity (i.e., with clots) is to use commercially available inline filters to inspect the milk. Due to the required manual labor, this method is not applicable in automatic milking systems (AMS). We investigated the possibility of detecting and predicting changes in milk homogeneity using data generated by AMS. In total, 21,335 quarter-level milk inspections were performed on 5,424 milkings of 624 unique cows on 4 farms by applying visual inspection of inline filters that assembled clots from the separate quarters during milking. Images of the filters with clots were scored for density, resulting in 892 observations with signs of clots for analysis (77% traces or mild cases, 15% moderate cases, and 8% heavy cases). The quarter density scores were combined into 1 score indicating the presence of clots during a single cow milking and into 2 scores summarizing the density scores in cow milkings during a 30-h sampling period. Data generated from the AMS, such as milk yield, milk flow, conductivity, and online somatic cell counts, were used as input to 4 multilayer perceptron models to detect or predict single milkings with clots and to detect milking periods with clots. All models resulted in high specificity (98-100%), showing that the models correctly classified cow milkings or cow milking periods with no clots observed. The ability to successfully classify cow milkings or cow periods with observed clots had a low sensitivity. The highest sensitivity (26%) was obtained by the model that detected clots in a single milking. The prevalence of clots in the data was low (2.4%), which was reflected in the results. The positive predictive value depends on the prevalence and was relatively high, with the highest positive predictive value (72%) reached in the model that detected clots during the 30-h sampling periods. The misclassification rate for cow milkings that included higher-density scores was lower, indicating that the models that detected or predicted clots in a single milking could better distinguish the heavier cases of clots. Using data from AMS to detect and predict changes in milk homogeneity seems to be possible, although the prediction performance for the definitions of clots used in this study was poor.

Organic dragon fruits (Hylocereus undatus and Hylocereus polyrhizus) grown at the same edaphoclimatic conditions: comparison of phenolic and organic acids profiles and antioxidant activities.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to characterize and compare pulps of two species of organic dragon fruits, Hylocereus undatus and Hylocereus polyrhizus, grown at the same edaphoclimatic conditions in terms of bioactive compounds and physicochemical aspects. No significant differences were observed between purple and white pulps concerning moisture, ascorbic acid concentration, and DPPH-assay antioxidant activity. Purple pulp demonstrated higher values for pH, Folin-Ciocalteau reducing capacity, and FRAP-assay antioxidant activity, lower acidity, and expressive total betalain content, suggesting higher bioactive potential. The main phenolic compounds identified in purple pulp were rutin, hesperidin, ferulic, and sinapic acids, while the white one was rich in chlorogenic acid. The major organic acids identified in both pulps were malic, citric, formic, pipecolic, and ascorbic. Pipecolic acid was detected in both, although more predominant in purple pulp, in remarkable concentrations, being the first report of it in the Cactaceae family. The found results indicate potential bioactivity, contributing to confirm the status of superfruit of these exotic fruits. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Anh Do Quynh Nguyen; Ashokkumar Sekar; Myoungjin Kim; Loc Nguyen; Nga Le; Sangjun Uh; Sukil Hong; Keun Kim							Fish sauce fermentation using Marinococcus halotolerans SPQ isolate as a starter culture.		Food Science & Nutrition					A total of 344 halophilic bacteria were isolated from fish fermentation broths, solar salt crystals, seawater, and muds from ponds of salt pans in Vietnam and subjected to aroma evaluation using fish broth containing 29 ~ 30% (w/v) NaCl. One isolate from a salt crystal with the highest aroma score was selected, identified by using 16S rDNA sequence, and named Marinococcus halotolerans SPQ. The GC-MS results of the fish broth fermented by M. halotolerans SPQ revealed elevated concentrations of several aroma compounds such as ethyl alcohol, 1-propanol, 1-butyl alcohol, 1-amyl alcohol, and methionol. During the validation tests for M. halotolerans SPQ, using 2 kg of anchovy fish in 30% (w/v) NaCl at pH 5.78, the total and amino nitrogen values in the broth increased over time from 15.2 g/L at the beginning to 26.3 g/L at 6th month, with these values being comparable to those of the control. The ammoniacal nitrogen value (2.52 g/L) in the inoculated broth at 6th month was slightly higher than that (2.21 g/L) of control. The histamine content of the fish broth inoculated with M. halotolerans SPQ after 6 months was 110.12 mg/L, less than the maximum permitted safety limit of 200 mg/L, indicating it to be safe. Physical parameters, such as the total, amino, ammoniacal nitrogens, and histamine content of fish broth fermented by M. halotolerans MPQ met the standards for Vietnamese fish sauces. Two important umami amino acids, aspartic and glutamic acid, were seen to significantly increase, by 23.5% and 35.1%, respectively, even in the extremely harsh fermentation conditions posed by 30% (w/v) NaCl. The color, odor, and taste of the fish sauce fermented by M. halotolerans SPQ elicited the highest preference score accorded by the panelists. Taken together, M. halotolerans SPQ is a promising starter culture strain for fish sauce fermentation. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Anh Thi Hong Bui; Cozzolino, D.; Zisu, B.; Jayani Chandrapala							Infrared analysis of ultrasound treated milk systems with different levels of caseins, whey proteins and fat.		International Dairy Journal					Low-frequency ultrasound (20 kHz) was applied to model casein (CF) and whey protein (WF) milk systems with varying fat contents of 2%, 4%, and 6% (w/w) under different energy densities from 9.54 to 190.8 J mL-1. The study used Fourier transform mid-infrared spectrometry (FT-MIR) to analyse the modification of milk proteins and fat. The results showed that the fat content and sonication time influenced the intensities of fatty chains and ester groups which are assigned to triacylglycerols and lipid-protein complexes for both CF and WF systems. Acoustic cavitation induced structural changes of proteins due to denaturation/aggregation and disruption of milk fat globules/fat clusters led to new protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions.

J		Anh Thi Hong Bui; Cozzolino, D.; Zisu, B.; Jayani Chandrapala							The production of volatile compounds in model casein systems with varying fat levels as affected by low-frequency ultrasound.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effects of low-frequency ultrasound on the production of volatile compounds in model casein protein systems containing various fat concentrations of 2%, 4% and 6% (w/w) were investigated. Ultrasound application was performed at 20 kHz for up to 10 min which corresponded to energy densities ranging from 9.54 to 190.8 J mL-1. Similar volatile compounds were detected both in pure fat and mixtures of casein and fat (CF) systems. These volatiles belonged to the groups of aldehydes, ketones, esters, alcohols and hydrocarbons, which were the products of oxidation of lipids or protein degradation due to acoustic cavitation. The amount of fat in the casein systems had minor effects on the production of volatiles, whereas the production of volatile compounds was significantly affected by the ultrasound treatment. Short sonication times <5 min generated similar volatile profiles to the untreated samples. In contrast, prolonged sonication for 5 and 10 min considerably increased the production of volatile compounds and the amounts of fatty acids. Thus, the application of low-frequency ultrasound for short periods should be considered to minimise the production of volatile compounds which can ultimately affect the taste. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	8	3948	3959	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15012					FSTA:2021-11-Pa6107
J		Anh Thi Hong Bui; Cozzolino, D.; Zisu, B.; Jayani Chandrapala							The generation of volatiles in model systems containing varying casein to whey protein ratios as affected by low frequency ultrasound.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The application of low frequency ultrasound has been intensively explored within the dairy field to improve product properties and processing efficiency over conventional treatments. However, the generation of undesirable volatile compounds during sonication can negatively influence the uptake of this technique within the dairy industry. Therefore, the present study was attempted to investigate the formation of volatile compounds in model milk systems containing 4% w/w fat and 3.5% w/w milk proteins with varying ratios of casein to whey proteins (50:50, 60:40, 80:20) as affected by low frequency ultrasound (20 kHz). The samples were treated for 1 and 10 min which were corresponding to energy densities of 9.54 J ml-1 and 190.8 J ml-1, respectively. The generation of volatile compounds was mainly influenced by the sonication time for all milk samples irrespective of the casein to whey ratios. The fatty acid chains and ester groups of milk fat and lipid-protein complexes increased with the increase in sonication time for all samples regardless of the casein to whey ratios. In contrast, milk proteins altered their secondary structure with an increase in random coil structure and concomitant decrease of alpha-helix, beta-turn and beta-sheet as affected both by sonication time and casein to whey ratios.

Bacterial diversity of smoked and smoked-dried fish from West Africa: a metagenomic approach.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to explore the bacterial diversity of smoked fish and smoked-dried fish. Forty-eight fish samples were collected from various processing sites and markets in Benin. The bacterial diversity was analyzed using high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina MiSeq platform. In total, 16 bacterial phyla were identified across all samples, with the majority of sequences belonging to Firmicutes (43.3%) and Proteobacteria (43.6%). Families, Staphylococcaceae, Moraxellaceae, Planococcaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, and Bartonellaceae, were well represented. A total of 384 distinct genera was identified, with the most abundant represented by the Gram-negative, Acinetobacter, Bartonella, Enterobacter, Morganella, and Photobacterium, and the Gram-positive, Aerococcus, Bacillus, Kurthia, Macrococcus, Staphylococcus, and Weissella. OTUs related to pathogenic bacteria, such as Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Listeria monocytogenes, were not detected in these popular foods sold in street markets in Benin. However, the presence of potentially harmful histamine-producing bacteria has been revealed. Practical application. In West Africa, fish is mainly preserved by hot smoking, which can be followed by an additional drying step using the heat that emanates from the kiln. Although several studies have investigated the microbiological quality of smoked and smoked-dried fish, their overall microbial diversity has remained so far poorly explored. Therefore, this study has investigated the bacterial diversity of these popular foods. The results of this work provide useful information on bacteria potentially participating in food spoilage or compromising the safety of these popular foods and can be useful for improving their quality and safety. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Optimisation and comparison of orthogonal methods for separation and characterisation of extracellular vesicles to investigate how representative infant milk formula is of milk.		Food Chemistry					Many infants are fed infant milk formula (IMF). However, IMF production from skim milk (SM) involves harsh treatment. So, we hypothesised that the quantity and/or quality of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in IMF may be reduced. Thus, firstly, we aimed to optimise separation of EVs from IMF and SM and, secondly, we aimed to compare the EV isolates from these two sources. Prior to EV isolation, abundant casein micelles of similar sizes to EVs were removed by treating milk samples with either acetic acid or hydrochloric acid. Samples progressed to differential ultracentrifugation (DUC) or gradient ultracentrifugation (GUC). EV characterisation included BCA, SDS-PAGE, nanoparticle tracking (NTA), electron microscopy (TEM), immunoblotting, and imaging flow cytometry (IFCM). Reduced EV concentrations were found in IMF. SM-derived EVs were intact, while IMF contained disrupted EV-like structures. EV biomarkers were more abundant with isolates from SM, indicating EV proteins in IMF are compromised. Altogether, a suitable method combining acid pre-treatment with GUC for EV separation from milk products was developed. EVs appear to be substantially compromised in IMF compared to SM.

J		Anisur Rahman; Shuai Wang; Jinshan Yan; Huirong Xu							Intact macadamia nut quality assessment using near-infrared spectroscopy and multivariate analysis.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					As production and demand for high quality Macadamia nuts rise worldwide, rapid and accurate in-situ methods for monitoring internal nut quality will need to be developed. Therefore, purpose of this study was to determine the quality (internal nut defects and oil content) of intact macadamia nuts by combining near-infrared spectroscopy with variable selection algorithms and calibration models. Transmission spectra in the ranges of 1,000-1,650 nm from a total of 345 macadamia nuts were acquired. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and partial least square-regression (PLS-R) models with three different spectral preprocessing techniques were then evaluated using the full spectra to classify nut defects and predict oil content. A Savitzky-Golay (SG) first derivatives preprocessing technique was selected as the best one. Then, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), random frog (RF), and variable importance projection (VIP) algorithms were used to select effective wavelengths (EWs) to build simpler and more robust models for classification of intact macadamia nut defects and prediction of oil content. The PLS-DA-CARS with SG first derivatives preprocessing based model provided the best nut defect classification with a 91.4% accuracy, whilst a PLS-R-CARS with SG second derivatives preprocessing model for oil content prediction had a coefficient of determination (R2pred) of 0.88 and standard error of prediction (SEP) of 1.15%.

J		Anita M. Chappalwar; Vikas Pathak; Meena Goswami; Kumar Verma, A.; Vincent Rajkumar							Efficacy of lemon albedo as fat replacer for development of ultra-low-fat chicken patties.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The study was carried out to develop ultra-low-fat chicken patties with incorporation of lemon albedo powder. Chicken patties were developed by incorporating lemon albedo powder as fat replacer at 1.0, 2.05, 3.0% level to replace 50% vegetable oil in formulation. Emulsion and product pH, emulsion stability, fat and cholesterol decreased significantly (p< 0.05), however cooking yield, moisture content, fat retention and moisture retention values increased significantly (p< 0.05) in treatments. All mineral and textural parameters decreased significantly (p< 0.05) except manganese content. Lightness (L*) values increased significantly (p< 0.05) with no significant effect on yellowness (b*) and redness (a*) values. All sensory scores decreased significantly (p< 0.05) except saltiness scores with incorporation of lemon albedo, however there was no significant difference in overall acceptability scores between control and 1% lemon albedo powder. It was concluded that lemon albedo at 1.0% level could be used as an effective fat replacer for development of ultra-low-fat chicken patties. Practical applications. Chicken patty exhibits industrial and economic importance, which is mainly affected by the raw material quality and composition. Patties containing less than 20 g/100 g fat content usually exhibit rubbery texture therefore, higher fat content is necessary to prepare patty without affecting its quality, however product with high fat content may exerts harmful effect on the human health such as obesity and high blood cholesterol levels. Citrus albedo is main by-product of citrus industry which has great potential to be used as fat replacer in meat products along with various antioxidant, medicinal and functional properties. Incorporation of lemon albedo as fat replacer may enhance product's nutritional quality as well as functional properties. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15587					FSTA:2021-11-Sn6496

Performance evaluation of ultra violet assisted vertical re-circulating depuration system on microbial, heavy metal reduction and composition of black clam (Villorita cyprinoides).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A cost-effective, portable, ultra violet assisted vertical re-circulatory depuration system (UVDC) was developed and its effect on microbiological, heavy metal and proximate composition of Black clam (Villorita cyprinoides) was investigated. The process of depuration was found to be effective in reduction of total viable count by 1.8 log cfu g-1. Escherichia coli were within the permissible limit and both Vibrio cholera and V. parahaemolyticus were absent. The concentrations of heavy metals (Cd, Pb and Cu) were found to decrease by 40.44%, 96.51% and 34.50% respectively at the end of 48 h of depuration in UVDC. Significant reduction in protein, lipid, ash and glycogen contents were observed after the depuration process. The portability and easy to assemble nature of the system further improves its applicability as an onsite depuration unit which could be effectively utilized by the small-scale clam fishers/farmers depending on polluted waters for enhancing their income and livelihood.

Foods					This study involves information about the concentrations of nutrients (proteins, phenolic compounds, free amino acids, minerals (Ca, P, and Iron), hardness) in milled rice processed with enzymes; xylanase and cellulase produced by Aspergillus awamori, MTCC 9166 and Trichoderma reese, MTCC164. Brown rice was processed with 60-100% enzyme (40mL buffer-undiluted) for 30 to 150 min at 30°C to 50°C followed by polishing for 20-100 s at a safe moisture level. Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) models were used for process optimization of enzymes. The MLR correlation coefficient (R2) varied between 0.87-0.90, and the sum of square (SSE) was placed within 0.008-8.25. While the ANN R2 (correlation coefficient) varied between 0.97 and 0.9999 (1), MSE changed from 0.005 to 6.13 representing that the ANN method has better execution across MLR. The optimized cellulase process parameters (87.2% concentration, 80.1 min process time, 33.95°C temperature and 21.8 s milling time) and xylanase process parameters (85.7% enzyme crude, 77.1 min process time, 35°C temperature and 20 s) facilitated the increase of Ca (70%), P (64%), Iron (17%), free amino acids (34%), phenolic compounds (78%) and protein (84%) and decreased hardness (20%) in milled rice. Scanning electron micrographs showed an increased rupture attributing to enzymes action on milled rice. © 2021 by the authors.

Acacia mearnsii gum: a residue as an alternative gum Arabic for food stabilizer.		Food Chemistry					Acacia mearnsii gum is not commercially exploited, being characterized as residue from A. mearnsii cultivation. This work investigated the A. mearnsii gum polysaccharide composition, its cytotoxicity and the technological effect as a stabilizer in ice cream. A. mearnsii gum showed a similar chemical structure to commercial gum Arabic and did not decrease the viability and proliferation of fibroblast cells (Balb/3T3) and hepatocarcinoma (HepG2). Rheological tests showed that the ice cream stabilized by the A. mearnsii gum had a more structured system (more interactions between the mixture components) and the same melting characteristics as the ice cream samples made with commercial gum Arabic. The results showed that A. mearnsii gum, which is actually an agro-industrial residue from tannin production for industry, is a potential stabilizing gum for the food industry, contributing to the economic development of the exploitation chain of A. mearnsii products and by-products.

Multivariate optimization of an ultrasound-assisted extraction method of bioactive phenolic compounds in malagueta peppers (Capsicum frutescens).		Food Analytical Methods					The use of statistical tools in the optimization of bioactive extraction processes increases efficiency and reduces process costs, indicating the optimal conditions for obtaining the best results. The objective of this work was to optimize an ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure and to quantify phenolic compounds in Capsicum frutescens samples. In the optimization of the extraction solution, simplex-centroid mixture design for the proportions optimization of the extractor components (water, methanol, and ethanol) was used. A two-level factorial design (23) was used for the preliminary evaluation of the factors that influenced the extraction process; before this step, a Box-Behnken design was carried out to optimize the factors of solvent volume, sonication time, and temperature with the desirability function as a response. The best mixture composition was 95% methanol and 5% water and the best experimental conditions for the process variables were 16 mL, 15 min, and 55°C. Applying the method to pepper samples, twelve compounds were determined by HPLC-DAD. The relative standard deviations (RSD) found for all analytes were lower than 3.0%. The accuracy was evaluated using addition/recovery test with recoveries between 81 and 95%. The Box-Behnken and mixture designs are efficient tools for optimizing the analytical method using ultrasound to extract phenolic compounds from C. frutescens. The procedure was applied for extraction phenolics compounds in three papers samples and the concentrations found were trans-cinnamic acid (-1), gallic acid (0.94-1.56mg g-1), quercetin (-1), syringic acid (-1), ellagic acid (2.2-3.1mg g-1), catechin (1.7-3.24mg g-1), ferulic acid (-1), p-coumaric acid (57-67 g g-1), chlorogenic acid (0.12-0.20mg g-1), caffeic acid (0.090-0.12mg g-1), vanillic acid (1.1-2.7mg g-1), and kaempferol (-1). ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	12	2607	2616	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02088-z					FSTA:2022-07-Te2731

Influence of drying temperature on quality attributes of bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.): drying kinetics and modeling, rehydration, color, and antioxidant analysis.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This study was focused on the effect of hot air drying temperatures (40, 50, and 60 °C) on rehydration (25 °C) behavior and quality attributes of green (G), red (R), and yellow (Y) color bell peppers (BP). Increase in drying temperature significantly (p<0.05) improved the drying rate and the moisture diffusivity of BP. Drying temperature increased the rehydration-ratio and higher rehydration was observed for freeze-dried samples (-50 °C). Two-term exponential and first-order kinetics models were found the most appropriate to explain the drying and rehydration kinetics, respectively. The variation in color parameters was correlated with the significant (p<0.05) deviation in total chlorophylls (20.53-16.88mug/g dry-mass), red pigment (493.02-766.25mug/g dry-mass), and nonsignificant deviation in yellow pigment (203.6-202.77mug/g dry-mass) of respective BP during drying. Increasing drying temperature increased the phenolic and flavonoid contents, but decreased the free-radical scavenging activity of the BP. Practical Application. This study will add scientific data on comparative analysis of drying of red, yellow and green bell pepper with respect to different drying temperatures. Study will help to identify the best drying condition with respect to desired quality and color of bell pepper. Dried sample can be used in curry making, ready to eat products or seasoning without any seasonal barrier. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13880					FSTA:2022-03-Jq2977

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present study reports the effect of enzymatic debranching and heating-cooling treatment on morphology, crystallinity and thermal properties of resistant starch preparations from Solanum tuberosum, variety Kufri Bahar. Further, the proliferative and protective effect of resistant starch on viability of probiotic cultures in fermented milk during storage at refrigeration was also investigated. The results indicated that enzymatic treatment resulted in more crystalline form of resistant starch granules with an increased thermal stability. A strain specific prebiotic activity of potato resistant starch was observed with a higher proliferative activity towards Lactobacillus paracasei CD4 among the tested probiotic strains. In synbiotic fermented milk preparation, the supplementation of enzymatic treated resistant starch increased the viability of L. paracasei CD4 under refrigeration up to 14 days as compared to control (p < 0.05).

J		Ankita Mishra; Ashok Kumar							Mapping B-cell epitopes for nonspecific lipid transfer proteins of legumes consumed in India and identification of critical residues responsible for IgE binding.		Foods					Nonspecific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) have been categorized as panallergens and display widespread occurrence across plant-kingdom. Present study, investigated B-cell epitopes for LTPs from chickpea, mung-bean, cowpea, pigeon-pea, and soybean via in silico methods. In-silico predicted regions were evaluated for epitope-conservancy and property-based peptide similarity search by different allergen databases. Additionally, the in-silico predicted regions were compared with the experimentally validated epitopes of peach-LTP. Sequence-homology studies showed that chickpea and mung-bean LTPs shared significant homology, i.e., >70% and >60%, respectively, with other LTP allergens from lentil, garden-pea, peanut, etc. Phylogenetic-analysis also showed chickpea and mung-bean LTPs to be closely related to allergenic LTPs from lentil and peanut, respectively. Epitope-conservation analysis showed that two of the predicted B-cell epitopic regions in chickpea and mung-bean LTPs were also conserved in other allergenic LTPs from peach, peanut, garden-pea, lentil, and green-bean, and might serve as conserved B-cell epitopes of the LTP protein family. Property-distance index values for chickpea and mung-bean LTPs also showed that most of the epitopes shared similarity with the reported allergens like-lentil, peanut, apple, plum, tomato, etc. Present findings, may be explored for identification of probable allergenicity of novel LTPs, on the basis of the reported conserved B-cell epitopes, responsible for potential cross-reactivity. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ankita Sharma; Kr Anand, S.; Neha Singh; Akshay Dwarkanath; Nath Dwivedi, U.; Poonam Kakkar							Berbamine induced activation of the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling axis attenuates the development of hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-induced NAFLD rats.		Food & Function					Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a chronic metabolic disorder is concomitant with oxidative stress and inflammation. This study aimed to assess the effects of berbamine (BBM), a natural bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloid with manifold biological activities and pharmacological effects on lipid, cholesterol and glucose metabolism in a rat model of NAFLD, and to explicate the potential mechanisms underlying its activity. BBM administration alleviated the increase in the body weight and liver index of HFD rats. The aberrations in liver function, serum parameters, and microscopic changes in the liver structure of HFD fed rats were significantly improved upon BBM administration. BBM also significantly attenuated oxidative damage and inhibited triglyceride and cholesterol synthesis. The SIRT1 deacetylase activity was also enhanced by BBM through liver kinase B1 and activated AMP-activated protein kinase. Activation of the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway prevented the downstream target ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and elevation in the expression of FAS (fatty acid synthase) and SCD1 (steroyl CoA desaturase). BBM also modulated the expression of PPARs maintaining the fatty acid homeostasis regulation. The assessment of berbamine induced ultrastructural changes by TEM analysis and the expression of autophagic markers LC3a/b, Beclin 1 and p62 revealed the induction of autophagy to alleviate fatty liver conditions. These results show novel findings that BBM induced protection against hepatic lipid metabolic disorders is achieved by regulating the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK pathway, and thus it emerges as an effective phyoconstituent for the management of NAFLD. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	2	892	909	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02501a					FSTA:2021-06-Aj8470
J		Anku Das; Nath Bora, B.; Hemanta Chutia; Lata Mahanta, C.							Processing of minerals and anthocyanins-rich mixed-fruit leather from banana (Musa acuminata) and sohiong (Prunus nepalensis).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					A mixed-fruit leather of banana and sohiong (Prunus nepalensis) fruits using optimized conditions was prepared. Central composite design was conducted to optimize the concentration of the independent variables, viz. sohiong, citric acid, and pectin taking anthocyanin content and DPPH scavenging activity as the responses and keeping the concentration of banana (70 g) and sugar (10 g) constant. The optimized leather contained 0.9 g of citric acid, 0.9 g of pectin, and 28.04 g of sohiong and recorded anthocyanins content of 5.53 mg cyanidin-3-glucoside/100 g and 91.3% DPPH scavenging activity. The content of ascorbic acid, potassium, and magnesium in 100 g of the optimized leather was 200,649.8, and 104.88 mg, respectively. Modified Page model gave the best fit for drying behavior of leather. Addition of maltodextrin improved the textural properties of gumminess and chewiness of the leather samples. The leather with 1.5% maltodextrin was judged the best for sensory attributes. Novelty impact statement. About 75% of banana suffer post-harvest loss and there is a need to develop a healthy snack utilizing banana which is rich in potassium and fiber. Sohiong Is a minor fruit that is very rich in anthocyanins. The leather incorporating banana and sohiong was developed using optimized conditions for maximum anthocyanin content and DPPH radical scavenging activity. The study results revealed the scope for developing mineral and anthocyanin-rich mixed fruit leather. Textural and sensory evaluation results indicate that the mixed fruit leather can be promoted as a healthy snack. Processing bananas into leather will also help to reduce post-harvest loss of banana. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15718					FSTA:2022-01-Jg0171
J		Ankur Gupta; Biplab Das; Agnimitra Biswas							Performance analysis of stand-alone solar photovoltaic thermal dryer for drying of green chili in hot-humid weather conditions of North-East India.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					In the present study, an innovative stand-alone solar photovoltaic thermal (PVT) dryer has been designed and tested in hot-humid weather conditions of North-East India for drying green chili. The electrical output of the hybrid PVT solar dryer has been utilized to operate the blower for the dryer making the system self-sustained. A comparative analysis of the drying phenomena under the open sun and in the PVT based dryer is performed. Mathematical modeling is also done to investigate the drying kinetics of green chili for both drying conditions. Results. Indicate that the moisture content of 0.030 (d.b.) in the solar dryer and 0.035 (d.b.) in the open sun has been reduced for a span of 21 and 37hr, respectively. Hybrid PVT solar dryer has achieved an average thermal efficiency of 31.37% and an average specific moisture extraction rate of 0.228kg/kWh. The overall energy consumption for drying green chili is calculated to be 4.90kWh/kg. Also, the overall thermal efficiency of 64.16%, thermal efficiency of 30.15%, and average electrical efficiency of 12.92% are secured. The results demonstrate the improved performance of the present PVT dryer for green chili drying in comparison to some of the conventional direct/indirect solar dryers. Practical Applications. The present PVT solar dryer system can be utilized for drying the products using thermal energy produced by PVT air collector as well as generating electrical power in the decentralized off-grid areas. Solar drying is not adequately popular in the North-Eastern part of India due to the unavailability of solar drying systems for farmers. The agricultural products can be dried in the farming areas by installing this system. This PVT solar dryer provides a solution to the farmers for drying at zero energy cost and can be used as a source of income generation. This PVT solar drying system can be used to increase the storage life and reduce the spoilage and deterioration of agricultural commodities. Energy efficient solar drying process, high-quality products, and faster drying rate compared to traditional drying method can be achieved with the help of using this system. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	6			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13701					FSTA:2021-10-Te3588
J		Ankush Giri, N.; Kashiram Sakhale, B.							Effects of incorporation of orange-fleshed sweet potato flour on physicochemical, nutritional, functional, microbial, and sensory characteristics of gluten-free cookies.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Cookies were formulated with orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) flour, amaranth flour (AF), and cassava starch powder (CSP) in the ratio of 0:50:50 (control), 40:30:30 (T1), 50:25:25 (T2), 60:20:20 (T3), 70:15:15 (T4), 80:10:10 (T5), 90:05:05 (T6), and 100:0:0 (T7), respectively. The cookies were prepared and evaluated for physicochemical, nutritional, and sensory characteristics. Significant decrease in water absorption, oil absorption, increase in spread ratio, spread factor, and hardness of gluten-free (GF) cookies with an increase in the incorporation of OFSP flour. The dough stability, consistency, and farinograph quality number were increase. The OFSP cookies were superior to control for bioactive components and antioxidant activity. The cookies containing 70% OFSP flour with 15% AF and CSP found organoleptically acceptable and safe for 90 days of storage period. Practical applications. The orange-fleshed sweet potato tubers are rich in health benefit components such as beta-carotene, phenolic acids, carbohydrates, fibers, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, potassium, zinc, calcium, iron, and vitamins A content. The potential of orange-fleshed sweet potato flour was utilized for the development of gluten-free (GF) cookies enriched in carotenoids content. The in-depth study of various functional, nutritional, and rheological properties of orange-fleshed sweet potato flour with amaranth flour and cassava starch powder represents its suitability for the preparation of functional GF cookies enriched in micronutrients. The additional benefits of combinations of these ingredients in GF cookies can be used for celiac patients, fasting purpose, and to combat the deficiency of vitamin A. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15324					FSTA:2021-08-Mq4616
J		Anli Wang; Xinyu Chen; Shanyun Wu; Wei Jia; Jingjing Jiao; Yu Zhang							Unraveling the serum metabolomic profile of acrylamide-induced cardiovascular toxicity.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Acrylamide has been reported as an important dietary risk factor from carbohydrate-rich processing food. However, systemic biological effects on the serum metabolomics induced by acrylamide have poorly been understood. In the present study, we evaluated the metabolic profiles in a rat serum after exposure to acrylamide using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography combined with quadrupole-orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry. The serum biochemical parameters of the treated and control groups were also determined using an automatic biochemical analyzer. Compared with the control group, 10 metabolites were significantly upregulated, including citric acid, D-(-)-fructose, gluconic acid, L-ascorbic acid 2-sulfate, 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, valine, L-phenylalanine, prolylleucine, succinic acid, and cholic acid, while 5 metabolites were significantly downregulated, including 3-hydroxybutyric acid, 4-oxoproline, 2,6-xylidine, 4-phenyl-3-buten-2-one, and N-ethyl-N-methylcathinone in the serum of 4-week-old rats exposed to acrylamide in the high-dose group (all P< 0.05). Importantly, acrylamide exposure affected metabolites mainly involved in the citrate cycle, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosyntheses, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosyntheses, and pyruvate metabolism. These results suggested that exposure to acrylamide in rats exhibited marked systemic metabolic changes and affected the cardiovascular system. This study will provide a theoretical basis for exploring the toxic mechanism and will contribute to the diagnosis and prevention of acrylamide-induced cardiovascular toxicity.										2021	69	40	12012	12020	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c04367					FSTA:2022-02-Cf0428
J		Annu Mehta; Chetan Sharma; Madhuri Kanala; Mishika Thakur; Harrison, R.; Torrico, D. D.							Self-reported emotions and facial expressions on consumer acceptability: a study using energy drinks.		Foods					Emotional responses elicited by foods are of great interest for new product developers and marketing professionals, as consumer acceptance proved to be linked to the emotions generated by the product in the consumers. An emotional measurement is generally considered an appropriate tool to differentiate between the products of similar nutritional value, flavour, liking and packaging. Novel methods used to measure emotions include self-reporting verbal and visual measurements, and facial expression techniques. This study aimed to evaluate the explicit and implicit emotional response elicited during the tasting of two different brands (A and B) of energy drinks. The explicit response of consumers was assessed using liking (nine-point hedonic scale), and emotions (EsSense Profile-Check-All-That-Apply questionnaire), and implicit emotional responses were evaluated by studying facial expressions using the Affectiva Affdex software. The familiarity of the product and purchase intent were also assessed during the study. The hedonic rating shows a significant difference in liking between the two brands of energy drink during the tasting session. For the explicit emotional responses, participants elicited more positive emotions than the negative emotions for both energy drinks. However, participants expressed "happy", "active" and "eager" emotions more frequently for energy drink A. On the other hand, the implicit emotional responses through facial expressions indicated a high level of involvement of the participants with energy drink B as compared to energy drink A. The study showed that overall liking and the explicit and implicit emotional measurements are weakly to moderately correlated. © 2021 by the authors.

Determination of aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A and zearalenone in organic wheat flour under different storage conditions.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Samples of flour derived from an organic wheat seed cultivated in the region Abruzzo (Central Italy) were examined for the detection of aflatoxins, deoxynivalenol, ochratoxin A and zearalenone after storage in the presence of oxygen or under vacuum, for one year. They were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection for aflatoxins, ochratoxin A and zearalenone and with diode array detector for deoxynivalenol. An immunoaffinity column clean-up was applied for all the compounds, except for aflatoxin determination, which required a solid-phase extraction. Recoveries (range: 76-107%) and within-laboratory reproducibility (RSD% < 10.3) met the performance criteria of Commission Regulation (EU) No. 519/2014 amending Commission Regulation (EC) No. 401/2006 for the detection of mycotoxins in foodstuffs. Analytes were below the detection limit of the method, and this result was probably due to the quality of organic seed and good agricultural practices performed for the prevention of mycotoxin formation. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Annvi Dhaka; Mehanathan Muthamilarasan; Manoj Prasad							A comprehensive study on core enzymes involved in starch metabolism in the model nutricereal, foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.).		Journal of Cereal Science					Starch biosynthesis is an important process in plants as starch serves as a source of carbon and energy. In cereals, starch is the predominant constituent of the grains that provide carbohydrates in food and feed. Given its importance, the biosynthesis and accumulation of starch have been well studied in major cereals. However, in millets, no such study provides insights into the starch biosynthesis and diversity of enzymes involved in this process. In foxtail millet (Setaria italica), we have identified and characterized six classes of enzyme-encoding genes involved in starch metabolism, viz., ADP glucose phosphorylase, starch synthase, starch branching enzyme, starch debranching enzyme, phosphorylase, and disproportionating enzyme. Analysis of gene structure, chromosomal localization, phylogenetic analysis, and study of domain composition were performed to gain insights into the structure and organization of these gene families. Further, expression profiling of these genes in two cultivars contrastingly differing in grain amylose content was performed at different seed development stages. The expression data showed spatiotemporally divergent expression patterns of the genes and pinpointed several candidate genes that could be targeted for further functional characterization to study the starch metabolism in millets as well as to improve starch content through genomics approaches.

EFSA Journal					Following an application from Sensus B. V. (Royal Cosun), submitted for authorisation of a health claim pursuant to Article 13 (5) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006 via the Competent Authority of the Netherlands, the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies (NDA) was asked to deliver an opinion on the scientific substantiation of a health claim related to Frutalose and maintenance of normal defecation. The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence. The Panel considers that Frutalose, a mixture of fructans obtained from enzymatic hydrolysis of chicory inulin, is sufficiently characterised. The claimed effect proposed by the applicant is "contributes to regular bowel function by increasing stool frequency". The proposed target population is "the general healthy adult population". Maintenance of normal defecation is a beneficial physiological effect provided that it does not result in diarrhoea. One human intervention study showed an effect of Frutalose on the maintenance of normal defecation by increasing stool frequency and improving stool consistency (softer stools) when consumed daily at a dose of 15 g for 8 weeks. The results have not been replicated in other studies. There is a plausible mechanism by which Frutalose could exert the claimed effect. The Panel concludes that the evidence provided is insufficient to establish a cause and effect relationship between the consumption of Frutalose and maintenance of normal defecation under the proposed conditions of use. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

The scope of the application was proposed to fall under a health claim based on newly developed scientific evidence. MegaNatural-BP, a grape seed extract standardised for total phenolics, gallic acid and the catechin and epicatechin content, is sufficiently characterised. The proposed claimed effect, maintenance of normal blood pressure (BP), is a beneficial physiological effect. Among the two human intervention studies provided from which conclusions could be drawn, one showed an effect of MegaNatural-BP (300 mg/day) on BP in adults with normal and high normal BP when consumed daily for 6 weeks, whereas the second study did not show an effect of MegaNatural-BP at the same daily dose consumed for 8 weeks in adults with normal and high normal blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension. The evidence provided did not establish a plausible mechanism by which the food could exert the claimed effect in vivo in humans.

European Food Safety Authority; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control				The European Union Summary Report on Antimicrobial Resistance in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food in 2018/2019.		EFSA Journal					Data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in zoonotic and indicator bacteria from humans, animals and food are collected annually by the EU Member States (MSs), jointly analysed by the EFSA and the ECDC and reported in a yearly EU Summary Report. The annual monitoring of AMR in animals and food within the EU is targeted at selected animal species corresponding to the reporting year. The 2018 monitoring specifically focussed on poultry and their derived carcases/meat, while the monitoring performed in 2019 specifically focused on pigs and calves under 1 year of age, as well as their derived carcases/meat. Monitoring and reporting of AMR in 2018/2019 included data regarding Salmonella, Campylobacter and indicator Escherichia coli isolates, as well as data obtained from the specific monitoring of presumptive ESBL-/AmpC-/carbapenemase-producing E. coli isolates. Additionally, some MSs reported voluntary data on the occurrence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in animals and food, with some countries also providing data on antimicrobial susceptibility. This report provides an overview of the main findings of the 2018/2019 harmonised AMR monitoring in the main food-producing animal populations monitored, in related carcase/meat samples and in humans. Where available, data monitoring obtained from pigs, calves, broilers, laying hens and turkeys, as well as from carcase/meat samples and humans were combined and compared at the EU level, with particular emphasis on multidrug resistance, complete susceptibility and combined resistance patterns to critically important antimicrobials, as well as Salmonella and E. coli isolates possessing ESBL-/AmpC-/carbapenemase phenotypes. The outcome indicators for AMR in food-producing animals such as complete susceptibility to the harmonised panel of antimicrobials in E. coli and the prevalence of ESBL-/AmpC-producing E. coli have been also specifically analysed over the period 2015-2019. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

J		Anon.			European Food Safety Authority; European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control				The European union one health 2019 zoonoses report.		EFSA Journal					This report of the EFSA and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control presents the results of zoonoses monitoring activities carried out in 2019 in 36 European countries (28 Member States (MS) and eight non-MS). The first and second most reported zoonoses in humans were campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis, respectively. The EU trend for confirmed human cases of these two diseases was stable (flat) during 2015-2019. The proportion of human salmonellosis cases due to Salmonella Enteritidis acquired in the EU was similar to that in 2017-2018. Of the 26 MS reporting on Salmonella control programmes in poultry, 18 met the reduction targets, whereas eight failed to meet at least one. The EU prevalence of Salmonella target serovar-positive flocks has been stable since 2015 for breeding hens, laying hens, broilers and fattening turkeys, with fluctuations for breeding turkey flocks. Salmonella results from competent authorities for pig carcases and for poultry tested through national control programmes were more frequently positive than those from food business operators. Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infection was the third most reported zoonosis in humans and increased from 2015 to 2019. Yersiniosis was the fourth most reported zoonosis in humans in 2019 with a stable trend in 2015-2019. The EU trend of confirmed listeriosis cases remained stable in 2015-2019 after a long period of increase. Listeria rarely exceeded the EU food safety limit tested in ready-to-eat food. In total, 5,175 food-borne outbreaks were reported. Salmonella remained the most detected agent but the number of outbreaks due to S. Enteritidis decreased. Norovirus in fish and fishery products was the agent/food pair causing the highest number of strong-evidence outbreaks. The report provides further updates on bovine tuberculosis, Brucella, Trichinella, Echinococcus, Toxoplasma, rabies, West Nile virus, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) and tularaemia. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority and European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.										2021	19	2			1831-4732				10.2903/j.efsa.2021.6406					FSTA:2021-06-Sa3434

J		Anon.							Comparison of beet and sugarcane production methods and opportunities for dual production.		International Sugar Journal					There are still large differences in process steam consumption, sugar yield and plant availability when comparing sugar production from beet versus that from cane on a global scale. These are partly due to higher sugar contents and purities of sugar beet, but also due to more developed process technologies enabling a more efficient usage of steam and energy. We have many decades of experience working as process consultants for both industries and have successfully adapted technologies typically employed in European beet sugar production in many cane sugar factories in different countries. Specific areas of a cane factory that can benefit from this approach are: heat-transfer equipment especially evaporators and condensers, sugar-house work including seed magma systems by cooling and improved vacuum pan designs, close monitoring and reduction of water input at all stages of the process, modern layout of the plant in order to reduce pressure drops and enable good supervision, and efficient electrical drives and automation systems. As a result, the improved factories have been able to increase significantly sugar yield and cogeneration power for sale to the national grid and have an increased profitability. Some specific examples of the technological improvements and benefits obtained in some cane factories as a result of the above measures are presented. A further example of the possibilities to process sugarcane and sugar beet in a highly efficient dual-use plant is also shown. This is a worthwhile possibility in several countries, where both crops can be grown successfully. Due to the low process-steam consumption of the plant, enough surplus bagasse is produced during the cane crop in order to be self-sufficient in fuel during the beet crop, which usually follows immediately after the cane harvest. An added advantage is to be able to produce directly white sugar of high quality (color less than 45 IU) during the beet crop.										2021	123	1469	314	321	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1814
J		Anon.							Economic evaluation of post-harvest cane cleaning.		International Sugar Journal					This paper examines three cane supply treatments, Commercial Harvesting, Low-Loss Harvesting and Low-Loss Harvesting plus Cane Cleaning, to determine if post-harvest cane cleaning offers economic benefits over current harvesting strategies. The project involved field and factory measurements of different harvesting and cane-supply strategies in an effort to identify strategies that maximise the total industry benefit, considering, in particular, the cost of the harvesting and cane-supply strategy, the resulting cane loss and the impacts of the resulting extraneous matter in the cane supply. The economic analysis quantified harvesting costs and the resulting product income. The economic analysis was undertaken on three large Tableland experiments to assess the most economical harvesting and cane-cleaning option of the three strategies tested. The analysis considered costs associated with harvest and haulouts, transport, trash and cane-cleaner operation, along with gross income based on tonnes of cane and CCS at the factory. The results did support the expectation of higher CCS yield with lower extractor fan speed, but much of the higher yield measured by low-loss harvesting was lost post-harvest cane cleaning. In one experiment, the treatment with post-harvest cane cleaning was less economic than the normal harvesting treatment, even after allowing for the lower transport cost to the Mossman Mill, a distance of 81 km away. These trials and subsequent analysis did not measure an increase in CCS yield from the low-loss harvesting plus cane-cleaning treatment compared to the commercial harvesting treatment and, therefore, showed no improvement to sugar income.										2021	123	1469	322	326	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1817
J		Anon.							Experience gained from perforated mill rolls in reunion.		International Sugar Journal					Perforated rolls (also known As Lotus rolls) have been in use for some time in sugar mill tandems. High drainage rates were expected when such designs were provided. However, blockages often occurred, and this design of mill rolls did not spread worldwide. Nowadays, improved design of shell materials, of holes and juice drainage capacity reduces blockages. In Reunion, the two sugar mills implemented perforated rolls in their extraction processes in 2017. The main objectives were to improve juice drainage and reduce maintenance costs of the Messchaert grooves. In the Bois-Rouge sugar factory (bagasse diffusion), one was installed as a top roll in the final dewatering mill. This roll has resulted in very good juice drainage capacity and a decrease in bagasse moisture was observed. Given this experience, a second perforated roll was installed in 2018 as a top roll in the first dewatering mill. In Le Gol sugar factory (a five-mill milling tandem), five perforated rolls were installed in 2017, three in the pre-extractor and two on the last mill. A higher drainage capacity was observed after the pre-extractor. However, the expected effect on bagasse on the final mill was not achieved. Thus in 2018, several perforated rolls were installed along the milling tandem and the experience gained from their use is presented in this paper. Performance on bagasse moisture, juice extraction, and costs are discussed.										2021	123	1470	378	382	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1819
J		Anon.							High-vibration incidents at the Proserpine, Victoria and plane creek shredders-actions and response planning.		International Sugar Journal					During the 2018 crushing season, Victoria Mill's B side Shredder developed reoccurring high levels of vibration with variability in the phase angle following the processing of low-quality cane. Over a course of weeks, the vibration levels trended upward until reaching unacceptable levels (>10 mm/s). Vibration analysis trends indicated an out-of-balance phase angle shift. This followed evidence of a phase-angle shift at the Proserpine Mill when the disc pack was found to be loose. With 10 weeks until the end of crush, attempts were made to reduce the vibrations at Victoria Mill to acceptable levels and manage the operational capacity of the shredder to the end of season by the reduction of load and speed to mitigate the risk of an extended stoppage. Multiple corrective strategies were undertaken over 4 weeks and were unsuccessful. Failed corrective attempts ultimately led to equipment shutdown with a focus on emergency repair. A decision was made to remove the rotor, transport it to the Burdekin and conduct repairs at the Pioneer Mill's Integrated Work Management (IWM) utilising its workforce and skill base. Operations recommenced 8 days following initial equipment shutdown and isolation, 2 days ahead of initially planned. This paper maps the response plan that was adopted to optimize the corrective actions to minimize the operational impact to the business. Learnings saw the creation of a Shredder Response Plan that was implemented during a similar incident at the Plane Creek Mill.										2021	123	1470	384	390	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1820
J		Anon.							Process control and sugar crystallization.		International Sugar Journal					The process of always producing sugar crystals of a defined size in large volumes requires a robust process control strategy. With sustainability a key focus of most sugar producers, the challenges are to maintain consistency (reduce wastage, rework) and reduce dependence on human interaction as staffing levels in all operations are already stretched. Siemens is working with sugar manufacturers both in Australia and around the world to help with process control strategies whether in continuous vertical or horizontal pans, or in vacuum batch pans. This presentation aims to show through case studies and reference examples how Siemens has helped by implementing process control technologies to maximise the consistency of the crystallization process whilst at the same time delivering benefits around energy efficiency and overall plant reliability. We address topics including: crystallization with NAHMAT PCS7 Pan Control solution; digitalisation tools; energy efficiency monitoring with IoT Suite and drive application technology.										2021	123	1470	392	396	0020-8841									FSTA:2021-11-Lc1821
J		Anorue, E. C.; Onwubiko, G. N.; Onwubiko, H. A.; Asogwa, C. N.							Oxidative effects of cyanogenic glycosides residuals in cassava products on human haemoglobin.		Food Bioscience					Cyanogenic glycosides are phytotoxins in certain foods such as cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), making the food harmful for human consumption if inadequately processed. Cassava root tubers are used throughout much of Africa for their carbohydrate content, processed in various forms as a staple food. The quantity of cyanoglycosides in some cassava products can be a serious threat to life. To maximize production and profit, producers of cassava products frequently adopt shorter and quicker processing techniques, leading to potentially higher levels of residual cyanoglycosides in those products. Studies have suggested that human Hb may be oxidized by the consumption of such inadequately processed cassava products. However, no scientific investigation has been carried out to confirm this hypothesis. Consequently, this study was done to determine the effects of the residual poisons in cassava products on Hb oxidation. Hb oxidation was analysed using UV-visible spectrophotometry using 13 groups: a standard control, a positive control and test materials. The study showed that apart from garri roasted for 15-25 min and 6 days fermented fufu and abacha, other categories of processed cassava products led to complete oxidation of oxy-Hb. Therefore, roasting garri for 15-25 min, fermentation for 6 days during fufu processing and sun drying of abacha could help reduce the oxidation of Hb by residual toxins in cassava products.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Protein gelation is an important phenomenon in processed meats. The present study investigated the structure-activity relationship of six phenolic compounds, that is, gallic acid (GA), chlorogenic acid (CA), propyl gallate (PG), quercetin (QT), catechin (CC), and (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) in a myofibrillar protein (MP) gelling system under controlled oxidative conditions. All phenolics induced unfolding and promoted cross-linking of MP via sulfhydryl or amine groups. At an equal molar concentration, EGCG boosted the elastic MP gel network more than other phenolics except PG. However, all three monophenols (GA, CA, and PG) and the diphenol QT increased the MP gel strength more than CC (diphenol) and EGCG (triphenol). The flavanol structure appeared to interfere with the protein gel structure development. All phenolics retarded lipid oxidation in MP-emulsion composite gels during refrigerated storage with the least polar phenolic compounds, PG and QT, showing the greatest efficacy.										2021	69	4	1308	1317	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c04365					FSTA:2021-06-Sa3106
J		Anqi Guo; Xiong, Y. L.							Electrical conductivity: a simple and sensitive method to determine emulsifying capacity of proteins.		Journal of Food Science					Emulsifying capacity (EC) of proteins is a benchmark standard widely used to evaluate the quality of protein ingredients in emulsion foods. EC (mL of oil emulsified per g of protein) is usually measured by a sudden drop in electrical resistance (phase transition) with the continuous addition of oil to a specific protein solution. However, little is known about electrochemical mechanisms behind this process because resistance, measured with an ohmmeter, is not sensitive enough to monitor changes in the concentration of protein electrolytes. Here, pea (PPI), myofibrillar (MPI), and whey (WPI) protein isolates were vigorously homogenized with oil at a series of oil/protein ratios to prepare emulsions with different final protein concentrations. The conductivity was closely monitored using a conductivity meter. A linear relationship was discovered between conductivity and the final protein concentrations. At higher oil fractions, the migration of proteins from the aqueous phase to the oil-water interface limited protein mobility, leading to a conductivity drop. EC was calculated from the regression lines; when the starting protein concentration was raised from 0.5% to 2.0%, the EC of PPI, MPI, and WPI decreased from 717, 782, 1339 to 219, 303, and 540 mL oil/g protein, respectively. The dependence of EC on the initial protein concentration and the sensitivity of conductivity to the depleting protein electrolytes suggest that protein concentration is an important factor to consider when determining EC for a given protein or comparing EC among different proteins. Practical Application. The simple and sensitive electrical conductivity test described in this paper allows for the accurate determination of emulsifying capacity of proteins. It may be adopted by the food industry to compare the emulsifying properties of different protein ingredients. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	11	4914	4921	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15930					FSTA:2022-03-Ae3924

Food Hydrocolloids					Designing composite food gels with polysaccharide-protein mixtures as building materials has recently attracted increasing attention in the food industry. By this way, it is feasible to produce the composite gels with hierarchical microstructures and desired physical properties. In this study, we fabricated a class of glucono-delta-lactone (GDL)-induced composite gels with a fixed casein concentration (8.0%, w/v) and varying alginate addition amounts (Alg, 0-1.0%, w/v). As the Alg concentration increased, the gel hardness was initially increased, but followed by a decreasing trend, which was corresponding to the structural transition of the composite gels. At low Alg concentrations (e.g., 0.1% Alg), the composite gel featured casein-dominant network; with increasing Alg addition (e.g., 0.2-0.5%), the caseins acted as the continuous gelling phase and the Alg served as the dispersed phase. When the Alg concentration was further increased (e.g., 0.75-1.0%), a bicontinuous phase structure was observed. In addition, it was found that with increasing Alg addition, the gel-setting time (Tgel) was monotonously decreased. Despite this, however, the structural evolution of the gels was still observed even after reaching the gelation point, which was dominantly ascribed to the electrostatic attraction between the two polymers that occurred at a pH range below the isoelectric point (pI) of the caseins. Overall, the composite Alg/casein systems may emerge as a promising template for designing novel gel-related foods.

J		Anqi Zhang; Qiang Cui; Miao Zhou; Xibo Wang; Xin-huai Zhao							Improving freeze-thaw stability of soy protein isolate-glucosamine emulsion by transglutaminase glycosylation.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					This paper studies the improvement of freeze-thaw stability of emulsions by incorporating glucosamine into soy protein isolate (SPI) by using transglutaminase. The occurrence of enzymatic glycosylated SPI reaction is confirmed by SDS-PAGE. Through the measurement of creaming index and oiling off, we find that both soy protein isolate-enzymatic without glucosamine (SPI-E) and glycosylated SPI by transglutaminase (SPI-G) can effectively improve the freeze-thaw stability of emulsions. The analysis of particle size, degree of flocculation and coalescence indicates that macromolecular aggregates were formed because transglutaminase enzyme promoted glycosylation and also promoted the cross-linking of protein and protein or the internal cross-linking of protein. Therefore, the particle size of the SPI-G emulsion before freezing and thawing is larger than that of the SPI emulsion. After freeze-thaw cycles, it can be seen that although the particle size of SPI-G is increasing, it is significantly smaller than that of SPI emulsion after freeze-thaw. According to the optical microscope, it can be seen that the SPI emulsion has obvious aggregation of oil droplets after freeze-thawing, and SPI-G effectively improves oil droplet aggregation.

International Dairy Journal					The physical and chemical properties of whey protein isolate (WPI)-anthocyanin (AN) complexes formed at different WPI: AN mass ratios and with heat treated WPI [WPI (H)] were investigated. As AN mass ratio increased, the average particle size of the WPI-AN complex decreased from 92.83 nm to 64.20 nm. When the WPI (H): AN mass ratio was 20:1, the absolute value of the zeta potential of the WPI-AN complex reached its maximum. At this time, the complex solution was most stable from the comprehensive view of its particle size, potential and binding amount. Turbidity of WPI-AN complex increased with increased AN mass ratio. Foam stability of the WPI (H)-AN complex solution was 2.72 times that of a WPI solution. After WPI was cross-linked with AN, the surface hydrophobicity decreased significantly with an increase of AN concentration. Fluorescence spectrum and infrared spectrum showed that addition of AN changed the structure of the WPI.

J		Anqi Zhang; Qiang Cui; Xibo Wang; Xin-Huai Zhao							Effect of temperature of preheated soy protein isolate on the structure and properties of soy protein isolate heated-vitamin D3 complex.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In this paper, soy protein isolate (SPI) was preheated and combined with vitamin D3 (VD3) to study the protective effect of modified SPI on VD3. The structure and properties of the SPI with heat treatment-VD3 (SPI (H)-VD3) complex were determined. The secondary and tertiary structure of SPI (H)-VD3 results showed that the content of alpha-helix decreased and the content of random coil increased, indicating that the rigid structure of the protein decreased, the flexibility increased, and the maximum fluorescence intensity wavelength was red shifted. When the heat treatment temperature was 85 °C, the embedding rate of SPI (H)-VD3 composite was the highest. As the heat treatment temperature increased, the internal hydrophobic groups of SPI were exposed, and the average particle size decreased significantly. The light stability results showed that the content of VD3 in the SPI (H)-VD3 composite at a heat treatment temperature of 85 °C was significantly increased compared with the unheated SPI. Practical applications. This article mainly discusses the structure and properties of modified soy protein isolates bound to VD3 by preheating soy protein isolates at different temperatures.

J		Anqi Zhang; Xibo Wang; Xin-huai Zhao							Effect of homogenizing pressure on the properties of soy protein isolate-vitamin D3 nanoemulsion.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Vitamin D3 (VD3) plays an important role in maintaining the normal growth and development of the body, but VD3 is insoluble in water and has poor stability. It is easily damaged and lost during food processing, storage, and transportation. Soy protein isolate (SPI) is a natural encapsulation vehicle for hydrophobic VD3. This article focus on the effect of different homogenizing pressures on loading of VD3 in SPI emulsion system. The results of encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity show that when the SPI-VD3 emulsion is subjected to a homogenizing pressure of 120MPa, the maximum encapsulation efficiency is 87.63%. As the homogenization pressure increases, the particle size distribution becomes more uniform, and the average particle size became smaller and smaller. The Fourier infrared results showed that the secondary structure of the emulsion had changed after high-pressure homogenization. The light stability and storage stability had been significantly improved when the SPI-VD3 emulsion homogenization pressure was 120MPa. The optical microscope showed that when the homogenization pressure was 120 MPa, the particles of the emulsion were more uniform. These results indicated that SPI could be used as a biomaterial for embedding VD3 in the food industry. Practical application. In this article, SPI and VD3 were used as raw materials to form a nanoemulsion under high-pressure homogenization conditions. The light stability and storage stability of SPI-VD3 nanoemulsion with different homogenization pressures were explored. Since VD3 has many benefits to the human body, SPI loaded with VD3 in the form of nanoemulsion can be used in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceutical industries. This article hopes to provide a basis for better adding VD3 in the food industry. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	8			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13757					FSTA:2021-11-Ae16604
J		Anqi Zhang; Qiang Cui; Zhichao Yu; Xibo Wang; Xin-huai Zhao							Effects of transglutaminase glycosylated soy protein isolate on its structure and interfacial properties.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The structural and interfacial properties of soybean protein isolate (SPI) after glycosylation by the transglutaminase method were studied. It is hoped that preliminary explorations will find a new food ingredient and broader application of SPI in the food industry. Results. The contents of free amino proves that transglutaminase can insert glucosamine into SPI through its transamination, and realize the enzymatic glycosylated SPI. The results of structure properties showed that a decrease in the content of the alpha-helical structure indicates that the rigid structure of the protein is opened and the flexibility is increased. The blue shift of the maximum fluorescence intensity of soy protein isolate-glucosamine with transglutaminase (SPI-G) indicates the formation of a new substance; scanning electron microscopy shows that the SPI-G powder can be seen at a magnification of 2000*, and the protein structure becomes soft. The results of interfacial properties found that enzymatic protein glycosylation exposes the internal hydrophobic groups of SPI, resulting in increased surface hydrophobicity, increased emulsification and emulsification stability, and reduced surface tension. Conclusion. It shows that SPI-G effectively improves the interfacial properties of SPI, providing a theoretical basis for the application of enzymatic glycosylation of SPI in the food industry. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	12	5097	5105	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11155					FSTA:2021-12-Gg6758
J		Anriquez, G.; Foster, W.; Ortega, J.; Rocha, J. S.							In search of economically significant food losses: evidence from Tunisia and Egypt.		Food Policy					Large estimates of food losses among farms and intermediaries publicized recently by several international organizations invite the question: Why do economic decision makers live with such losses? The intuitive, economic response would be that the marginal benefits of loss reduction do not exceed the marginal costs. This paper analyzes the possibility that economically significant losses nevertheless might be occurring at the farm and wholesale levels in two cases that have drawn attention in the Near East and North Africa. In Tunisia, concerns exist that farm equipment, especially harvesting equipment, is a major source of wheat losses in a country for which the grain plays an important role in diets and the national import bill. Our analysis finds that smaller wheat farms do have relatively large physical losses, compared to large farms, attributable to the use of older and imperfectly adjusted harvesting equipment. Nevertheless, given the scale of most operations in Tunisia, there is little incentive for farmers to make the specific investments that would significantly reduce losses. In Egypt, local experts have focused on large post-harvest losses of tomatoes, an important crop, largely produced by small-scale farmers. We examine the effectiveness of plastic crates for reducing food losses in harvesting, transport and storage as compared to traditional palm crates. We find that there is perhaps a marginal gain to be had in terms of the value of losses avoided, but such gains are likely within a margin that makes adoption of plastic economically ambiguous.

However, as these biocompounds from Tinospora cordifolia are associated with low stability and poor bioavailability, these compounds were encapsulated in a core-shell matrix of whey protein isolate. The bioactive compounds had highest antidiabetic activity in chloroform extract with an IC50 concentration of 11.34 mg/ml. An increase in 28.12% activity was observed in nanoemulsion form with an average size of 82.68 4.37 nm. The bioactive compounds were further encapsulated by electrospray technique for increased stability. The particles had an encapsulation efficiency of 91.2 3.27% with an average particle size of 187 2.71 nm. The kinetic study revealed the complete release of bioactive compounds after 24 h of incubation in buffer solution. This formulation can be further explored as novel nutraceutical delivery system with minimal side effects as compared to their synthetic counterparts. Considering the potential application of this developed technology, further upscaling as well as in-vivo experimentation on small as well as large animals should be performed.

Journal of Functional Foods					Lactobacillus has been widely used in food due to its various beneficial functions and its effects on food allergies have also been reported. This study aimed to investigate the role of Lactobacillus in alleviating soybean allergy. Three strains with potential intervention in soybean allergy were screened by co-culture with mouse splenocytes in vitro. The BALB/c mice model of soybean sensitization was established to evaluate their anti-allergy effect. The results showed that the three selected strains alleviated the allergic symptoms of sensitized mice, reduced the levels of IgE, IgG, and IgG1 in serum, up-regulated the levels of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon-gamma, and IL-10, and down-regulated the levels of IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17A. In addition, the three strains suppressed the expression of mast cells and promoted the proportion of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Thus, the three strains of Lactobacillus have potential as dietary supplements for the treatment of soybean allergy.

Foods					Metabolic engineering substantially aims at the development of more efficient, robust and industrially competitive microbial strains for the potential applications in food, fermentation and pharmaceutical industries. An efficient lab scale bioprocess was developed for high level fermentative production of L-alanine using metabolically engineered Pediococcus acidilactici BD16 (alaD+). Computational biology tools assisted the designing of a synthetic alaD gene cassette, which was further cloned in shuttle vector pLES003 and expressed using an auto-inducible P289 promoter. Further, L-alanine production in the recombinant P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) strain was carried out using fed-batch fermentation under oxygen depression conditions, which significantly enhanced L-alanine levels. The recombinant strain expressing the synthetic alaD gene produced 229.12 g/L of L-alanine after 42 h of fed-batch fermentation, which is the second highest microbial L-alanine titer reported so far. After extraction and crystallization, 95% crystal L-alanine (217.54 g/L) was recovered from the culture broth with an enantiomeric purity of 97%. The developed bioprocess using recombinant P. acidilactici BD16 (alaD+) is suggested as the best alternative to chemical-based commercial synthesis of L-alanine for potential industrial applications. © 2021 by the authors.

Barley malt esterification after ultrasound and stearic acid treatment: characterization and use as stabilizing agent in oil-in-water emulsions.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					This work aimed to obtain novel materials from malt modification for using in oil/water emulsions. Malt was modified using stearic acid (2% w/w) in combination with different energy densities (33.8*106, 60*106, 72.5*106, and 107.5*106 J/m3) from ultrasound probe resulting in four materials. These materials were characterized by degree of substitution (DS), amylose content, dextrose equivalent (DE), protein content, solubility, thermal properties, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), crystallinity analysis by X-ray diffraction, and scanning electron microscopy. Emulsions containing 15% total solids (25% canola oil and 75% modified malt as stabilizing agent) were prepared and characterized. Results. Showed that increasing energy densities produced different effects on malt properties due to an increase in DS, amylose content, and DE values. The sonication process in combination with stearic acid increased malt solubility and the gelatinization temperature of malt, caused modifications of starch crystallinity in the amorphous region and hydrolysis of starch granules, and promoted good stabilizing properties for emulsions containing modified malt. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	2	310	323	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-020-02569-9					FSTA:2021-08-Ae11934

Metabarcoding reveals low fidelity and presence of toxic species in short chain-of-commercialization of herbal products.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Herbal medicinal products gain increasing popularity. The growing demand for herbal medicine along with a lack of regulation render herbal products subject to intentional adulteration. The substitution of costly ingredients with unlabelled plant-based fillers of inferior quality has been widely reported. Such fraudulent practices erode consumer trust, but can also pose serious health risks. In this work, 71 herbal medicinal products were randomly purchased from Greek markets and analysed using ITS2 metabarcoding for species identification. The aim was to investigate possible adulterations and assess the efficacy of metabarcoding in plant-based product authentication. Of the 131 detected species in our analyses, 87 were not listed on the product labels. This indicates a high level of adulteration and/or contamination during processing and distribution. Two toxic species, Chelidonium majus and Nicotiana tabacum, were also detected as major ingredients of two herbal mixtures for medicinal purposes. Furthermore, the detection of wheat in eight samples raises concerns for people with gluten intolerance. This study stresses the need for stricter quality control of herbal products. In addition, to overcome the limitations of metabarcoding and augment the approach we used Bar-HRM for the first time as a verification tool. The combination of metabarcoding with species-specific Bar-HRM analysis can enhance the reliability of the results.

Effects of ultrasound-assisted extraction on physicochemical properties, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant capacity for the valorization of hybrid Mandarin peels.		Food Bioscience					Samples of tree hybrid mandarins ("Clemenvilla", "Ortanique" and "Nadorcott") were employed to determine the physicochemical properties (increase of conductivity, brix° and pH), bioactive compounds (total phenolic, flavonoid, ascorbic acid and carotenoids content) and antioxidant capacity (DPPH and TEAC) of peels. Mandarin peel extracts were prepared employing ultrasound assisted extraction (400 W, 80% v/v duty cycle, 40 °C). The results were compared to the values of control extraction method. Aqueous ethanol solution (50%, v/v) was used as solvent in solid-liquid ratio of 1:10 (w/v). A 5,15 and 30 min were applied in both methods to stablish the most effective extraction time. The increase of conductivity enhances with the extraction during 30 min. No significant differences were observed in °Brix values; in case of pH, these differences were observed according to the varieties analyzed. The total phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids and ascorbic acid content enhance as the extraction time increased until 30 min with significant differences according to the mandarin variety. "Clemenvilla" peels treated by 30 min had the highest amounts of total flavonoids (76.7 mg CE/100g) and ascorbic acid content (136 mg AA/100g). "Ortanique" and "Nadorcott" peels had the highest values of total phenolic content (1230 GAE/100g) and total carotenoids (8173 mug beta-carotene/100g), respectively. Antioxidant capacity values were stronger influenced by flavonoids and ascorbic acid content in both assays applied (DPPH and TEAC). Results. Indicated that "Clemenvilla" and "Ortanique" peel extracts by USN were the samples with highest values by DPPH and TEAC assays respectively (average of 12.2 and 25.7 mmol TE/100g, respectively).

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, quinoa protein isolate (QPI) (0, 4.0, 8.0 and 12.0 g/100 g) incorporated pasta was characterize concerning nutritional, physical, textural and morphological attributes. Supplementation of QPI from 0 to 12.0 g/100 g significantly (p < 0.05) increased the protein content in pasta from 11.73 to 21.52 g/100 g. The addition of QPI increased the optimal cooking time, swelling index, water absorption, cooking loss, and protein loss but decreased the whiteness index and viscosity. QPI supplementation caused significant changes in the quality parameter within satisfactory limit. Moreover, the firmness of pasta significantly increased from 0.367 to 0.497 N (p < 0.05). It was noticed that QPI supplementation of up to 8.0 g/100 g, showed higher sensory scores comparable to the control. Further increase in QPI level decreased the overall acceptability of pasta. Microstructure analysis confirmed that increased QPI levels increased the protein matrix around the starch granules. Thus, QPI supplementation can be a promising material for the food industry to produce high-quality, low-cost protein-enriched pasta.

Determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in eggs exposed to fire using a simple and efficient method.		Food Analytical Methods					The illicit burn practices on farms promote food contamination that is harmful and must be controlled by improved analytical methods. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which have high toxic and carcinogenic potential, can contaminate foods, mainly through fire exposure. Considering the toxicity of PAHs, development of sensitive, simple, and solvent-free methods to analyze PAHs in foods is necessary. This work presents the development of a new method to analyze PAHs in eggs using cold fiber-solid-phase microextraction (CF-SPME) and gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Parameters of temperature extraction, ultrasonic agitation time, sample mass, and modifiers were evaluated to obtain the best CF-SPME conditions. The new method uses a minimal amount of solvent and showed good linearity in the range of 0.0005 to 5.60 mug/g. Detection limits were from 0.0002 to 0.046 mug/g, and quantification limits were from 0.0005 to 0.152 mug/g. The method was applied to PAHs analysis of chicken egg samples from a farm near a site of an uncontrolled tire fire. The concentrations of PAHs in this study ranged from 0.926 to 1.668 mug/g. All PAHs were detected in the samples. The total toxicity was estimated by benzo (a) pyrene equivalent (BaPeq) and did not decrease significantly in the period (6 weeks) of sample collection. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	6	1194	1201	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-01971-z					FSTA:2021-11-Qa0739

Monitoring Italian establishments exporting food of animal origin to third countries: SSOP compliance and Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella spp. contamination.		Food Control					Trade of food of animal origin between countries is carried out according to specific bilateral agreements based on the Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (SPS) Agreement. As specific control plans are currently in place for establishments that produce meat products to be exported to the US in order to ensure the equivalence between control systems, the Italian Ministry of Health implemented a monitoring plan in food processing establishments that export meat (n=29), fishery (n=5) and dairy products (n=16) to other Third Countries. Audits of good hygiene practices for the verification of Sanitation Standard Operating Procedures (SSOPs), were carried out. For each plant, 15 Environmental samples for detection of Listeria monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) and 5 samples of ready-to-eat products for detection of L. monocytogenes and Salmonella were taken, in a total of 750 surface samples and 250 food samples. The presence of L. monocytogenes was reported in 58 Environmental samples (7.7%, 95% CI 6.0-9.9), detected in 50% of food companies. L. monocytogenes was also detected in 7 food product samples (2.8%, 95% CI 1.4-5.7). Salmonella spp. Was never detected. Genetic characterization of L. monocytogenes strains with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was made, in one case, to correlate the origin of product contaminations to the processing environment. Genetic homogeneity among strains isolated from the same establishment was always highlighted. Audits showed that the most part of features relating to the presence and application of SSOPs were satisfied in the large majority of food companies in a proportion ranging from 88% to 100%, except the rotation of disinfectants (44% not compliant) and the presence of a list of surfaces to be regularly checked (18% not compliant). This study allowed to collect information on the microbiological safety of food companies that export from Italy to the Third Countries. Microbiological contaminations were similar to food companies that export to the US, even if L. monocytogenes detection was slightly more common. Improving cleaning and disinfection procedures and the correct application of the SSOPs will be useful to comply with the zero tolerance for L. monocytogenes requested by some Third Countries.

Evaluation of vitamin D bioaccessibility and mineral solubility from test meals containing meat and/or cereals and/or pulses using in vitro digestion.		Food Chemistry					In this study, we evaluated vitamin D and mineral (iron, zinc, magnesium) transfer to the bolus aqueous phase during the digestion of meals with/without pulses. We performed in vitro digestions using test meals made either of i) beef and/or semolina and/or chickpeas, or of ii) potatoes supplemented or not with fibers, phytates, tannins and saponins. Chickpea presence led to a decrease in vitamin D bioaccessibility (-56%, p≤0.05) and mineral solubility (-28% for iron, p≤0.05) compared with meals with beef and/or semolina only. This effect was largely compensated for vitamin D by the fact that this vitamin was more stable during digestion of meals based on plant foods only than of meals with beef. Tannins were the most deleterious compounds for iron solubility, while phytates and tannins decreased vitamin D bioaccessibility. Agronomical or technical solutions to selectively decrease the amount in pulses of compounds that affect micronutrient bioavailability should be further explored. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Vitamin A deficiency during the perinatal period and first weeks of life modifies vitamin A and lipid postprandial metabolism in both female and male young rats.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. The effect of vitamin A deficiency on vitamin A and lipid postprandial metabolism in young rats is addressed, considering the effect of sex. Methods and Results. Sprague-Dawley rats are fed either 400 UI.kg-1 vitamin A diet (vitamin A-deficient (VAD) diet) or 2300 UI.kg-1 vitamin A (control diet), before being mated. Mothers receive the same VAD or control diet during gestation and lactation. Offspring receive the same diet than mothers until 8 weeks of age. VAD diet-fed female and male offspring display a severe vitamin A deficiency with no body weight or glucose tolerance defects. Fasting plasma triglyceride concentrations are decreased in VAD diet-fed animals compared to controls (p< 0.05). Retinyl ester postprandial responses after vitamin A gavage, expressed as area under the curves, are not different in VAD diet-fed and control animals, although retinyl ester postprandial peak is significantly delayed (p< 0.05) in VAD diet-fed rats. Lipids also accumulate in the distal part of the intestine after gavage and [1-13C]-oleate postprandial response is decreased in VAD diet-fed males. Conclusion. Vitamin A deficiency modulates both vitamin A absorption rate and lipid postprandial metabolism, which can partly explain the altered fasting lipid status observed in VAD diet-fed offspring. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

The complex ABCG5/ABCG8 regulates vitamin D absorption rate and contributes to its efflux from the intestine.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Most people are vitamin D insufficient around the world. Vitamin D intestinal absorption should thus be optimized. The role of the ATP-binging cassette G5/G8 (ABCG5/G8) heterodimer in vitamin D intestinal efflux is investigated. Methods and Results. Both cholecalciferol and 25-hydroxycholecalciferol apical effluxes are increased by ABCG5/G8 overexpression in human Griptite cells. Mice deficient in ABCG5/G8 at the intestinal level (I-Abcg5/g8-/- mice) display an accumulation of cholecalciferol in plasma in females and in liver in males compared to control animals. I-Abcg5/g8-/- mice display a delay in cholecalciferol postprandial response after gavage compared with controls. 25-Hydroxycholecalciferol transfer from plasma to lumen is observed in vivo in intestine-perfused mice, and the lack of intestinal ABCG5/G8 complex induces a decrease in this efflux, while vitamin D bile excretion remains unchanged. Conclusion. Overall, it is showed for the first time that the ABCG5/G8 heterodimer regulates the kinetics of absorption of dietary vitamin D by contributing to its efflux back to the lumen, and that it also participates in vitamin D transintestinal efflux. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Antonova, O.; Calvo, J.; Seifert, A.							Rapid detection of thermal treatment of honey by chemometrics-assisted FTIR spectroscopy.		Foods					Honey, as a nutritious natural sweetener produced by honeybees, offers a unique biochemical composition with great benefit to human health. Transportation and storage conditions as well as violations of processing can lead to decomposition of vitamins, destruction of the integrity of the antioxidant components and enzymes, and further biochemical changes with impact on nutritional quality. We developed a fast detection method of adulterations or changes of honey caused by thermal exposure, which does not require any sample pretreatment. By Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, supported by chemometrics methods, we investigated three types of raw honey before and after heat treatment for varying exposure times at different temperatures. Applying principal component analysis and linear discriminant analysis to the preprocessed spectroscopic data, allowed us to discriminate raw honey from thermally altered ones even at low temperatures of 40 °C with high accuracies ≥90%. © 2021 by the authors.

Opuntia ficus-indica extract and isorhamnetin-3-o-glucosyl-rhamnoside diminish tumor growth of colon cancer cells xenografted in immune-suppressed mice through the activation of apoptosis intrinsic pathway.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					This study aimed to evaluate the effects of Opuntia ficus-indica extract (OFI-E) and its glycoside isorhamnetin-3-O-glucosyl-rhamnoside (IGR) on the growth of human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells and in a xenografted-immunosuppressed mice model. The IC50 values of OFI-E and IGR on colon cancer cells (HT-29 RFP) were determinate, as well as their effects on the cell cycle and apoptosis induction. OFI-E and IGR produced an increased in apoptosis induction, ROS production and a G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. In xenografted-inmunosupressed mice, OFI-E and IGR reduced the tumor growth rate, myeloperoxidase activity and total cholesterol levels. OFI-E and IGR reduced the tumor growth through the overexpression of cleaved Caspase-9, Hdac11, and Bai1 proteins. OFI-E reduced the expression of bcl-2. Results demonstrated the chemopreventive effects of OFI-E, and its purified compound IGR, showing their potential as an alternative in the treatment of colorectal cancer. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Eco-innovative possibilities for improving the quality of thawed cod fillets using high-power ultrasound.		Food Control					In order to improve the quality of thawed cod fillets and minimize the impact of processing, an extended hydration phase is applied in the fishery product industry in order to recover the water lost during freezing and thawing. Such long phases not only compromise productivity, but increase the chances of microbial growth in fish. Ultrasound (US) is a technology that could reduce these long hydration times, thanks to its capacity to improve mass-transfer processes, thereby limiting the development of fish microbiota. This investigation studies the effect of different US intensities (25 kHz, 29.4 W/kg to 2.9 W/kg, 113.7 to 15.3 W) on weight gain (WG) in the hydration process of cod fillets. The influence of the hydration medium's pH (from pH 8.5 to 10.5) in combination with US was likewise evaluated. Microbiological and sensory analyses were carried out at the end of the hydration process in order to evaluate its impact. The higher the applied US power, the lower was the WG. US intensities of 2.9 W/kg produced the highest increments in WG (18.6%), reducing hydration time by 33% and thereby achieving the same hydration values as in control samples. The combination of US with a controlled pH of 8.5 permitted to shorten hydration time by an additional day, and also led to improved microbial quality in comparison with control samples. Sensorial analyses indicated that after 5 d of hydration, Quality Index Method (QIM) values were better than those obtained for control samples after 5 and 7 d. Specifically, color and gaping were the sensorial attributes of cod fillets better protected with the application of US. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The key point of progress is to replace the traditional meat inspection with risk-based meat inspection, including the elements of a meat safety assurance system (MSAS). Scope and approach. Modernisation of meat inspection was launched by the European Food Safety Authority's (EFSA) opinions and recommendations in the period 2011-2013 and consequent amendments to the EU meat inspection legislation in the period 2014-2019. For this study, the EU-funded RIBMINS COST Action conducted a comprehensive survey using an in-depth questionnaire to estimate the level of implementation of new risk-based meat inspection systems in Europe, stakeholders' confidence in the new systems and the main identified obstacles. Key findings and conclusions. The implementation of new meat inspection systems is still ongoing, as they have been fully implemented in just 61%, 42% and 38% of the surveyed countries in the pig, bovine, and poultry sectors, respectively. The main identified obstacles are existing trade agreements with 3rd countries, costs of implementation, inadequate food chain information and resistance from meat inspectors. Improvement of all components of the current meat inspection systems is a prerequisite for further modernisation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study examines spray-drying microencapsulation of iron and zinc simultaneously as a strategy to combat iron and zinc nutrient deficiency, and in order to ascertain the possibility of delivering these nutrients together. Iron and zinc bioaccessibility and release kinetics were assessed through simulated digestion gastro-intestinal (pH 2.0 and pH 6.6) on three optimized microencapsulated formulations containing ferrous and zinc sulphate using whey protein isolate (WPI) and Eudraguard as coating materials. Optimized formulations depicted up to 97 % encapsulation efficiency for iron and 52 % encapsulation efficiency of zinc, with up to 73 % yield from the spray-drying process. In stomach conditions, the microcapsules released close to 100 % of the iron and zinc within 30 min at pH 2.0, and within 45 min of intestinal digestion at pH 6.6. Thus, the microcapsules showed higher resistance to intestinal conditions. The Higuchi mathematical model was found to best fit the experimental data for iron and zinc release, suggesting a transport phenomenon governed by the diffusion process through the coating material. The results from this study shall guide technology development using proteins that could resist gastro-intestinal conditions as well as understanding the complex release process into the release mechanisms.

C.; Samikshya Adhikari; Jyoti Acharya							Pigments, ascorbic acid, total polyphenols and antioxidant capacities in deetiolated barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) microgreens.		Food Chemistry					The study was aimed to evaluate if deetiolation of barley and wheat microgreens after cultivaton in dark (for 5, 7 and 9 days) can enhance the contents of pigments, ascorbic acid, polyphenols, and equivalent antioxidant capacities (EAC) (measured by DPPH and FRAP assay) in correlation to other. Chlorophylls and carotenoids were higher in microgreens that were exposed more to daylight. In contrast, ascorbic acid, polyphenols and EAC of microgreens could be enhanced by 5-7 days of etiolation. However, prolonged etiolation reduced overall antioxidant capacities of microgreens. All evaluated parameters could be satisfactorily represented by regression expressions for the given number of days of etiolation and growth. The ascorbic acid and total carotenoids content had higher correlations with total chlorophyll contents, while the antioxidant capacities were highly correlated to total polyphenols content. The study confirms the potential of deetiolated cultivation of microgreens to enhance selective phytochemicals content and EAC of microgreens.

J		Anuja Bhargava; Atul Bansal							Classification and grading of multiple varieties of apple fruit.		Food Analytical Methods					Fruit safety plays an important role in the economy of the world for the agriculture field. Recently, it has been noticed that fruits are affected by various diseases. This creates economic failure in the agriculture field across the world. The manual investigation of multiple varieties of an apple fruit is a burdensome task that can be minimized for quality evaluation for fresh and rotten fruits using automatic computerized methods. In this work, a novel method is implemented for multiple varieties of apple fruit quality evaluation. The six different varieties of apples i.e.Fuji, York, Golden Delicious, Red Delicious, Granny Smith, and Jonagold are used for image acquisition. Firstly, images are segmented by the grab-cut method and fuzzy c-means clustering. Secondly, multiple features statistical, textural, geometrical, discrete wavelet transform, a histogram of the oriented gradient, and Laws' texture energy are extracted and selected by principal component analysis from the feature space. Lastly, the classification of fresh and rotten apples is done by applying k-NN, LR, SRC, and SVM classifiers. The cross-validation technique with distinct values of k is used to validate the performance of the system. The proposed method achieves 92.90% (k=5), 98.42% (k=10), and 95.27% (k=15) accuracy by SVM classifier. It has been seen that the extraction of proper features and selection of features results in upgraded performance. Also, the state of the art techniques are comparable with the proposed algorithm showing the probability to use for multiple fruits. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	7	1359	1368	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-01970-0					FSTA:2021-10-Je13473
J		Anuja Dahal; Bilal Sadiq, M.; Kumar Anal, A.							Improvement of quality of corn and proso millet-based gluten-free noodles with the application of hydrocolloids.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of three independent variables; corn flour, millet flour, and egg content on the pasting properties and color of the dough were studied using response surface methodology (RSM). The optimized dough mixture for gluten-free noodles preparation was comprised of 98.77 g of corn flour, 60 g of millet flour, and 50 g of egg. The effect of xanthan gum (XG) and guar gum (GG) on the water-holding capacity (WHC) and textural properties of the gluten-free noodles was evaluated. The optimized condition obtained was 1.5 g of XG and 1.47 g of GG, which resulted in WHC, adhesiveness, and tensile strength of gluten-free noodles as 59% (w/w), 53.96 g. S, and 18.97 g, respectively. The addition of hydrocolloids improved the textural quality of gluten-free noodles. Corn and millet-based noodles with added hydrocolloids can serve as an alternate for consumers with gluten allergy. Practical applications. Due to rising concern about gluten allergy, there is a dire need to formulate gluten-free functional products. Corn has been used in the formulation of gluten-free products; however, the functional value of corn-based meals can be increased by the addition of natural ingredients rich in proteins and vitamins such as millets. However, gluten-free products lack stability and textural characteristics. Therefore, this study presented that the addition of hydrocolloids (gums) and proso millet to corn-based noodles, improved the textural and nutritional qualities of noodles. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15165					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3587

J		Anum Ishaq; Abbas Syed, Q.; Paul D. Ebner; Ur Rahman, H. U.							Multiple hurdle technology to improve microbial safety, quality and oxidative stability of refrigerated raw beef.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present investigation explored the potential of multiple hurdle interventions to reduce bacterial populations on beef surfaces, thereby improving the quality and shelf stability of raw beef during refrigerated storage. Purposely, clove essential oil, UV light and bacteriophage were employed on inoculated beef. All the combinations significantly controlled bacterial growth with maximum effect of phage + clove oil + UV light (T9) in the end of trial (1.25 0.24 log CFU/mL). However, a slightly high drip (3.55%) and purge losses (4.67%) were recorded by all the samples. Additionally, multiple hurdles did not adversely affect the color and hardness values of stored beef samples. In addition, a significantly lower nitrogenous losses i.e., 26.62 mg N/100 g for T6 (Phage + Clove essential oil), 27.31 mg N/100 g for T7 (Clove + UV treatment), 27.31 mg N/100 g for T8 (Phage + UV treatment) and 28 mg N/100 g for T9 (Phage + Clove essential oil + UV treatment), and oxidative degradation of beef samples in a momentous way (TBARS value = 0.746 mg MDA/kg) obtained by T9 (Phage + Clove essential oil + UV treatment) at the termination of trial. The study concluded that use of hurdle technology can be employed as an effective antimicrobial approach to attenuate the growth of pathogenic bacteria from meat surface without imposing adverse effects on the quality.

Evaluation of slurry sampling preparation of enteral nutrition formulations for multielement determination using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry.		Food Chemistry					An analytical procedure for the multielement determination in enteral nutrition formulations employing slurry sampling and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) is proposed. A two-level full-factorial design was applied to assess the influence of the presence of stabilizing agents (HNO3, Triton X-100 and ethanol) on the composition of the slurry. Multiple response was established as a dependent variable. The experimental conditions for the preparation of the slurry were: 2.0 mL of sample and 8.0 mL of 10% (v/v) HNO3. The limits of detection (LOD) were 5; 9; and 10 g L-1 for Cu, Fe, Zn, respectively. For P, and K, the LOD were 8 and 24 mg L-1, respectively. The method was applied for the analysis of three enteral nutrition formulation samples and the obtained concentrations ranges were (in mg L-1): 0.41-0.43 (Cu), 2.0-2.9 (Fe), 1.7-3.1 (Zn), 682-1409 (K), and 217-344 (P).

J		Anupam Kujur; Akshay Kumar; Pratap Singh, P.; Bhanu Prakash							Fabrication, characterization, and antifungal assessment of jasmine essential oil-loaded chitosan nanomatrix against Aspergillus flavus in food system.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The present study investigated the antifungal and aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) inhibitory efficacy of Jasmine essential oil-loaded in the chitosan nanoparticle (JEO-NP) with probable antifungal and anti-aflatoxin B1 mode of action against Aspergillus flavus. The prepared JEO-NP was characterized through FTIR and XRD. The maximum percent encapsulation efficiency (75.51% w/w) and loading capacity (5.65% w/w) were found at the 1:1 ratio of chitosan: JEO. The results of thermogravimetric analysis exhibited an increase in thermal stability of JEO-NP compared to the free JEO. The antifungal and AFB1 inhibitory concentration of JEO-NP was found to be 2.5 muL/mL against A. flavus, which was lower than free form JEO (3.0 muL/mL). Biochemical and in silico approaches revealed the antifungal mechanisms of action of JEO-NP were related to the inhibition in ergosterol biosynthesis, leakage of vital ions (Ca+2, Mg+2, and K+), impairment in carbon substrate utilization, and functioning of the AFB1 regulatory genes (ver-1 and omt A (in silico)) of A. flavus. JEO-NP exhibited free radical scavenging activity through DPPH assay (IC50 1.31 muL/mL). The in situ results showed that JEO-NP significantly protects the maize seed samples from A. flavus growth, AFB1 contamination and also preserved its nutritional quality. The absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) profiling revealed the JEO major components are non-mutagenic, non-hepatotoxic, non-carcinogenic, non-tumorigenic, biodegradable nature, and predicted toxicity (LD50 mg/kg rat) were ranged 3107.01 to 3960.22 mg/kg. The findings revealed that the nanoencapsulation technique could be used to enhance the antifungal efficacy of plant essential oil in the food system. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	3	554	571	1935-5130				10.1007/s11947-021-02592-4					FSTA:2021-07-Cd2278
J		Anuradha Mishra; Ashutosh Upadhyay; Pranita Jaiswal; Neha Sharma							Effect of different drying method on the chemical and microstructural properties of Loquat slices.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study reported the effect of different drying methods, that is, T. D (tray drying) (55 °C), V. D (vacuum drying) (55 °C), at 500 mm Hg and F. D. (freeze-drying) (-40 °C, 0.006 bar) on microstructural changes, chemical composition changes and sensory parameter (Taste, flavor, color, overall acceptance) of Indian loquat fruit slices. In this research, loquat fruits cut in thin slices (approx. 0.5 cm) and dried by different drying methods. To prevent undesirable browning reaction pre-treatment is carried out by treating 1% potassium meta bisulfite solution for 15 min. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to analyze the changes in dried fruit structure. Chemical properties of dried products including flavonoids, titratable acidity, Total phenol, ascorbic acid content, beta-Carotene, and total sugar were also measured. The result reflected a decrease in chemical properties when compared to fresh loquat fruits. Freeze-dried slices showed significantly higher retention in most of the quality attributes studied in this study. Freeze-dried slices have a porous structure, whereas the tray died and vacuum dried samples showed a compact structure. The sensory analysis resulted that all dried samples accepted by panellists but freeze-dried samples scored a maximum. Practical applications. Due to high moisture content (more than 80%) loquat fruit is highly perishable and susceptible to spoilage. Drying techniques preserve this fruit by reducing water activity and extend the shelf life of the fresh fruit making it available throughout the year. Novel drying techniques like freeze-drying help to develop dehydrated and good quality shelf-stable products. The dried slices developed using these techniques may be used by industries for the development of various functional foods, confectionery, and food supplements for children and infants as fruits in dried form also retain high health-promoting nutrition. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15105					FSTA:2021-07-Jg8674

Characterisation of hydrolysate for identifying initial peptide cleavage site of kappa-casein by milk coagulating Wrightia tinctoria serine proteases.		International Dairy Journal					Research on identifying vegetable milk coagulants has gained momentum in the past few decades. Extent of casein hydrolysis and specific initial hydrolytic site on kappa-casein are considered crucial in deciding suitability of plant proteases for cheese making. In the present study, three phase partitioned (TPP) proteases (serine) of Wrightia tinctoria stem were assayed to understand their specific cleavage site on kappa-casein. Time dependent analysis of kappa-casein hydrolysis by W. tinctoria proteases revealed 2 min incubation to be enough for hydrolysis to begin. Molecular mass of the resulting major peptide was confirmed to be 14,542.52 Da and was further characterised using LC/ESI-MSMS. The initial site of hydrolysis by W. tinctoria proteases on kappa-casein was Asn123-Thr124, which is different from the expected Phe105-Met106 of rennin. The study concludes that even with its unique initial site of kappa-casein hydrolysis, W. tinctoria proteases could influence milk clotting probably with distinct organoleptic properties.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Amongst different pulses, chickpea is a cost-effective legume in managing protein malnutrition and achieving food security. Chickpea is rich in protein and body building essential amino acids. Chickpea protein isolates from both desi (K850) and kabuli (P1108) cultivars, were prepared from defatted whole seed flour by sodium hydroxide (K1, P1), after removal of polyphenol (K2, P2) and solubilisation by sodium sulphite (K3, P3). The solubilised protein was isoelectrically precipitated (pH-4.3) by HCl and then freeze-dried after washing with water. Amino acid profiling and SDS-PAGE of K1 and P1 were also performed. Proximate data show that, protein content was highest in P1108 isolates (P3) prepared by sodium sulphite (98.65%) and Water Holding Capacity was also high in P3 (395.54%). Oil Holding capacity was highest in P2 (445.62%) prepared after polyphenol removal. Effect of pH, NaCl concentration and temperature influenced solubility, emulsion activity index (EAI), emulsion stability (ES), foaming capacity (FC) and foaming stability (FS). Protein isolates had better functional properties than flour. Solubility was highest at pH 11 in P1 isolate (79.29%) and for 1% NaCl concentration the solubility in P2 was 30.06% and 77.5% at 50 °C. Both EAI and ES were highest at pH 11. Not much difference was observed in EAI at 0.1% and 1.0% NaCl concentration. FC and FS were high at pH 11 and pH 5, respectively. Kabuli isolates formed gel at 10% concentration, whereas K1 and K2 at 16%. Isolate structure was micrographed by SEM. Kabuli protein isolates had better nutritional and functional properties. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	3	2352	2368	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00778-6					FSTA:2021-11-Gg6326

A novel pilot study on imaging-based identification of fish exposed to heavy metal (Hg) contamination.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Heavy metal pollution in water negatively affects the health status of fishes and makes it toxic to human health. Conventional chemical-based methods for fish quality assessment are destructive, highly time-consuming, and require expensive machines and expert manpower. In this novel pilot study, the image of the gill tissue of fish is considered as the main region of interest to analyze the discriminatory behavior between normal and heavy-metal exposed fish to develop an automatic and nondestructive approach using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. The discriminatory behavior of extracted features was analyzed with the help of p-value criteria, and the proposed framework is found efficient to identify heavy metal exposed fish where the value of the area is in the range of 82% to 92% under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic. This paper establishes the scientific proof of concept of using gill tissue of the fish for the identification of heavy metal exposed fish. Novelty impact statement. An automatic and non-destructive method is proposed for the identification of heavy metal exposed fish using computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

Phase inversion emulsification of different vegetable oils using surfactant mixture of cremophor EL and lipase-synthesized glucose monooleate.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A sugar-fatty acid ester, named glucose monooleate (GluO) was synthesized using commercial immobilized lipase B from Candida antarctica. A preparation of oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion using a combination of non-ionic surfactant mixture, i.e., GluO and Cremophor EL (CrEL), and different vegetable oils, i.e., coconut, sunflower, olive, palm and jojoba oils through phase inversion emulsification (PIE) was investigated. A baseline formulation was carried out to obtain an optimal ratio of surfactant-to-oil (S: O) and Cremophor EL-to-Glucose monooleate (CrEL: GluO) with coconut oil as the carrier oil. GluO proves to be an effective co-surfactant when a high amount of oil was incorporated. At 60:40 of S: O and CrEL: GluO, coconut and sunflower oil were emulsified into nano-sized oil droplets with the sizes (in diameter) of 361.5 nm (PDI=0.170.05) and 421.3 nm (PDI=0.180.07), respectively. In contrast, olive, palm and jojoba oils produced coarse emulsions with larger oil particles with the sizes of 23822, 29541 and 31263 nm, respectively. Furthermore, at 60:40 of S: O and CrEL: GluO, up to 0.98 mg of beta-carotene (0.03% of total emulsion weight) can be encapsulated within coconut oil droplets of the O/W system with an average size below 100 nm. The emulsification process was investigated through Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, small-wide angle X-ray (SWAX) and optical polarizing microscopy (OPM) analyses. Possible effects of the surfactant mixture (CrEL-GluO) and different vegetable oils on the emulsion preparation were also discussed.

New freeze-thaw method for improved extraction of water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide from taro (Colocasia esculenta): optimization and comprehensive characterization of physico-chemical and structural properties.		Food Chemistry					This study investigated the effects of an improved extraction method that utilized freeze-thaw, termed improved conventional extraction (ICE), on the yield and properties of the water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide of taro (Tc-WS-NSP) and compared this method to the conventional extraction (CE) method. The freeze-thaw condition was optimized using response surface methodology (RSM) based on yield. The use of the ICE method resulted in a 227.8% increase in yield of Tc-WS-NSP compared to the CE method. The Tc-WS-NSP-ICE had higher purity, lighter color, larger particle size, and higher zeta-potential than Tc-WS-NSP-CE. Both of the samples contain the sugar arabinose, galactose, glucose, and mannose and exhibited comparative FTIR, 1H, and 13C NMR spectra. The Tc-WS-NSP-ICE had a semi-crystalline structure resulting in higher thermal stability and had a higher consistency index than Tc-WS-NSP-CE. Overall, the use of the ICE method provided a simple, efficient, and green alternative to CE for the extraction of Tc-WS-NSP. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effects of extraction methods on the digestibility, cytotoxicity, prebiotic potential and immunomodulatory activity of taro (Colocasia esculenta) water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide.		Food Hydrocolloids					In this study, water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide (WS-NSP) from taro corm (Tc-WS-NSP) extracted using conventional extraction (Tc-WS-NSP-CE) and improved conventional extraction (Tc-WS-NSP-ICE) methods was used to compare the effects of these in vitro on the digestibility, cytotoxicity in HT-29 cells, prebiotic action on probiotic strains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium breve, and Bifidobacterium infantis, and immunomodulatory activity measured by the ability to regulate the production of the pro-inflammatory chemokine IL-8 following TNF-alpha stimulation of HT-29 cells. Tc-WS-NSP-ICE was more resistant to digestion with lower digestibility (4.1%) compared to Tc-WS-NSP-CE (11.5%). Digested Tc-WS-NSP-ICE had higher carbohydrate (98.40.9 g/100g) and lower protein (2.10.3 g/100g) contents than the carbohydrate (96.40.2 g/100g) and protein (5.40.3 g/100g) contents of Tc-WS-NSP-CE. Digested Tc-WS-NSP-CE and Tc-WS-NSP-ICE contained the monosaccharides arabinose, galactose, glucose and mannose, the functional groups-OH, C=O,-COOH,-CH3, nitro and amino groups in their FTIR spectra, and were highly amorphous. The extraction methods did not significantly affect the cytotoxicity to HT-29 cells and the ability to enhance the growth of the probiotics L. acidophilus, B. breve, and B. infantis of the undigested and digested Tc-WS-NSP-CE and Tc-WS-NSP-ICE samples. The use of the ICE method resulted in a Tc-WS-NSP exhibiting better immunomodulatory activity than the CE where undigested (20.7%) and digested (25.0%) Tc-WS-NSP-ICEs demonstrated higher IL-8 down-regulation capacities than undigested (18.3%) and digested (22.2%) Tc-WS-NSP-CEs. Overall, the study demonstrated that extraction method can affect, and specifically enhance some property (i.e., digestibility) and biological activity (i.e., immunomodulatory activity) of the extracted biomaterial.

J		Anwar, M.; Greeshma Babu; Bekhit, A. E. D.							Utilization of ultrasound and pulse electric field for the extraction of water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide from taro (Colocasia esculenta) peel.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					This study investigated the effects of different extraction methods (i.e. conventional (CE), ultrasound-assisted (UAE), and pulse electric field-assisted (PEFAE)) on the yield and physico-chemical properties of the water-soluble non-starch polysaccharide (WS-NSP) from taro peel (Tp). The use of UAE resulted in a significantly (p≤0.05) higher yield (3.65 g/100 g) than PEFAE (2.25 g/100 g) and CE (2.10 g/100 g). Tp-WS-NSP-UAE and Tp-WS-NSP-PEFAE had fewer impurities indicated by the lower amount of ash (UAE: 0.41; PEFAE: 0.20 g/100 g) and protein (UAE: 0.55; PEFAE: 0.42 g/100 g), had lighter color (UAE: L=39.13; PEFAE: L=34.72), and higher degradation temperatures (UAE: 252.68; PEFAE: 251.75 °C) than Tp-WS-NSP-CE (ash: 0.47; protein: 1.23 g/100 g; L=34.18; < 250 °C). All Tp-WS-NSP samples contained the sugars arabinose, galactose, glucose, and mannose, had comparable functional groups in their FTIR spectra, were amorphous, and exhibited shear-thinning behavior (n< 1).

J		Anwer Bukhari, S.; Nabila Farah; Saqib Mahmood; Javaria Altaf; Ghulam Mustafa							Effects of Seed Priming with Zinc Sulfate on Nutritional Enrichment and Biochemical Fingerprints of Momordica charantia.		Journal of Food Quality					Zinc is an essential element for plant growth and development as it plays an important role in various metabolic processes with nutritional enrichment. The treatment with zinc sulfate is also economic. Momordica charantia is an economically important medicinal plant reported for a range of pharmaceutical and pharmacological properties. In this study, nutripriming with zinc sulfate (0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.3% solution) was applied to M. charantiaseeds to optimize better dose. Based upon seedling establishment, 0.3% zinc sulfate was selected for final field experiment with randomized complete block design (RCBD) with five replications. Improved germination percentage, vigor, total soluble sugars, chlorophyll-a, chlorophyll-b, total chlorophyll content, and peroxidase activity were observed variably in leaves, fruit, and peel. Other nutritive components showed maintenance in fruits of treated plants indicating that the treatment did not cause any nutritive loss. Antimicrobial activity of leaves (in terms of the minimum inhibitory concentration) against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosawas positively correlated with sinapic acid, vanillic acid, cinnamic acid, syringic acid, chlorogenic acid, benzoic acid, and ferulic acid. It has been concluded from this study that seed priming with zinc sulfate can improve seedling establishment, photosynthetic pigments, and stable nutritive value. Therefore, zinc from zinc sulfate priming has been proved as a beneficial fertilizer forM. charantia plant growth, yield, and nutraceutical potential.

J		Anwer Bukhari, S.; Muhammad Tanveer; Ghulam Mustafa; Nighat Zia-Ud-Den							Magnetic field stimulation effect on germination and antioxidant activities of presown hybrid seeds of sunflower and its seedlings.		Journal of Food Quality					Magnetic field biostimulation plays a significant role in enhancing the germination of seeds and increasing the metabolic rate. The low magnetic field effect for long exposure time and its effect on antioxidant profiling have not been studied. Therefore, in the recent findings, the static magnetic field's impact on sunflower seeds subjected to the magnetic field at varying intensity (millitesla) for different exposure times was examined. The effectiveness of magnetic biostimulation on presown sunflower seeds, growth parameters of seedlings (biomass, root and shoot length, fresh and dry weight of roots, shoots, leaf, and height of plants), and antioxidant activities were also studied. It has been revealed that magnetic treatment at 50mT/45min greatly influenced the growth parameters, including mean germination growth (1000.02) and final emergence rate. Concerning the antioxidant parameters, seed variety FH620 at 500g/L concentration showed significant results compared to other varieties. FTIR was employed to determine the conformational changes and functional groups of organic compounds from sunflower seedlings. Tocopherol analysis by HPLC showed that magnetic treatment at 50mT/45min had a higher concentration of vitamin E compared to the control group. These modifications indicated that magnetic field induction enhanced seeds' inner energy that led to seedlings' growth and development enhancement. Besides, magnetic field pretreatment has been shown to have a beneficial influence on sunflower seeds and their bioactive compounds. Future studies should be focused on growth characteristics at the field level and yield attributes.

J		Anyan Wen; Yong Zhu; Muhammad Mazhar; Likang Qin; Haiying Zeng; Yi Zhu							Enhancement of anti-proliferative activity of the extracts from dehulled adlay by fermentation with Bacillus subtilis.		Foods					Dehulled adlay was fermented with Bacillus subtilis BJ3-2, the anti-proliferative activities of the extracts from fermented dehulled adlay were investigated with six types of tumor cells, and then the bioactive components and the anti-proliferative mechanism were primarily explored. Results showed that all the extracts of B. subtilis-fermented dehulled adlay (BDA) and dehulled adlay (DA) had no inhibition effect on human embryonic kidney 239T cells. The anti-proliferative activities of the extracts from BDA against six types of tumor cells were almost always significantly higher than DA. Compared with others, the n-butanol extract of BDA (BDA-Nb) exhibited stronger anti-proliferative activities against human leukemia K562 cells and human non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells. Importantly, the anti-proliferative activity of fermented dehulled adlay against K562 cells was firstly discovered. Meanwhile, BDA-Nb was rich in tetramethylpyrazine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, protocatechuic, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzoic, chlorogenic, p-hydroxybenzoic, caffeic, trans-cinnamic, ferulic acids, and rutin. BDA-Nb induced the proliferative inhibition of K562 and A549 cells due to abnormal cell morphology, the increased cell population in G1 phase and apoptosis rate, the downregulation of Bcl-2, and the upregulation of Bax and caspase-3/8/9. These results indicate that dehulled adlay fermented with B. subtilis could be a potential therapeutic agent for leukemia and lung cancer. © 2021 by the authors.

Effectiveness of training and use of NovaSil binder in mitigating aflatoxins in cow milk produced in smallholder farms in urban and periurban areas of Kenya.		Toxins					Aflatoxins, which commonly contaminate animal feeds and human food, present a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa. After ingestion by cows, aflatoxin B1 is metabolized to aflatoxin M1 (AFM1), some of which is excreted in milk. This study involved smallholder dairy farms in urban and periurban areas of Nairobi and Kisumu, Kenya. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of training and providing farmers with aflatoxin binder (NovaSil) on AFM1 contamination in raw milk. A baseline survey was undertaken and 30 farmers whose milk had AFM1 levels above 20 ppt were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Of these, 20 farmers were part of the intervention, and were given training on the usage of the NovaSil binder, while 10 served as a control group. All farmers were visited biweekly for three months for interviews and milk samples were collected to measure the AFM1 levels. The AFM1 levels were quantified by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The NovaSil binder significantly reduced AFM1 concentrations in the raw milk produced by the farmers in the intervention group over the duration of the study (p< 0.01). The control farms were more likely to have milk with AFM1 levels exceeding the regulatory limit of 50 ppt compared to the intervention farms (p< 0.001) (odds ratio = 6.5). The farmers in the intervention group perceived that there was an improvement in milk yield, and in cow health and appetite. These farmers also felt that the milk they sold, as well as the one they used at home, was safer. In conclusion, the use of binders by dairy farmers can be effective in reducing AFM1 in milk. Further research is needed to understand their effectiveness, especially when used in smallholder settings. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Solar photovoltaic (PV)-driven active crop drying system for plantain (MUSA SPP): design, development, and performance evaluation.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					A solar photovoltaic (PV)-driven active crop drying system comprising a solar air heater, a three-tray drying chamber and a data logger was designed and fabricated. Drying system is equipped with three DC fans of 18W each, powered by 150W mono-crystalline, solar PV module, and 180Ah deep cycle battery storage. Purpose-built data logger constructed with a 60-pin Arduino-mega microcontroller and equipped with a digital dual-display screen was used to acquire real-time data on relative humidity and temperature at vital points in the drying system. Performance evaluation of the dryer was carried out while studying the drying characteristics of plantain chips at three thicknesses of 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 cm. Drying characteristics were presented in graphs of moisture content (MCdb) versus time, moisture ratio (MR) versus time, and drying rate (DR) versus time for the different trays. Final moisture contents of the plantain chips were 10,14, and 21% for the 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 cm, respectively, in the three trays. The higher figures for the 1.0 and 1.5 cm levels of thickness are attributable to case hardening. Results. Showed that drying proceeded mainly in the falling rate period. Graphs of MR and DR showed that the drying process was more effective as the chips became thinner. Evaluation of 10 thin-layer drying models carried out using the acquired data showed that the Wang and Singh model was the best suited for describing the drying characteristics of plantain. Practical applications. The results of the present work will be very useful to food processing companies producing Plantain chips for local consumption and export. A good knowledge of the best suited thin-layer drying model will help to predict the MR (and hence MC) as a function of drying time. In this way, energy might be saved and product quality guaranteed. In addition to quality assurance applications, the effect of layer thickness on drying characteristic would be very useful in prescribing the optimal thickness of the chips being processed. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Anyi Wang; Jun Lin; Qixin Zhong							Enteric rice protein-shellac composite coating to enhance the viability of probiotic Lactobacillus salivarius NRRL B-30514.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study reports novel modified rice protein (MRP)-ammonium shellac (NH4SL) enteric composite coatings on millimeter-sized probiotics pellets to protect the survival of probiotics during storage, thermal treatments, and simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestions. An aqueous MRP solution at pH 7.0-13.0 was dropwise added into an aqueous ethanol NH4SL solution at pH 8.2, and the mixture pH significantly affected the homogeneity of MRP-NH4SL suspensions and formed films. The MRPpH 13-NH4SL suspension with pH of 9.4 had smaller MRP particles and thus better stability than other suspensions with pH of ~8.4, predominantly due to the better solubility and stability of MRP at a higher pH. Atomic force microscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and dynamic light scattering results indicated the complexation between MRP and NH4SL in all treatments, which increased the intermolecular repulsions to further facilitate the stability of MRPpH 13-NH4SL suspension. The homogenous MRPpH 13-NH4SL suspension resulted in smooth films with improved mechanical and enteric properties at a higher content of MRP having a pH-dependent solubility. Probiotics pellets coated with MRP-NH4SL had significantly more viable Lactobacillus salivarius NRRL B-30514 than uncoated pellets after 30-day ambient storage, heating at 80 °C for 20 min, and during simulated GI digestions. The composite coating also preserved the probiotics viability better than the NH4SL-only coating after 2-h gastric digestion. Therefore, MRPs can be used to modify the enteric properties of shellac-based edible coatings to deliver powdered probiotics, which is significant to manufacturing solid probiotics-containing products.

J		Anyidoho, E. K.; Teye, E.; Agbemafle, R.; Amuah, C. L. Y.; Boadu, V. G.							Application of portable near infrared spectroscopy for classifying and quantifying cocoa bean quality parameters.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Fermentation duration (FmD), fermentation index (FI), pH, and moisture content (Mc) are vital quality attributes of cocoa beans. In this study, portable near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and multivariate analyses were used for rapid determination of FmD, FI, pH, and Mc of cocoa beans. The samples were scanned in 900-to 1,700-nm wavelength, and the spectral data were pretreated independently with first derivatives (FD) and second derivatives (SD), multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), mean centering (MC), and standard normal variate (SNV), while linear discriminant analysis (LDA), support vector machine (SVM), and partial least squares regression (PLS-R) were used to build the prediction models for FmD, FI, pH, and Mc. MSC plus SVM gave an accurate classification of 100%. For predicting FI, pH, and Mc, the PLS-R model gave coefficient of correlation of 0.87, 0.82, and 0.89, respectively. The results showed that portable NIRS could be employed for cocoa bean examination. Novelty impact statement: Fermentation is the single most essential postharvest operation that influences cocoa beans quality parameters including moisture content, fermentation index (FI) and pH. Unlike stationary laboratory based wet chemistry technique or table top NIR spectroscopy, this study revealed that the relatively inexpensive portable NIR spectroscopy could provide very fast (within 30 s) results in the routine onsite evaluation of cocoa beans moisture content, fermentation index and pH on farmers field in Sub-Saharan Africa. In particular, the study outcome highlights the potential application of portable NIR spectroscopy based on machine learning for efficient classification of fermentation duration and quantification of moisture content & pH of cocoa beans in real-time usage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Rancimat induction period (RIP) assay indicated GA and its alkyl esters effectively improved the oxidative stability of soybean oil according to the "polar paradox"; that is, the antioxidant effects of the polyphenols decreased in lipid system with the increasing of hydrophobicity. Results also indicated that GA and its alkyl esters all effectively retarded lipid oxidation in oyster tissue according to parameters including RIP, peroxide value and electron spin resonance assays. Moreover, the antioxidant efficiency in oyster increased with the alkyl chain length until GA-C4, and thereafter, the antioxidant effects decreased, similar to the "cut-off effect". This study provides basic data for improving the oxidative stability of seafood during frying. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	6	2938	2945	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14933					FSTA:2021-10-Re3498

Food & Function					Ursolic acid (UA) shows an effect on obesity and related metabolic diseases, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. We found that UA clearly reduced the body weight and adipose tissue mass and improved the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in obese male mice. UA treatment significantly reduced the volume and weights of the epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) and inguinal subcutaneous white adipose tissue (igSWAT) of HFD-fed mice, respectively. UA also decreased the expression of genes involved in adipocyte differentiation and lipogenesis in igSWAT. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry showed that the expression of beiging-related genes 4-1BB factor (CD137), T-box transcription factor 1 (TBX1), and transmembrane protein 26 (TMEM26) were significantly increased in the UA treatment group. UA treatment significantly reduced the weight of gastrocnemius muscle (GM) and lipid droplets in the GM. UA treatment significantly upregulated the expression of PR domain-containing 16 (PRDM16), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1alpha), and fibronectin type 3 domain-containing protein 5 (FNDC5) in GM and igSWAT. UA also stimulated irisin secretion in the serum. In conclusion, these results indicate that UA plays an anti-obesogenic role by increasing the secretion of irisin and promoting the beiging of WAT. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	14	6490	6501	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00924a					FSTA:2021-11-Aj16158

International Journal of Food Microbiology					The purpose of the present study was to control the fermentation time and nitrite content of suancai prepared with Lactobacillus plantarum. According to analyses of the consumption amount and rate of nutrients, growth-stimulating nutrients, essential nutrients and nutrients accelerating the fermentation process of suancai, Asp, Thr, Glu, Cys, Tyr, Mg2+, Mn2+ and inosine were selected as additions to suancai prepared with L. plantarum. The fermentation time and nitrite content of suancai supplemented with nutrients and prepared with L. plantarum were shortened by 2 days and 5 days and reduced by approximately 0.1-fold and 0.7-fold, respectively, compared with unsupplemented suancai prepared with L. plantarum at 25 °C and 10 °C. The fermentation time and nitrite content of suancai supplemented with nutrients and prepared with L. plantarum were shortened by 6 days and 15 days and reduced by approximately 0.17-fold and 0.8-fold, respectively, compared with suancai undergoing spontaneous fermentation at 25 °C and 10 °C. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed in sensory properties in suancai. The results of this study indicated that certain nutrients accelerated the growth of L. plantarum and reduced the fermentation time and nitrite content of suancai prepared with L. plantarum. These findings help to establish a foundation for the practical use of nutrients to control the fermentation of suancai.

J		Ao Zhang; Heping Cui; Hayat, K.; Qiang Zhang; Xiaoming Zhang; Chi-Tang Ho							Accelerated dissipation of free and immobilized water facilitating the intramolecular dehydration of N-xylosamine and conversion improvement of the Amadori rearrangement product of aspartic acid-xylose reaction.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Compared to the method of aqueous Maillard reaction at atmospheric pressure tandem vacuum concentration, a coupling dehydration method combining spray drying and vacuum drying was used to increase aspartic acid-xylose conversion to the Amadori rearrangement product (ARP). The water activity and moisture states were found as effective indicators to characterize the degree of dehydration of Maillard reaction intermediates and efficient formation of ARP. During the vacuum drying process, the water activity of the product powder decreased significantly. Because the formation of ARP was accompanied by intramolecular dehydration, combining spray drying and vacuum drying increased the proportion of bound water in the vacuum-dried product. Free water was easily dissipated via dehydration, which then converted the immobilized water continuously to free water, and the decreased immobilized water further converted the bound water to immobilized water. The reduction in bound water contributed to the intramolecular dehydration of N-substituted D-xylosamine, which would further be transformed to be the ARP through an intramolecular rearrangement. The yield of ARP was increased from 1.68 to 21.53% after spray drying. The ARP yield was substantially increased up to 77.9% by subsequent vacuum drying.										2021	69	48	14662	14670	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c05827					FSTA:2022-04-Ac5804

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The purpose of this study was to compare the physicochemical properties and flavor components of rose jam from different regions to evaluate the quality of rose jam. The LC-ESI-MS analysis showed that the cyanidin was the main anthocyanin and quercetin was the main flavonoid in rose jam. The VOCs of rose jam in different regions were analyzed by HS-GC-MS and HS-GC-IMS, and the flavor fingerprint of rose jam was established with principal component analysis. The VOCs content in rose jam was different in different regions, but the VOCs content in the same region was similar. Alcohols, esters and aldehydes were the main flavor substances in rose jam. The HS-GC-IMS technology can be used to distinguish the volatile flavor compounds in rose jam and identify the true and false of Pingyin rose jam, and has high feasibility in the quality evaluation and identification of rose jam. Moreover, the rose jam samples from different regions can be well distinguished by principal component analysis. This study deepened the understanding of the physicochemical properties and VOCs of rose jam, and provided reference for the identification of rose jam in different regions.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In the present study, 61 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) were isolated from ten spontaneously fermented rose jams and were screened through a series of in vitro probiotic tests, including resistance to low pH, bile salts, simulated gastric and simulated pancreatic digestion, as well as antibiotic susceptibility. Five isolates showed good probiotic activity and were identified as P. pentosaceus MP3, P. pentosaceus MP11, P. pentosaceus MP13, P. pentosaceus MP16, and P. pentosaceus MY8 by 16 S rRNA sequencing. Among them, P. pentosaceus MP13 had the best characteristics, which were similar to or even better than the reference probiotic L. plantarum ATCC 8014. In addition, the technological performance of P. pentosaceus MP13 as a rose jam starter was evaluated. Compared with the spontaneously fermented control (without inoculum), rose jam fermented with MP13 increased anthocyanin, total flavonoid total phenol, and DPPH contents in the rose jam, and improved the flavor of the rose jam. These results indicate that the MP13 strain has potential probiotic properties, and is suitable to be used as a candidate probiotic bacteria and starter culture to improve the traditional fermentation process and develop functional foods.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Egg white ovomucin (OVM) is homologically related to MUC2, the key component of colonic mucous layer. This study investigated the effects of orally administered OVM from egg white on the colonic mucosal barrier and the development of colitis using a colitis C57BL/6J mice model. The results showed that daily supplementation of 125 and 250 mg/kg BW of OVM partially relieved the villous destruction and loss of intestinal barrier integrity, and hence decreased the epithelial barrier permeability. The supplementation also reduced the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6. Besides, OVM administration significantly increased the relative abundance of intestinal beneficial bacteria including Lactobacilli, Faecalibaculum, Ruminococcus, etc. And further upregulated the production of bacterial metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which is a direct source of energy for the proliferation of epithelia and goblet cells. In conclusion, OVM from egg white ameliorates colitis by enhancing the intestinal barrier function and abundance of intestinal bacteria, thereby increasing the number of SCFAs.										2021	69	21	5887	5896	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00865					FSTA:2021-10-Qc0663

In vitro antioxidant and antihypertensive properties of sesame seed enzymatic protein hydrolysate and ultrafiltration peptide fractions.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The objective of this study was to determine the in vitro antioxidant and antihypertensive potentials of sesame seed protein hydrolysate and its membrane ultrafiltration peptide fractions in comparison to the unhydrolyzed protein. Sesame seed protein isolate (SESPI) was prepared from the defatted sesame seed meal and then hydrolyzed using consecutive additions of pepsin and pancreatin to yield sesame protein hydrolysate (SESPH). The SESPH was subjected to membrane ultrafiltration consecutively to obtain fractions with peptide sizes of <1,1-3,3-5, and 5-10 kDa, respectively, which were then assayed for in vitro antioxidant and antihypertensive properties. The results showed that protein hydrolysis and fractionation led to significant (p<.05) increases in the content of hydrophobic amino acids. Radical scavenging and metal ion chelation were also significantly (p<.05) enhanced by these treatments. Inhibition of linoleic acid oxidation was stronger with the 1.0 mg/ml of sesame peptide samples in comparison to the mild inhibitory effect exhibited by the 0.5 mg/ml of samples. The <1 kDa peptide fraction was the most active inhibitor (81%) against angiotensin converting enzyme, whereas the bigger peptides (>3-5 and 5-10 kDa) were the most effective (75%-85%) inhibitors against renin. These sesame products could be used as therapeutic agents in the development of health enhancing foods for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. Practical applications: Bioactive peptides have been produced from plant protein sources through in vitro enzymatic activities. Sesame seed peptides have demonstrated multifunctional potential to act as antioxidative and antihypertensive agents that could be utilized as ingredients for the development of novel functional foods and nutraceuticals. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

The high-CP group had significantly lighter livers than the CP-free group. Histologically, the high-CP group showed significantly lower liver fat accumulation than the CP-free group. These results suggest that CPs prevent liver fat accumulation, being potentially useful against obesity and related diseases. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food & Function					Lactobacillus salivarius (L. salivarius) has been widely used in dietary supplements and clinical treatments. Previous studies demonstrated the protective effect of L. salivarius LI01 on liver injury induced by d-galactosamine (d-GaIN) in rats. Accumulating evidence indicates that Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium are highly coordinated; so in this study, we focus on the synergistic effect of L. salivarius LI01 and B. longum TC01 on the alleviation of liver injury caused by d-GaIN in rats and aim to find out the underlying interaction between the two strains. We observed reduced hepatic damage in the d-GaIN-treated rats with probiotic pre-administration, characterized by lower levels of AST and ALT (p< 0.05) and decreased HAI (Histological Activity Index) scores. Moreover, cotreatment with LI01 and TC01 more effectively decreases proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha, MCP-1 and M-CSF (p< 0.05) so as to inhibit systemic inflammation. Gut barrier dysfunction was ameliorated with compound probiotic pretreatment, as evidenced by the ultrastructure integrity, decreased histological score and elevated TJP-1 expression. What's more, supplementation with LI01 and TC01 markedly alleviates gut dysbiosis in the G-DaIN-treated rats, with enrichment of short chain fatty acid (SCFA) producers Faecalibaculum and Eubacterium_xylanophilum_group, a decreased Firmicutes/ Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratio and depletion of proinflammatory microbes, such as Peptococcaeae and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005. This study highlights the synergistic effect of dietary supplements LI01 and TC01 on the protection against liver failure, which is probably via altering gut microbiota. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	20	10239	10252	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo01807h					FSTA:2022-02-Ge0575
J		Aoyagi, M.; Imai, S.; Kamoi, T.							Novel bisthiolane polysulfides from lachrymatory factor synthase-suppressed onion and their in vitro cyclooxygenase-1 inhibitory activity.		Food Chemistry					Two novel bisthiolane polysulfides (compounds 1 and 2), trivially named thiolanotrisulfide and thiolanotetrasulfide, were isolated from a reaction model of tearless onion (in which lachrymatory factor synthase is suppressed), and the presence of another novel bisthiolane polysulfide (3), trivially named thiolanopentasulfide, was confirmed. On the basis of spectroscopic and mass spectrometric analyses, it was found that these bisthiolane polysulfides were bis (5-hydroxy-3,4-dimethylthiolan-2-yl)-tri/tetra/pentasulfide with the general formulas of C12H22O2S5 (tri-), C12H22O2S6 (tetra-) and C12H22O2S7 (penta-), and they were confirmed to exist in authentic tearless onion juice. Thiolanotrisulfide (1) and thiolanotetrasulfide (2) inhibited cyclooxygenase-1 activity with IC50 values of 72078 and 46448 muM respectively, compared with 3282188 muM for aspirin.

J		Aoyagi, T.; Oshima, T.; Imaizumi, T.							Quantitative characterization of individual starch grain morphology using a particle flow analyzer.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					A novel method was used to characterize starch morphology in four kinds of starch (wheat, corn, potato, and sweet potato). Individual starch granules contained in starch suspension (at least 2500 particles) were successfully captured for each species using a particle flow analyzer. Captured images were analyzed to quantitate morphological parameters such as circle equivalent (CE) diameter, circularity, intensity mean, and aspect ratio. The median circularity of potato was 0.988, which was higher than that of other plant species (wheat: 0.953, corn: 0.966, sweet potato: 0.943). In this way, the analysis allowed for the characterization of starch using morphological parameters. Correlations between morphological parameters revealed that CE diameter correlated with circularity for potato (R =-0.67) and with intensity mean for wheat (R=0.64). Furthermore, principal component analysis divided the plant species into two morphological groups: size diverse including potato starch and outline diverse including wheat, corn, and sweet potato.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Peanuts are widely grown in Brazil because of their great importance in the domestic vegetable oil industry and the succession of sugarcane, soybean and maize crops, contributing to soil conservation and improvement in agricultural areas. Thus, the present study aimed to determine the zoning of peanuts' climatic risk by estimating the water requirement satisfaction index (WRSI) for the crop in Brazil. We used a historical series of data on average air temperature and rainfall between 1980 and 2016. Reference evapotranspiration was estimated using the method of Thornthwaite, and we subsequently calculated crop evapotranspiration and maximum evapotranspiration. Water balances for all stations were calculated using the method of Thornthwaite and Mather, with an available water capacity in the soil of 15, 30 and 45mm. The definitions of suitable, unfit and restricted areas and the planting season were performed using the WRSI. Results. Brazil has low climatic risk areas for growing peanuts throughout the year, except for winter. The country reveals that 88.19%, 97.93%, 99.16% and 39.25% of its area is suitable for planting peanuts on planting dates in spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Conclusion. Brazil has a large part of the areas favorable to the planting of peanuts. The maximum availability of soil water at a depth of 15, 30 and 45mm does not influence regions with respect to peanut growing in Brazil. The states of Piaui, Ceara and Bahia are the most unsuitable on the winter planting date, with an average WRSI of 0.22. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Food Chemistry					This study is aimed to produce and characterize a novel gluten-free ingredient from oat through sprouting at 18 °C for 96 h. The nutritional and bioactive properties as well as key enzymatic activities were studied in sprouted oat powder and compared with those of oat grain powder (control). Sprouted oat powder was an excellent source of protein (10.7%), beta-glucan (2.1%), thiamine (687.1 mug/100 g), riboflavin (218.4 mug/100 g), and minerals (P, K, Mg and Ca), and presented better amino acid and fatty acid compositions and levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid (54.9 mg/100 g), free phenolics (507.4 mg GA/100 g) and antioxidant capacity (1744.3 mg TE/100 g) than control. Enhanced protease and alpha-amylase and reduced lipase activities were observed in sprouted oat powder, which are promising features to improve its nutritional, sensorial and health-promoting properties. These results support the use of sprouted oat powder as a promising gluten-free functional ingredient. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Aparicio-Garcia, N.; Martinez-Villaluenga, C.; Frias, J.; Penas, E.							Production and characterization of a novel gluten-free fermented beverage based on sprouted oat flour.		Foods					This study investigates the use of sprouted oat flour as a substrate to develop a novel gluten-free beverage by fermentation with a probiotic (Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1) starter culture. Physicochemical, microbiological, nutritional and sensory properties of sprouted oat fermented beverage (SOFB) were characterized. After fermentation for 4 h, SOFB exhibited an acidity of 0.42 g lactic acid/100 mL, contents of lactic and acetic acids of 1.6 and 0.09 g/L, respectively, and high viable counts of probiotic starter culture (8.9 Log CFU/mL). Furthermore, SOFB was a good source of protein (1.7 g/100 mL), beta-glucan (79 mg/100 mL), thiamine (676 mug/100 mL), riboflavin (28.1 mug/100 mL) and phenolic compounds (61.4 mg GAE/100 mL), and had a high antioxidant potential (164.3 mg TE/100 mL). Spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms were not detected in SOFB. The sensory attributes evaluated received scores higher than 6 in a 9-point hedonic scale, indicating that SOFB was well accepted by panelists. Storage of SOFB at 4 °C for 20 days maintained L. plantarum viability and a good microbial quality and did not substantially affect beta-glucan content. SOFB fulfils current consumer demands regarding natural and wholesome plant-based foods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Effect of simulated in vitro upper gut digestion of processed cowpea beans on phenolic composition, antioxidant properties and cellular protection.		Food Research International					The effect of simulated in vitro upper gut digestion on the phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of processed cowpea beans was studied. The samples comprised four cowpea cultivars: a cream, brownish-cream and two reddish-brown cultivars. Dry cowpea seeds were soaked in water, blended into paste and deep-fried in vegetable oil. The fried samples were taken through in vitro upper gut digestion followed by freeze-drying of the supernatant. Phenolic composition of extracts from the supernatants were determined using HPLC-MS. Radical scavenging activities were documented using the TEAC, ORAC and nitric oxide (NO) assays. In vitro digestion of the processed cowpeas resulted in phenolic-peptide complexes that were identified for the first time, and decreased extractable phenolic compounds. However, the radical scavenging activities increased. The processed cowpeas and their digests inhibited cellular NO production, and oxidative DNA and cellular damage. In conclusion, deep-fried cowpeas when consumed, could potentially help alleviate oxidative stress-related conditions. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Apea-Bah, F. B.; Xiang Li; Beta, T.							Phenolic composition and antioxidant properties of cooked rice dyed with sorghum-leaf bio-colorants.		Foods					White rice is an important staple food globally. It is a rich source of energy but is low in dietary phenolic antioxidants. This current research aimed at providing scientific evidence for an alternative rice dish that has increased phenolic-antioxidant health-promoting potential by combining white rice with red cowpea beans and cooking with dye sorghum leaves hydrothermal extract, as a source of natural colorant. Boiled white rice and the rice-cowpea-sorghum extract dish were freeze-dried, and the free and bound phenolic compounds of raw and cooked samples were extracted. Phenolic composition, total phenolic content (TPC), and antioxidant activities (measured by 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging capacity, Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity, and oxygen radical absorbance capacity methods) of the raw and cooked samples were determined. Combining white rice with cowpea seeds and sorghum leaves extract significantly (p< 0.0001) increased the TPC and antioxidant activities of the rice due to the higher TPC and antioxidant activities of cowpea and sorghum leaves. Although boiling caused substantial losses of flavonoids and anthocyanins in the rice-cowpea-sorghum extract composite meal, the resulting dish had higher TPC and antioxidant activities than boiled white rice. Compositing white rice with phenolic-rich pulses can be an innovative approach to providing alternative healthy rice dishes to consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

Hydrogen cyanide and mycotoxins: their incidence and dietary exposure from cassava products in Anyigba, Nigeria.		Food Control					While cassava products are important in addressing food security crises in Africa, they are not exempted from recurring food safety concerns. This research determined consumption, incidence, and concentrations of hydrogen cyanide (HCN), total aflatoxins (AFs), ochratoxin A (OTA) and fumonisins (FBs) in cassava product (casava flour, fufu and gari) among residents of Anyigba, Nigeria, and also estimated dietary exposure to the toxins from the foods. Consumption data from 82 households showed that 89%, 68% and 94% of the residents consume cassava flour, fufu, and gari, respectively. Average daily intake for individuals was 0.751, 0.111, and 0.120 kg of cassava flour, fufu, and gari respectively. The highest incidence and concentration of HCN were found in cassava flour, with %TDI (EDI) of 33.3% (0.03 mg/kg.bw/day). Weekly, residents are exposed to 0.0371, 0.0077 and 0.0224 mug/kg.bw of OTA, and daily to 0.0315, 0.0043, 0.0060 mug/kg.bw of AFs and 0.0000, 0.0025, 0.0004 mug/kg.bw of FBs from consumption of cassava flour, fufu, and gari, respectively. The mycotoxins also co-occurred in the food products. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Bioactive oligosaccharides in colostrum and other liquid feeds for calf's early life nutrition: a qualitative and quantitative investigation.		International Dairy Journal					Milk oligosaccharides are the prebiotic gold standard for neonates. This work investigated the concentration and profile of bovine milk oligosaccharides (BMO) in colostrum and other types of liquid feeds. Sialylated BMO displayed a broad range of concentrations (from nearly 1.7 g L-1 to 100 mg L-1) with 3′-sialyllactose, 6′-sialyllactose, and 6′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine having the highest concentration in the 1st milking postpartum but decreasing rapidly until reaching a stable concentration at the 3rd-5th milking. While 3′-sialyllactose was present at the highest concentration in all samples, 6′-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine concentration was higher than 6′-sialyllactose in the 1st milking but lower than 6′-sialyllactose in the 3rd-5th milking. BMO abundance in colostrum was 7-9 fold higher than in other liquid feeds (saleable, non-saleable, and saleable mixed with non-saleable milk). Sialylated BMO were the predominant type in colostrum, whereas neutral non-fucosylated were similar in all feeds. Five fucosylated BMO were also identified.

Impacts of non-Saccharomyces species and aeration on sequential inoculation with Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce lower alcohol Merlot wines from Washington state.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Species of non-Saccharomyces yeasts isolated from Washington vineyards were evaluated for their abilities to reduce alcohol contents of wines. As many of these yeasts benefit from some oxygen, the effect of limited aeration was also studied. Results. Although fermentations of a high sugar Merlot grape must (310gL-1) did not reach dryness, inoculation of Metschnikowia chrysoperlae, Mt. Pulcherrima, Meyerozyma guillermondii, Pichia kluyveri, or P. membranifaciens yielded in wines with lower amounts of ethanol without excessive levels of acetic acid. Aeration frequently resulted in wines with less ethanol but with more acetic acid compared to non-aerated fermentations. Inoculation of Mt. Pulcherrima or My. Guilliermondii into another Merlot grape must that contained a lower initial amount of fermentable sugar (266gL-1) resulted in dry wines that contained less alcohol. Conclusions. Inoculation of My. Guilliermondii or Mt. Pulcherrima before primary alcoholic fermentation resulted in wines with reduced alcohol contents without excessive acetic acid production. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	4	1715	1719	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10769					FSTA:2021-06-Hj6001

Acacia gums new fractions and sparkling base wines: how their biochemical and structural properties impact foamability?		Food Chemistry					Foam is the first attribute observed when sparkling wine is served. Bentonite is essentially used to flocculate particles in sparkling base wines but can impair their foamability. Gums from Acacia senegal and Acacia seyal improved the foamability of different bentonite-treated base wines. Our main goal was to see how the supplementation with new fractions separated from Acacia gums by Ion Exchange Chromatography affected foamability of sparkling base wines, deepening the relation between foam behavior and characteristics of wine and gums. High molar mass fractions increased the maximal foam height and the foam height during the stability period in, respectively, 11 out and 8 out of 16 cases (69% and 50%, respectively). The properties of the supplementing gums fractions obtained by IEC and, although to a minor extent, the wine characteristics, affected positively and/or negatively the foam behavior. Wine foamability also depended on the relationship between wine and gums fractions properties. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Chemistry					Oligosaccharides are carbohydrates with a low polymerization degree containing between three and fifteen monosaccharide residues covalently linked through glycosidic bonds. Oligosaccharides are related to plant defense responses and possess beneficial attributes for human health. Research has focused in wine oligosaccharides only in the last decade. In this paper, a summary of these works is provided. They include: (i) wine oligosaccharides origins, (ii) techniques for isolating oligosaccharide fraction and determining their content, composition and structure, (iii) their dependence on the grape origin and cultivar and winemaking process, and (iv) the connection between oligosaccharides and wine sensorial attributes. Further research is required regarding the impact of agricultural aspects and winemaking techniques on wine oligosaccharides. The knowledge concerning their influence on sensorial and physicochemical properties of wines and on human health should also be improved. The implementation of laboratory methods will provide better understanding of these compounds and their performance within wine's matrix. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Science					Corn starch-based hydrogels are safe and biodegradable polymers with a wide array of applications in food science. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of starch and natural filler resistant starch type 2 (RS2) particles concentration on the textural properties of corn starch hydrogels. Native starch (NS) hydrogels of 8%, 10%, 12%, and 15% w/v were prepared; in each of these dispersions, part of the NS was substituted with RS2 to a concentration of 2% or 10%. NS hydrogels with the highest concentrations had the maximum hardness, cohesiveness, and gumminess values, whereas the addition of RS2 particles did not affect gel textural properties. Native and substituted RS2 hydrogels showed close similarities in their rheological and textural characteristics. Water-holding capacity greatly decreased with increasing starch concentration, suggesting that the hydrogels with the highest NS concentration had the densest network as depicted by SEM micrographs. Subsequently, hardness, gumminess, and consistency coefficient were linearly correlated to starch concentration and storage time. Fluid release was exponentially dependent on starch concentration. The degree of crystallinity by X-ray diffraction (XRD) indicated that by increasing starch concentration and substitution level, crystallinity increased. Consequently, NS concentration determined the textural properties of corn starch hydrogels. On the other hand, RS2 substitutions did not affect any of these parameters, indicating their potential role as inactive fillers with a beneficial effect on the maintenance of normal blood glucose levels. Therefore, the consistency of a food gel can be optimized by changing the ratio of inactive filler to starch gel matrix. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Purification and initial characterization of Ara h 7, a peanut allergen from the 2S albumin protein family.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					2S albumins are important peanut allergens. Within this protein family, Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 have been described in detail, but Ara h 7 has received little attention. We now describe the first purification of Ara h 7 and its characterization. Two Ara h 7 isoforms were purified from peanuts. Mass spectrometry revealed that both the isoforms have a post-translation cleavage, a hydroxyproline modification near the N-terminus, and four disulfide bonds. The secondary structure of both Ara h 7 isoforms is highly comparable to those of Ara h 2 and Ara h 6. Both Ara h 7 isoforms bind IgE, and Ara h 7 is capable of inhibiting the binding between Ara h 2 and IgE, suggesting at least partially cross-reactive IgE epitopes. Ara h 7 was found in all main market types of peanut, at comparable levels. This suggests that Ara h 7 is a relevant allergen from the peanut 2S albumin protein family.

J		Appiani, M.; Rabitti, N. S.; Proserpio, C.; Pagliarini, E.; Laureati, M.							Tartary buckwheat: a new plant-based ingredient to enrich corn-based gluten-free formulations.		Foods					Tartary buckwheat is a pseudocereal receiving increasing attention as a minor crop interesting for agrobiodiversity conservation and sustainability. It is rich in bioactive substances which, however, may lead to sensory properties undesirable to the consumer, such as bitterness and astringency. The aim was to evaluate consumers' perception and overall liking of food products enriched with tartary or common buckwheat. A total of 120 consumers (56% women) aged 20-60 years (mean age SD: 38.8 13.0 years) evaluated six samples of a corn-based gluten-free formulation enriched by increasing concentrations (20%, 30%, 40%) of either common (CB) or tartary buckwheat (TB) flour for overall liking and appropriateness of sensory properties. Results showed significant differences (p< 0.0001) in liking among samples. Considering all subjects, liking decreased with the increase of tartary buckwheat additions, although TB20 and TB30 samples were well accepted and comparable to all CB samples. TB40 was the least liked product. Two clusters of consumers showing opposite behaviours according to liking were found. One cluster (30%) showed an increased liking with the increasing amount of tartary buckwheat. These results show that by keeping the concentration of tartary buckwheat up to 30%, it is possible to develop new products accepted by consumers. © 2021 by the authors.

Mixed malolactic co-culture (Lactobacillus plantarum and Oenococcus oeni) with compatible Saccharomyces influences the polyphenolic, volatile and sensory profile of Shiraz wine.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Mixed starter culture formulation for coinoculation of wines have escalated over the years, aiming at management of the vinification along with improvement in chemical and organoleptic profiles of wine. The present work focuses on elucidating interactions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Lactobacillus plantarum and Oenococcus oeni as co-inoculum during vinification of the Shiraz wines. The L.plantarum (Lp 1) and O. oeni (Oo 1) mixed malo-lactic fermentation (MLF) culture were evaluated for the compatibility with three S. cerevisiae strains based on the changes in the phenolic and volatile constituent of the wines. Based on interactions, it was inferred that AAV2 is preferred yeast for co-inoculation with mixed MLF blend of Lp 1 and Oo 1 in Shiraz wines. The wine prepared using the mixed starter culture were perceived as more complex in aroma and taste by sensory panelists. The results indicated the possibility of improving the chemical as well as the sensory profile of wines using dual MLF cultures simultaneously compared to the single MLF culture. The study highlights the importance of utilising dual MLF cultures of different metabolic potentials along with compatible yeast for better performance of MLF in wines, leading to the development of multi-species MLF starter cultures.

J		Aprodu, I.; Banu, I.							Impact of brown foxtail millet (Setaria italica) flour on thermo-mechanical properties of flours from different rice varieties.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The physical, functional and thermo-mechanical properties of rice flours prepared from long, round and medium rice grain and of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) flour were investigated. The impact of foxtail millet flour addition on the thermo-mechanical properties to the rice flours was also explored. Rice flour from long grain had higher amylose content (26.37%), while the rice flour from round grain had better hydration properties compared to the other rice flours. The dough from long grain rice flour exhibited higher starch gelatinisation temperature and cooking stability and lower starch retrogradation compared to the other investigated rice flours. Foxtail millet flour addition to the rice flours exerted a lower impact on the thermo-mechanical properties of the dough based on rice flour from long grain compared to the other investigated rice flours. These differences might be due to the differences in terms of starch properties and proximate composition of the flour samples. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3227	3234	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14925					FSTA:2021-10-Ma6413
J		Aprodu, I.; Banu, I.							Effect of starch and dairy proteins on the gluten free bread formulation based on quinoa.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Quinoa flour was used as base for designing new gluten free bread formulation. The proximate composition, physical, functional and thermo-mechanical properties of quinoa flour were first investigated, and the effect of addition of different types of starch (native and modified starch from corn and potato), and of different dairy proteins (whey proteins and sodium caseinate) on the properties of quinoa flour and on bread quality were further studied. The addition of potato starch to quinoa flour caused higher increase of starch gelatinization and breakdown compared to corn starch. Moreover, when corn starch was incorporated a delay in the pasting process was registered. The dairy proteins influenced in different manner the thermo-mechanical properties of dough; whey proteins decreased dough resistance to mechanical constrains, while sodium caseinate increased it. The bread-making test indicated that the addition of corn or potato starch to the quinoa flour allows slight improvement of the specific volume of the breads. Further improvement of the bread specific volume and crumb firmness was observed when combining sodium caseinate with corn starch. In case of the bread samples with modified starch from corn, the incorporation of either whey proteins or sodium caseinate resulted in improved specific volume and crumb firmness. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aquino, N. S. M. de; Elias, S. de O.; Tondo, E. C.							Evaluation of PhageDX Salmonella assay for Salmonella detection in hydroponic curly lettuce.		Foods					Lettuce is one of the most consumed leafy vegetables worldwide and has been involved in multiple foodborne outbreaks. Salmonella is one of the most prevalent etiological agents of foodborne disease (FBD) in lettuces, and its detection may take several days depending on the chosen method. This study evaluates a new rapid method that uses recombinant bacteriophages to detect Salmonella in hydroponic curly lettuce. First, the ability of the assay to detect six Salmonella serovars at three different concentrations (1, 10, and 100 CFU/well) was tested. Second, the detection of Salmonella was tested in lettuces using a cocktail of the same Salmonella serovars and concentrations after a 7 h enrichment. The results of these experiments showed that the detection limit was dependent on the serovar tested. Most serovars were detected in only 2 h when the concentration was 100 CFU/well. Salmonella was detected in 9 h (7 h enrichment + 2 h bioluminescence assay) in all lettuce samples with 10 CFU/25 g or more. Salmonella detection was not influenced by natural microbiota of lettuces. This study demonstrated that the phage assay was sensitive and faster than other detection methods, indicating that it is a better alternative for Salmonella detection on lettuces. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Aragon-Garcia, F.; Ruiz-Rodriguez, A.; Palma, M.							Changes in the aromatic compounds content in the muscat wines as a result of the application of ultrasound during pre-fermentative maceration.		Foods					This research focuses on the aromatic composition of Muscat of Alexandria wines after the application of ultrasound for 40 or 80 min during a 4 h pre-fermentative maceration process. Two methods of ultrasound application were compared in this study: probe ultrasound and bath ultrasound, for periods of 10-20 min per hour. Increases of more than 200% were obtained for some of the compounds from the skins, such as two of its terpenes, citronellol and nerol. On the other hand, increases in alcohol and ester values were registered with the application of ultrasound for 40 min. However, a significant decrease in these compounds was recorded when the ultrasound process was extended. In fact, when ultrasound was applied for 80 min, content values were even lower than those registered for the wine produced without the application of ultrasound. At the sensory level, the effect resulting from probe and bath ultrasound application for different times were compared, where most of the judges successfully discriminated the wines resulting from the application of ultrasound bath. According to data, the wines resulting from the application of ultrasound bath for 80 min presented the most significant differences, which affected the aromas of white fruit, tropical fruit, stone fruit, flowers and citrus. © 2021 by the authors.

Hot-melt-extruded active films prepared from EVOH/trans-cinnamaldehyde blends intended for food packaging applications.		Foods					In this work, novel active films based on ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer (EVOH) and cinnamaldehyde (CIN) were successfully obtained employing a hybrid technique consisting of a two-step protocol involving the preparation of a polymeric EVOH-CIN masterbatch by solvent-casting for its further utilization in the preparation of bioactive EVOH-based films by melt extrusion processing. The influence of CIN over the EVOH matrix was studied in terms of optical, morphological, thermal, and mechanical properties. Optically transparent films were obtained and the incorporation of cinnamaldehyde resulted in yellow-colored films, producing a blocking effect in the UV region. A decrease in the glass transition temperature was observed in the formulations containing cinnamaldehyde, indicating a plasticizing effect. This phenomenon was confirmed by an increase in the elongation at break values of the extruded films. Results from thermogravimetric analysis determined a slight decrease in the thermal stability of EVOH provoked by the vaporization of the bioactive compound. Bioactive properties of the films were also studied; the presence of residual cinnamaldehyde in EVOH after being subjected to an extrusion process conferred some radical scavenging activity determined by the DPPH assay whereas films were able to exert antifungal activity in vapor phase against Penicillium expansum. Therefore, the present work shows the potential of the hybrid technique employed in this study for the preparation of bioactive films by a ready industrial process technology for food packaging applications. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Arai, N.; Miyake, M.; Yamamoto, K.; Kajiwara, I.; Hosoya, N.							Soft mango firmness assessment based on Rayleigh waves generated by a laser-induced plasma shock wave technique.		Foods					Many methods based on acoustic vibration characteristics have been studied to indirectly assess fruit ripeness via fruit firmness. Among these, the frequency of the 0S2 vibration mode measured on the equator has been examined, but soft-flesh fruit do not show the 0S2 vibration mode. In this study, a Rayleigh wave is generated on a soft mango fruit using the impulse excitation force generated by a laser-induced plasma shock wave technique. Then, the flesh firmness of mangoes is assessed in a non-contact and non-destructive manner by observing the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity because it is correlated with the firmness (shear elasticity), density, and Poisson's ratio of an object. If the changes in the density and Poisson's ratio are small enough to be ignored during storage, then the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity is strongly correlated to fruit firmness. Here, we measure the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity and investigate the effect of storage time. Specifically, we investigate the changes in firmness caused by ripening. The Rayleigh wave propagation velocity on the equator of Kent mangoes tended to decrease by over 4% in 96 h. The Rayleigh wave measured on two different lines propagated independent distance and showed a different change rate of propagation velocity during 96-h storage. Furthermore, we consider the reliability of our method by investigating the interaction of a mango seed on the Rayleigh wave propagation velocity. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Arai, Y.; Nishinari, K.; Nagano, T.							Developing soybean protein gel-based foods from okara using the wet-type grinder method.		Foods					Okara, a by-product of tofu or soymilk, is rich in dietary fibers (DFs) that are mostly insoluble. A wet-type grinder (WG) system was used to produce nanocellulose (NC). We hypothesized that the WG system would increase the dispersion performance and viscosity of okara. These properties of WG-treated okara improve the gel-forming ability of soybean proteins. Here, the suspensions of 2 wt% okara were treated with WG for different passages (1, 3, and 5 times). The particle size distribution (PSD) and viscosity of WG-treated okara decreased and increased, respectively, with different passages. The five-time WG-treated okara homogeneously dispersed in water after 24 h, whereas untreated okara did not. The breaking stress, strain, and water holding capacity of soybean protein isolate (SPI) gels increased upon the addition of WG-treated okara. This effect increased as the number of WG treatments increased. The breaking stress and strain of SPI gels to which different concentrations of the five-time WG-treated okara were added also increased with increasing concentrations of WG-treated okara. These results suggest that NC technology can improve the physicochemical properties of okara and are useful in the development of protein gel-based foods. © 2021 by the authors.

Antiproliferative potential of Andean Berry (Vaccinium meridionale Swartz) juice in combination with Aspirin in human SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Andean Berry (Vaccinium meridionale Sw.) is a South American fruit rich in phytochemicals with promising anti-cancer properties as co-adjuvants to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as Aspirin. This study aimed to evaluate the antiproliferative potential of Andean Berry Juice (ABJ) in combination with Aspirin in human SW480 colon adenocarcinoma cells. ABJ primarily contained 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic and chlorogenic acids. The combined treatment of ABJ (IC50: 30.0 0.11%) and Aspirin (IC50: 20.0 0.57) exhibited a higher (p< 0.01) antiproliferative effect than each counterpart. Moreover the same mixture displayed a lower reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione ratio (GSH/GSSG) than the untreated cells. ABJ-Aspirin combination induced late apoptosis stage without stimulating mitochondrial depolarization and prompted phosphatidylserine relocalization. These results emphasize the antiproliferative potential of bioactive compounds from ABJ and Aspirin combinations. Practical applications. Natural products such as Andean Berry (V. meridionale Sw.) juice (ABJ) contains antioxidant polyphenols that could reduce the need to use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, currently employed in cancer treatment, to prevent its side effects. The high abundance of polyphenols from this underutilized berry could stimulate the standardization of its production and industrial exploitation to be transformed into suitable food products delivering natural bioactive compounds with potential anti-cancer effects in vitro. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Arash Bahrami; Reza Fattahi							Biodegradable carboxymethyl cellulose-polyvinyl alcohol composite incorporated with GlycyrrhizaGlabra L. essential oil: physicochemical and antibacterial features.		Food Science & Nutrition					Glycyrrhiza glabra L. root essential oil (GGEO) has well-known antimicrobial and therapeutic features. In this study, a new antimicrobial carboxymethyl cellulose-polyvinyl alcohol (CMC-PVA) binary film was developed using GGEO as an active compound. The effects of various concentrations of GGEO (0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75%) were scrutinized on the physicochemical and antibacterial properties of composites. It was discovered that GGEO significantly reduced the composite ultimate tensile strength from 17.01 to 3.86 MPa. Further, by increasing the concentration of GGEO to 0.75%, the water vapor permeability and moisture content increased to 13.61*10-9 g/ms-1 Pa-1 and 41.06%, respectively. The results indicated that the active films possessed good inhibitory effects against the gram-positive bacteria (L. Monocytogenes and Staphylococcus aureus)and were less powerful against gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and S.Typhimurium). Finally, the results highlighted that GGEO can act as an excellent antimicrobial agent in combination with CMC-PVA composite. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Arash Ershadi; Hossein Azizi, M.; Leila Najafian							Incorporation of high fructose corn syrup with different fructose levels into biscuit: an assessment of physicochemical and textural properties.		Food Science & Nutrition					This study examined the effects of different concentrations of high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS, 28%, 44%, 55%) used in biscuit formulation on the hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) acrylamide content, and textural properties were investigated and compared with invert sugar and sucrose-incorporated samples. No significant difference in the chemical composition (moisture, fat, protein, and ash) among different samples was noted based on the results. The highest L* was associated with a control sample containing sugar and invert sugar, although an increase in F55 content decreased the L* value significantly (p< .05). The highest hardness value was correlated with control samples (6.5 N), although the sample with 12.5% F42 and 25% F55 demonstrated lower hardness 6.27 N, and the lowest hardness value (3.97 N) was related to the sample containing 12.5% F42 and 25% F28. The amounts of water activity of all samples were in the range of 0.22 to 0.29, with the highest amount related to the control sample. The SEM images showed a uniform surface with several holes for all the biscuits. The highest and lowest (HMF) levels were related to the samples containing 25% F55 (46.04) and 12.5% F42 with 2.36 ppm. The control sample with the acrylamide amount of 28.50 ppb and the sample containing 12.5% F42 and 25% F55 with the acrylamide amount of 27.33 ppb showed the highest acrylamide content. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Arash Ghaitaranpour; Mohebbat Mohebbi; Arash Koocheki							An innovative model for describing oil penetration into the doughnut crust during hot air frying.		Food Research International					Hot air frying is one of the newest processing methods that can make healthier fried foods. The mechanism of frying using this method is not understood entirely yet. There is no model available to describe the oil absorption for air-fried foods. In this research, an agent-based model was extended to describe the oil penetration procedure and study the different effects of the cellular structure of crust on oil distribution during hot air frying. Netlogo software was used for the model simulation. The simulation results of oil penetration were in good agreement with experimental data. Obtained results show that the oil penetration procedure divided into three main steps named latent phase, acceleration phase, and deceleration phase. The acceleration phase is the most critical step in doughnut oil absorption. Simulated data also show that oil penetration starts from the thinner parts of the crust. Therefore, it seems that the structure of the crust has an important effect on oil absorption pattern.

J		Arash Hemmati; Hossein Mirsaeedghazi; Mohammad Aboonajmi							The effect of ultrasound treatment on the efficiency of membrane clarification of carrot juice.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Large particles in carrot juice create a turbid appearance; therefore, membrane treatment can be used to clarify it. To evaluate the effect of ultrasound on the membrane processing efficiency, ultrasound (1,000 W, 20 kHz) was applied to carrot juice and membrane unit. Results. Showed that this process can increase the permeate flux by about 10-3 kg/m2s, and the rate of the increased flux caused by the ultrasound increases with increasing transmembrane pressure and feed flow rate; as, the best performance was achieved in 1 bar and 15 ml/s. Also, cake formation is the main fouling mechanism in the whole process. The total soluble solid content, pH and total phenolic compounds did not change during clarification. But, antioxidant activity (55%), total titratable acidity (47.5%), beta-Carotene (59.2%) and turbidity (97.9%) were decreased. It can concluded that ultrasound can increase the efficiency of membrane processing of carrot juice due to reduce total membrane resistance. Practical applications. In this study, ultrasound was applied in the membrane clarification of carrot juice, as one of the newest methods to reduce membrane fouling. The practical application of this study is that by using the cavitation phenomenon and the stress caused by the explosion of the bubbles created in this phenomenon, the large particles of the juice become smaller particles. In addition, this technology breaks down the cake on the membrane, which increases the efficiency of the membrane. This method can be used in most factories, especially in the food industry, when producing fruit juice. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15001					FSTA:2021-05-Hq5276
J		Arash Rokhbin; Mohsen Azadbakht; Ali Asghari							The effect of ohmic heat process on thermal properties of green bean seed.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Using a voltage regulator at three voltages of 30, 50, 70V and at three times of 3, 6, 9 min of boiling in the glass case, the weight changes were measured and temperature changes were recorded. Then the thermal properties of grains, such as specific heat, thermal conductivity coefficient, and thermal diffusivity coefficients, were examined separately. The test was conducted in a complete randomized design by factorial experiments. The results showed the amounts of ohmic heating duration, have significant effects on specific heat, thermal conductivity coefficient, and thermal diffusivity coefficient. Thus, specific heat and thermal conductivity coefficients increased and the thermal diffusivity coefficient decreased. The highest amount of specific heat was 0.859kJ/kg °C at 70V and 9 min. The lowest amount of specific heat was 0.154kJ/kg °C at 30V and 3 min, the highest number of thermal conductivity coefficient was 0.646W/m °C at 30V in 9 min and the lowest number of thermal conductivity coefficient was 0.293W/m °C at 50V in 3 min, and about thermal diffusivity coefficient the highest amount was 85*10-7 m2/s at 70V in 3 min and the lowest was 18*10-7 m2/s at 30V in 9 min. According to the results obtained in this study, the parameters of the ohmic heating system, that is, ohmic time and voltage, as well as their interactions had a significant level, so that the increase of each of these parameters has increased the moisture content in the sample, Which has increased the specific heating and thermal conductivity and also reduced the thermal diffusion coefficient of the sample. Practical Applications. Due to the importance and high nutritional value of green beans, the aim of this study is that ohmic heating can affect some of the thermal properties of green bean seeds and this method can be used as an alternative method in processing this product in the industrial sector has a wide range of applications. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	4			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13659					FSTA:2021-08-Jp10122
J		Arash Rokhbin; Mohsen Azadbakht							The shrinkage of orange slices during microwave drying and ohmic pretreatment.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present research was an attempt to investigate the effect of ohmic pretreatment on the shrinkage of orange slices during the microwave drying and check the effect of this heating process on the shrinkage percentage of the samples. Thomson oranges were chopped into 4-mm-thick slices and were then arranged in a way that they can fit into the ohmic heating system. The ohmic heating system consisted of a 10-mm-thick rectangular glass cell (11*8*15 cm3) with two 8*15 cm stainless steel electrodes and a voltage regulator. Samples were tested at three voltage gradients (30,50, and 70 V) for 3,5, and 7 min. After the heat treatment process, the orange slices were subjected to microwave drying at three power levels (90,360, and 900 W). During the microwave drying process, samples were photographed and weighed at 1-min intervals to check the shrinkage percentages. The experiment was carried out with three replicates. The results showed that the use of ohmic heating system as pretreatment leads to a decline in the moisture content of orange slices. In other words, an increase in duration of heating (from 3 to 7 min) intensifies the moisture content reduction rate. During the microwave heating process, any rise in microwave power (from 90 to 900 W) led to intensification of orange slice shrinkage level. Practical applications. The present research was carried out in an attempt to increase productivity of dehydration in the industrial sector and also in the fruit dehydration industry. This research was also an attempt to investigate and predict the shrinkage rate of orange slices subjected to microwave dehydration and investigate the effect of ohmic pretreatment on the shrinkage percentage of the specimens in an attempt to figure out if this method can be used as an alternative to other industrial methods. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15400					FSTA:2021-09-Jc12564
J		Arashdeep Singh; Antima Gupta; Reddy Surasani, V. K.; Savita Sharma							Influence of supplementation with pangas protein isolates on textural attributes and sensory acceptability of semolina pasta.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Suitability of protein isolates recovered from pangas processing waste was explored for supplementing pasta and influence of supplementation was evaluated on the protein digestibility, textural, morphological and sensory characteristics. Results. Showed that addition of pangas protein isolates (PPI) significantly (p<0.05) improves the protein digestibility of pasta from 68.45 to 78.80 g 100 g-1. Protein pasta supplemented with 5.0 g 100 g-1 PPI exhibited highest firmness and toughness values. The microstructure obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed a compact, homogeneous and dense network of starch and protein in control pasta whereas non-uniform network of starch and protein was observed in supplemented pasta because of the presence of non-gluten protein in PPI. The PPI incorporation resulted in higher onset (100.74 °C to 117.97 °C), peak (109.34 °C to 122.91 °C) and conclusion (115.06 °C to 130.64 °C) temperature but, significantly (p<0.05) reduced the enthalpy of gelatinization (2.75 to 2.41 J g-1). A non-significant (p>0.05) change in the sensory attributes of PPI supplemented pasta was observed. However, intensity of fish flavour increased in the pasta from 1.5 to 4.4 with increased PPI levels. Among different level tested, pasta supplemented with 5.0 g 100 g-1 isolates gave better sensory scores and low fish flavour intensity in pasta. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1317	1326	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00728-2					FSTA:2021-10-Mq6159
J		Arashdeep Singh; Hanuman Bobade; Savita Sharma; Baljit Singh; Antima Gupta							Enhancement of digestibility of nutrients (in vitro), antioxidant potential and functional attributes of wheat flour through grain germination.		Plant Foods for Human Nutrition					Wheat grains were germinated at different time (12, 24, 36, and 48 h) and temperature (25, 30, and 35 °C) to enhance the functionality of resultant flour. Results. Revealed that an increase in germination time and temperature enhanced the in vitro digestibility of starch (10.35-42.30%) and proteins (6.31-44.02%) owing to their depolymerization by hydrolytic enzymes. Total phenolic and flavonoid content of wheat during germination at variable conditions were enhanced significantly (p< 0.05) from 3.62 to 5.54 mg GAE/g and 32.06 to 54.33 mg QE/100 g, respectively. Germination at elevated temperature (35 °C) for a prolonged time (48 h) increased the DPPH RSA by 58.85%, reducing power by 80.40% and metal chelating activity by 112.26% as a result of the structural breakdown of bound phenolics. Increased activity of hydrolytic enzymes also results in a continuous reduction in the viscosity and lightness values of wheat flour. Tailored germination, therefore, can be offered as a tool to increase the nutrient digestibility and bioactive potential of wheat thus resulting in producing the naturally modified flour with enhanced functionality. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	76	1	118	124	0921-9668				10.1007/s11130-021-00881-z					FSTA:2021-10-Mj6236

Effect of drying temperature on the physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of "Palmer" mango peels.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The present study evaluated the effects of temperature in the drying of "Palmer" mango peel on its physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity, generating information for a better utilization of this by-product and its use in food products. Peels with average thickness of 1.5mm were dried in an air circulation oven at different temperatures (40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 °C). Mathematical models (empirical and diffusive) were fitted to the experimental data obtained and, subsequently, the dehydrated peels were crushed to obtain the powders, which were characterized in terms of physical attributes, physicochemical attributes, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity (ABTS+, DPPH, and FRAP). The diffusion model indicated that "Palmer" mango peels show a uniform moisture distribution over time and the Wang and Singh model does not have a consistent physical behavior for the study (R2<.91). The extraction process using solvents with different polarities allowed the extraction of phenolic compounds (13,761.321.12mg/kg), but aqueous extraction revealed superior results for antioxidant activity by the different methods: ABTS (31.721.00mM TEAC/kg), DPPH (162.260.23mM TEAC/kg), and FRAP (66.632.27mM Fe2+/kg). The temperature of 60 °C was the most efficient for drying the peels. Practical applications. The powder obtained in the present study showed functional potential, as a source of bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity, highlighting the possibility of its use as additive and supplement or incorporated in the formulation of new foods. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		; Pereira da Silva, Wilton/E-1162-2019	de Brito Araujo, Ana Julia/0000-0003-1758-8085; Pereira da Silva, Wilton/0000-0001-5841-6023; Santos, Newton Carlos/0000-0002-9603-2503							2021	44	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13860					FSTA:2022-03-Jd2974
J		Araujo, C. da S.; Macedo, L. L.; Vimercati, W. C.; Saraiva, S. H.							Spectroscopy technique applied to estimate sensory parameters and quantification of total phenolic compounds in coffee.		Food Analytical Methods					Near-infrared spectra were collected from green coffee and the partial least squares (PLS) regression method was used to develop multivariate models to estimate the sensory scores and content of total phenolic compounds in the coffee. The PLS models were elaborated from pretreated and original spectral data, presenting high correlation coefficients between the experimental and predicted values. Regarding sensory attributes, acidity, body, balance, flavor, aftertaste, fragrance, overall cup preference, and total specialty quality were evaluated. All sensory parameters showed satisfactory prediction results. However, the best prediction model was built for the body attribute, which presented a correlation of 0.92 in the cross-validation phase and 0.85 for the external validation. The highest correlation value for total phenolic compounds was 0.93 for cross-validation and 0.89 for external validation. Thus, the analysis by near infrared demonstrated to be applicable and to be an effective tool for sensorial and chemical analysis of arabica coffee. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	9	1943	1952	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-02025-0					FSTA:2022-06-Hn5452

How much can sodium chloride be substituted for potassium chloride without affecting the sensory acceptance of cracker-type biscuits?		Food Research International					Excessive sodium consumption is a worldwide public health concern. The substitution of sodium chloride (NaCl) for potassium chloride (KCl) has been adopted to reduce the sodium concentration in processed foods. The challenge is to make this substitution without affecting the sensory acceptance of foods. In this context, the objective was to determine from which concentrations the replacement of NaCl by KCl results in reduced acceptance (compromised acceptance threshold-CAT) and begins the sensory rejection (hedonic rejection threshold-HRT) of cracker-type biscuits. Using the hedonic thresholds methodology (HTM) by varying a stimulus, CAT and HRT were determined for the concentration of NaCl in crackers and, by varying two stimuli, CAT and HRT, for replacing NaCl with KCl in crackers were determined. Without the addition of KCl, the reduction in acceptance started to occur by reducing the NaCl content by around 60% (from 1.81% to 0.73%); and sensory rejection began to appear by reducing the NaCl content by approximately 93% (1.81% to 0.13%). Reduction in the acceptance started to occur by lowering the NaCl content by around 78% (from 1.81% to 0.397%), with the addition of 0.896% KCl. In addition, by adding KCl, it was possible to reduce 100% NaCl without sensory rejection of the crackers. With these results, cracker industries can reduce the sodium content of their products, contributing to the reduction of population salt intake. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sodium is essential for the production of meat derivatives. However, the relationship between sodium and health problems has driven the meat industry to seek alternatives to reducing sodium in its products. Alternative salts with lower sodium contents have been used for this purpose. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using four different types of salt (100% NaCl, T1; 100% Himalayan salt, T2; 50% NaCl+ 50% KCl, T3 or 50% NaCl+ 25% KCl+ 20% MgCl2+ 5% CaCl2, T4) on physicochemical, textural, microbiological and sensory characteristics of frozen goat sausage. Sodium content was lower (17.6%) in T3 and T4 (P< 0.01). There was no treatment effect and no interaction between treatments and storage time (1,30, 60 and 90 days) for instrumental color, pH and lipid oxidation (P> 0.05). Lower cooking loss (P< 0.05) was found in T2. There was no treatment effect (P> 0.05) on water activity, water holding capacity and sensory analysis. The reduction of sodium by replacing NaCl with chloride salts at the studied levels had no negative influence on the physicochemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics of frozen goat sausage.

Influence of high-intensity ultrasound on color, chemical composition and antioxidant properties of araca-boi pulp.		Food Chemistry					In this study, we evaluated the influence of the ultrasound application on five levels of energy density (1000; 3000; 5000 and 7000 J g-1) compared to two pasteurization techniques (70 °C/5 min and 94 °C/0.5 min) on color parameters, polyphenoloxidase activity, chemical composition, and antioxidant properties of araca-boi pulp. Ultrasound caused changes in the parameters brightness/darkness, hue angle, and total color difference, but did not change chroma, yellowness/blueness, color index, and yellow index. Moreover, this technique was efficient for inactivating polyphenoloxidase. Ultrasound at 7000 J g-1 was responsible for an increase in soluble solids (16%), vitamin C (46.5%), phenolics (15.65%), flavonoids (50%) and antioxidant capacity in relation to untreated pulp, while ultrasound at 5000 J g-1 increased the relative intensity of compounds of biological interest. Thus, ultrasound can be considered as a promising technique to maintain the shelf life, without drastically affecting the nutritional and functional qualities of this fruit.

Chemical characterization of Eugenia stipitata: a native fruit from the Amazon rich in nutrients and source of bioactive compounds.		Food Research International					Eugenia stipitata is a fruit native to the Brazilian Amazonian region, belonging to the Myrtaceae family whose chemical composition has been little evidenced. In this study, we evaluated for the first time the nutritional composition, bioactive compounds and antioxidant properties of two fractions of this fruit. It was observed that the edible fraction had a higher content of minerals such as K, Ca and Mg (827.6614.51; 107.161.54; and 75.651.28 mg 100 g-1 dw, respectively), sucrose (38.012.94 mg g-1 dw), fructose (17.580.80 mg g-1 dw), and maltotetraose (1.630.09 mg g-1 dw). In this same fraction, about 30 volatile compounds were found, mainly biciclo (3.2.1) octan-3-one, 6 (2-hydroxyethyl)-, endo-; butanoic acid, 2-methyl-, hexyl ester and p-ocimene. In turn, the seed had the highest number of compounds identified by ESI-LTQ-MS/MS (including vanillic acid, gallic acid hexoside, catechin hexoside, luteolin hexoside, among others), higher content of phenolics (142.430.82 mg GAE g-1 dw), flavonoids (43.730.23 mg CE g-1 dw), and antioxidant capacity (139.592.47; 447.942.70; and 100.0710.50 M TE g-1 dw for DPPH, ABTS, and ORAC, respectively). These results suggest that Eugenia stipitata has excellent nutritional value and great functional potential, and may contribute to a greater commercial exploitation of this fruit, not only in food, but also in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries.

Gastrointestinal bioaccessibility and bioactivity of phenolic compounds from araca-boi fruit.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, we evaluated for the first time the bioaccessibility and bioactivity of phenolic compounds present in fractions of araca-boi submitted to the in vitro gastrointestinal digestion. For this, were determined the content of phenolics and total flavonoids, antioxidant capacity, as well as heatmap analysis to evaluate the relative intensity of the phenolic compounds identified by ESI-LTQ-XL-MS/MS, before and after digestive process. It was observed that the seed had the highest amount of total phenolic compounds, and that this content was reduced after digestion, mainly in the intestinal phase (-22.0%), while the flavonoid content increased in the edible fraction (92.8%). From the ESI-LTQXL-MS/MS analysis, it was possible to identify 9 flavonoids and 8 phenolic acids in the edible fraction, while in the seed 10 flavonoids and 7 phenolic acids were identified. Heatmap analysis demonstrated that after intestinal digestion, phenolic acids reduced and flavonoids increased their relative intensity, suggesting that these compounds increased their content after this process. The seed showed the highest antioxidant capacity and in general this potential increased after digestion. Thus, the bioaccessibility and bioactivity of the phenolic compounds of araca-boi can be influenced by the fraction and digestive phase evaluated.

In-mouth attributes driving perceived quality of Pinot noir wines: sensory and chemical characterisation.		Food Research International					We investigated perception of mouthfeel in Pinot noir wines and its physicochemical determinants. Seventeen wine professionals judged 18 Pinot noir wines via two tasting tasks, Descriptive Rating and Directed Sorting, the latter based on perception of in-mouth attributes. Selected chemical measures of the same 18 wines were determined. Sensory results demonstrated that mouthfeel attributes driving high quality were smoothness/silky/velvety, volume/fullness/roundness, overall body, and viscosity/mouth-coating, while the taste of bitterness and perceived tannin harshness drove low quality judgments. Perceived astringency and expressions of tannin (e.g., soft; harsh; fine) drove sorting behaviour of participants. Partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to associate perceived in-mouth phenomena and chemical composition. The phenolic profile, in particular tannin concentration and structure, was the most important predictor of astringency and its sub-components. These results have important implications for wine producers aiming to enhance perceived quality in their Pinot noir wines. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Araujo, M. E. V.; Correa, P. C.; Barbosa, E. G.; Martins, M. A.							Determination and modeling of physical and aerodynamic properties of coffee beans (Coffea arabica) during the drying process.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The objective of this study was to determine and model the variation in the physical and aerodynamic properties of Arabica coffee beans during the drying process. The main physical properties (unit specific mass, sphericity, circularity, geometric diameter, projected area, volume, and volumetric contraction) and aerodynamic properties (terminal velocity and drag coefficient, actual and theoretical) were determined under different moisture content levels. It was found that the reduction in moisture content during drying resulted in major changes in the physical and aerodynamic properties of the coffee. Among the most significant changes, we can mention the 32% reduction in unit-specific mass and a 20% volumetric contraction. In addition, a 28% reduction in terminal velocity was observed, indicating that coffee beans can be separated by gravimetric methods at different moisture content levels. The new method, used to evaluate the theoretical aerodynamic properties, was satisfactory, presenting results similar to the experimental ones. Novelty impact statement. This article is one of the only ones to provide a complete modeling and analysis of the physical and aerodynamic properties of coffee beans. A new model for obtaining theoretical aerodynamic properties was used in this study, which considers the sphericity of the product. The results found are of great interest because it allows from the creation and design of new equipment to various types of studies and numerical approaches. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15698					FSTA:2022-01-Hn0108
J		Araujo, M. E. V. de; Barbosa, E. G.; Lopes, R. P.; Correa, P. C.; Barbosa, E. G.							Infrared drying of pear slices: drying kinetics, energy, and exergy analysis.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Over the last few decades, the drying process has proven to be a fundamental operation within the food industry, as it prolongs the shelf life and reduces the levels of deterioration of the product. Infrared drying has gained great attention in recent years as it promotes more uniform and energy-efficient drying. Given the above, this study aimed to perform infrared drying of pear slices at different temperatures, evaluating the drying kinetics, and the thermodynamic analysis. The pear slices 3-mm thick were dried in an infrared dryer at temperatures between 50 and 100 °C until constant mass. Different mathematical models were fitted to the experimental data to represent drying as a function of time. Energy and exergy analysis were performed by applying the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The Henderson and Pabis modified model satisfactorily represented the drying of pear slices. The effective diffusion coefficient increased linearly with increasing temperature, ranging from 1.15*10-9 and 5.08*10-9 m2/s. From Arrhenius's relations, the activation energy of the drying process of pear slices was 29.87kJ/mol. The lowest specific energy consumption (10.28kWh/kg) was observed for higher drying temperature. The drying temperature positively influenced the energy and exergy efficiencies of the process. The efficiency of the first law of thermodynamics varied between 40 and 99%. The increase in the energy required in the dryer, overcomes the destruction of exergy in the equipment. Practical Applications. Infrared radiation drying is a promising high-efficiency technology. One of the main advantages of this method is the significant reduction in drying time compared with convective drying. For a complete evaluation of the drying system, analysis of the first and second laws of thermodynamics must be applied. Few studies on energy and exergy analysis of infrared dryers are found. A detailed literature review showed that there is no information on energy and exergy analysis of the infrared drying process of pear slices. It is believed that this study will contribute to the pear food industry by providing results from the best drying process in terms of kinetics, energy, and exergy. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	12			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13915					FSTA:2022-03-Je3909

Journal of Food Process Engineering					The reduction of moisture content in coffee cherries, during drying, directly influences their physical and aerodynamic properties and quality. The knowledge of these properties is essential for cost reduction, correct conservation, and defining parameters and operation of equipment in the main postharvest operations of the crop. In this study, the main physical properties (unit specific mass, sphericity, circularity, geometric diameter, projected area, volume, and volumetric contraction) and aerodynamic properties (terminal velocity and drag coefficient, actual, and theoretical) were determined during the coffee cherries drying. The reduction of the moisture content during drying provides a reduction of 30% in the specific density of coffee cherries. In addition, it promotes the reduction of sphericity, circularity, projected area, geometric diameter, and volume of the fruits. A volumetric reduction of 40% during the drying process was observed. A new model was proposed to represent the volumetric contraction of coffee cherries during drying. The experimental terminal velocity of coffee cherries decreased during the drying process, while the drag coefficient showed an increasing trend. The theoretical aerodynamic properties found in this study, presented values close to the experimental ones, representing satisfactorily the phenomena in the function of the moisture content. Practical Applications. Coffee is one of the most important commercial cultures in the world. The physical and aerodynamic properties are essential for the correct handling, separation, cleaning, storage, and transport of coffee. This data will provide important information needed to design different aspects of coffee processing (such as cleaning, sorting, and drying) and storage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	10			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13801					FSTA:2022-02-Hn1101

Balance between oxidative stress and the antioxidant system is associated with the level of cold tolerance in sweet potato roots.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					The balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant defense system was investigated in roots of the cold-sensitive (cvs. BRS Rubissol and BRS Cuia) and cold-tolerant (cv. Beauregard) sweet potato stored at 6 or 13 °C for 60 d. We hypothesized that the absence of chilling injury symptoms on cv. Beauregard stored at 6 °C depends on the induction capacity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant systems. The manifestation of chilling injury symptoms on cvs. BRS Rubissol and BRS Cuia were associated with the loss of membrane integrity, increased lipid peroxidation, accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and low catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities. In these cold-sensitive cultivars, proline and total phenolics increased with the progression of chilling injury, acting as markers for cold sensitivity, and parallel increased activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. In contrast, constitutive levels of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, as well as stress-induced increased CAT and APX activity played an important role in the detoxification of H2O2 in the tolerant cv. Beauregard. Our results suggest that the balance between oxidative stress and antioxidant system is involved in the tolerance of cv. Beauregard to chilling injury.

The impact of seawater warming on fatty acid composition and nutritional quality indices of Trematomus bernacchii from the Antarctic region.		Food Chemistry					There is a growing interest in exploiting Antarctic fisheries for human consumption. However, information on how the nutritional qualities of these resources will respond to the predicted seawater warming in the region for the next century is poor. The present research investigates changes in various nutritional indices of dietary importance (e.g. the ratio polyunsaturated to saturated fatty acids, the atherogenicity index, the thrombogenicity index, the hypo-cholesterolemic to hyper-cholesterolemic index, the health-promoting index, the flesh lipid quality and the ratio omega-3 to omega-6 index) by determining the fatty acid composition in muscle of Trematomus bernacchii (an Antarctic fish species) in its natural habitat (-1.87 °C) and warmer temperatures (0.0, 1.0, 2.0 °C). Comparison of the estimated nutritional indices at -1.87 °C with those at warmer temperatures revealed that seawater warming caused changes in the nutritional indices in the range of -12%< Delta < 30%. The observed changes were not statistically significant and ascribed to biological variability. Therefore, the nutritional values of T. bernacchii muscle were preserved after increasing the temperature of its natural habitat by + 4 °C. The present research is the first report describing the nutritional quality indices for an Antarctic fish species and the consequences of seawater warming on the nutritional value of T. bernacchii.

Postprandial glucose-lowering effect of cagaita (Eugenia dysenterica DC) fruit juice in dysglycemic subjects with metabolic syndrome: an exploratory study.		Food Research International					Cagaita (Eugenia dysenterica DC) is an ellagitannin-containing Myrtaceae fruit from Cerrado biome. This fruit seems to be a promising candidate for an adjuvant in glucose regulation in healthy subjects. However, it is not known whether cagaita juice would have the same effect on dysglycemic subjects with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Therefore, the present work aimed to evaluate the effect of cagaita fruit juice on postprandial glycemia in dysglycemic subjects with MetS, and whether cagaita ellagitannins could be metabolized to urolithins. To evaluate glycemic effects, two different meals were consumed by volunteers (n = 12) with a 1-week interval among them. The first one consisted of white bread (50 g) plus water (300 mL) as a control; the second one, white bread (50 g) plus clarified cagaita juice (300 mL). Bioavailability was assessed in 24 h urine, after the consumption of a single amount of 300 mL of cagaita juice by healthy (n = 16) and MetS subjects (n = 7). The results showed that dysglycemic subjects with MetS presented a 53% reduction of incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of glucose, 38% reduction of insulin, 78% reduction of GIP (glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide), and 58% reduction of C-peptide (p< 0.05), after the consumption of cagaita juice along with bread, in comparison to control water. However, both GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and glucagon were not affected by cagaita juice ingestion. Concerning bioavailability, it was observed, for the first time, the metabolization of cagaita ellagitannins to urolithins by healthy and dysglycemic individuals with MetS, with a prevalence of metabotype B in both groups (44% and 42%, respectively), followed by metabotype A (37% and 29%, respectively), and metabotype 0 (19% and 29%, respectively).

C. da							Non-destructive authentication of Gourmet ground roasted coffees using NIR spectroscopy and digital images.		Food Chemistry					The growing demand for excellent-quality coffees allied with their symbolic aestheticization that add value to the products favor the adulteration practices and consequently economic losses. So, this work proposes the suitability of NIR spectroscopy and Digital Images (from CACHAS) coupled with one-class classification methods for the non-destructive authentication of Gourmet ground roasted coffees. For this, Gourmet coffees (n=44) were discriminated from Traditional (n=36) and Superior (n=10) by directly analyzing their powder without any sample preparation. Then, OC-PLS and dd-SIMCA were used to construct the models. Dd-SIMCA using offset correction for NIR and RGB histogram for CACHAS achieved the best results, correctly recognizing all the 90 samples in both the training and test sets. Therefore, the proposed methodologies can be useful for both the consumers and regulatory agencies because it confirms the elevated standards of excellence of Brazilian specialty coffees, preventing fraudulent labeling, besides following the Principles of Green Analytical Chemistry.

Impact of processing approach and storage time on bioactive and biological properties of rocket, spinach and watercress byproducts.		Foods					The high nutritional value of vegetables is well recognized, but their short shelf life and seasonal nature result in massive losses and wastes. Vegetable's byproducts are an opportunity to develop value-added ingredients, increasing food system efficiency and environmental sustainability. In the present work, pulps and powders of byproducts from rocket and spinach leaves and watercress were developed and stored for six months under freezing and vacuum conditions, respectively. After processing and storage, microbiological quality, bioactive compounds (polyphenols, carotenoids and tocopherols profiles), antioxidant capacity, and pulps viscosity were analyzed. Generally, the developed vegetable's pulps and powders were considered microbiologically safe. Although some variations after processing and storage were verified, the antioxidant activity was preserved or improved. A rich phenolic composition was also registered and maintained. During freezing, the quantitative carotenoid profile was significantly improved (mainly in rocket and spinach), while after drying, there was a significant decrease. A positive effect was verified in the vitamin E level. Both processing and storage conditions resulted in products with relevant phenolics, carotenoids and tocopherol levels, contributing to the antioxidant activity registered. Thus, this study demonstrates the potential of vegetable byproducts valorization through developing these functional ingredients bringing economic and environmental value into the food chain. © 2021 by the authors.

Technological and protective performance of LAB isolated from Serpa PDO cheese: towards selection and development of an autochthonous starter culture.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Serpa is an ovine raw milk cheese widely appreciated by the consumers. However, raw milk products may be seen with reservations in terms of safety or technological defects. To overcome that, the addition of an autochthonous starter culture may ensure the cheesemaking process optimization and microbiota dominance. In this work, the technological and protective performance of eleven lactic acid bacteria strains, isolated from Serpa Protected Designation of Origin cheese and reported as generally recognized as safe, were screened. The integration of technological and protective properties studied in the PCA plot, coupled with the proteolytic and lipolytic analysis suggested that Lb. plantarum PL1 and PL4 strains may be the best candidates. These strains showed both proteolytic and lipolytic activities, a good acidification potential, low d-lactic acid production and were well adapted to the salt and temperatures used. PL1 strain also exhibited a higher antimicrobial effect against the pathogenic bacteria studied. Although Lb. paracasei strain showed lower acidification capacity, due to their technological and protective properties, it could be combined with other more acidifying strains. As future work, it is important to establish cheese model systems to complement this screening and implement an autochthonous starter culture. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Effect of the addition of cheese powder and salt content on sensory profile, physicochemical properties and gamma-glutamyl kokumi peptides content in dry fermented sausages.		European Food Research and Technology					Cheese powder addition to dry-fermented sausage was assessed as a tool to boost flavour and reduce salt content. The effect of different type of cheese powders (mixtures of different types of hard cheeses) and salt content (standard and 40% reduction) on physicochemical and sensory characteristics of dry-fermented sausages was evaluated. Both salt and cheese powder had an effect on physicochemical parameters, whereas only salt had an effect on the sensory attributes of fermented sausages (saltiness, sourness, flavour intensity and complexity). The increase of flavour intensity and sourness when cheese powder is added might confirm the cheese powder potential as a flavour enhancer. Several gamma-glutamyl dipeptides were identified in dry-fermented sausages and cheese powders. The presence of gamma-glutamyl dipeptides in dry-fermented sausages and cheese powders suggest they might influence the kokumi perception. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.		; Lametsch, Rene/E-6174-2015; De Gobba, Cristian/M-5178-2014	Araya-Morice, Adriana/0000-0002-7813-0521; Lametsch, Rene/0000-0002-4189-806X; De Gobba, Cristian/0000-0002-2774-5876							2021	247	8	2027	2037	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03769-z					FSTA:2021-11-Sr6729

Milling and rheological properties of high amylose wheat.		Journal of Cereal Science					The technological quality of a high amylose bread wheat variety (amylose/amylopectin 1:0.7) was explored performing different milling protocols, with subsequent evaluation of the chemical composition and rheological properties of the milling fractions and recombined flours. High amylose wheat yielded a lower amount of flour (<50%) and less refined products compared to control line. Grain debranning improved flour yields, releasing more refined reduction products. The milling of high amylose wheat with a hard-wheat diagram enhanced flour yield and refining rate of products, also giving a semolina type flour that can be employed e.g. for the production of pasta and couscous. The high amylose flours are characterized by relevant levels of resistant starch (27% of total starch on average) that make them suitable for the production of functional foods in agreement with the EU Regulation 432/2012. In addition, from the experimental results, it was put in evidence that official protocols for rheological analysis of flours (gluten index, alveograph and falling number) should be adapted for high amylose wheat samples, due to the impact that the different starch composition has on dough properties, specifically on water absorption and viscosity. Overall, rheological features of high amylose wheat flours exhibited higher water absorption, stability, and altered starch pasting properties.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Genistein is naturally occurring in plants and binds to estrogen receptors. Humans are mainly exposed through diet, but the use of supplements is increasing as genistein is claimed to promote health and alleviate menopausal symptoms. We analyzed diverse uterine features in adult mice chronically fed genistein for different times. The luminal epithelium height was increased in females treated with 500 and 1000 ppm at PND 95, and the width of the outer myometrium was increased in females treated with 1000 ppm at PND 65 compared to that in controls. An increase in proliferation was noted in the inner myometrium layer of animals exposed to 300 ppm genistein at PND 185 compared to that in controls. Luminal hyperplasia was greater in the 1000 ppm group at PND 65, 95, and 185, although not statistically different from control. These results indicate that genistein may exert estrogenic activity in the uterus, without persistent harm to the organ.										2021	69	5	1693	1704	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.0c07456					FSTA:2021-06-Aj8851
J		Arce-Lopez, B.; Lizarraga, E.; Mesa, R. L. de; Gonzalez-Penas, E.							Assessment of exposure to mycotoxins in Spanish children through the analysis of their levels in plasma samples.		Toxins					In this study, we present, for the first time in Spain, the levels of 19 mycotoxins in plasma samples from healthy and sick children (digestive, autism spectrum (ASD), and attention deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) disorders) (n=79, aged 2-16). The samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (triple quadrupole) (LC-MS/MS). To detect Phase II metabolites, the samples were reanalyzed after pre-treatment with beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase. The most prevalent mycotoxin was ochratoxin A (OTA) in all groups of children, before and after enzyme treatment. In healthy children, the incidence of OTA was 92.5% in both cases and higher than in sick children before (36.7% in digestive disorders, 50% in ASD, and 14.3% in ADHD) and also after the enzymatic treatment (76.6% in digestive disorders, 50% in ASD, and 85.7% in ADHD). OTA levels increased in over 40% of healthy children after enzymatic treatment, and this increase in incidence and levels was also observed in all sick children. This suggests the presence of OTA conjugates in plasma. In addition, differences in OTA metabolism may be assumed. OTA levels are higher in healthy children, even after enzymatic treatment (mean OTA value for healthy children 3.29 ng/mL, 1.90 ng/mL for digestive disorders, 1.90 ng/mL for ASD, and 0.82 ng/mL for ADHD). Ochratoxin B appears only in the samples of healthy children with a low incidence (11.4%), always co-occurring with OTA. Sterigmatocystin (STER) was detected after enzymatic hydrolysis with a high incidence in all groups, especially in sick children (98.7% in healthy children and 100% in patients). This supports glucuronidation as a pathway for STER metabolism in children. Although other mycotoxins were studied (aflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2, and M1; T-2 and HT-2 toxins; deoxynivalenol, deepoxy-deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol; zearalenone; nivalenol; fusarenon-X; neosolaniol; and diacetoxyscirpenol), they were not detected either before or after enzymatic treatment in any of the groups of children. In conclusion, OTA and STER should be highly considered in the risk assessment of mycotoxins. Studies concerning their sources of exposure, toxicokinetics, and the relationship between plasma levels and toxic effects are of utmost importance in children. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Arcella, D.; Cascio, C.; Ruiz, J. A. G.			European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Chronic dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic.		EFSA Journal					Following an official request to EFSA from the European Commission, EFSA assessed the chronic dietary exposure to inorganic arsenic (iAs) in the European population. A total of 13,608 analytical results on iAs were considered in the current assessment (7,623 corresponding to drinking water and 5,985 to different types of food). Samples were collected across Europe between 2013 and 2018. The highest mean dietary exposure estimates at the lower bound (LB) were in toddlers (0.30 mug/kg body weight (bw) per day), and in both infants and toddlers (0.61 mug/kg bw per day) at the upper bound (UB). At the 95th percentile, the highest exposure estimates (LB-UB) were 0.58 and 1.20 mug/kg bw per day in toddlers and infants, respectively. In general, UB estimates were two to three times higher than LB estimates. The mean dietary exposure estimates (LB) were overall below the range of benchmark dose lower confidence limit (BMDL01) values of 0.3-8 mug/kg bw per day established by the EFSA Panel on Contaminants in the Food Chain in 2009. However, for the 95th percentile dietary exposure (LB), the maximum estimates for infants, toddlers and other children were within this range of BMDL01 values. Across the different age classes, the main contributors to the dietary exposure to iAs (LB) were "Rice", "Rice-based products", "Grains and grain-based products (no rice)" and "Drinking water". Different ad hoc exposure scenarios (e.g.consumption of rice-based formulae) showed dietary exposure estimates in average and for high consumers close to or within the range of BMDL01 values. The main uncertainties associated with the dietary exposure estimations refer to the impact of using the substitution method to treat the left-censored data (LB-UB differences), to the lack of information (consumption and occurrence) on some iAs-containing ingredients in specific food groups, and to the effect of food preparation on the iAs levels. Recommendations were addressed to improve future dietary exposure assessments to iAs. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

The effect of pulsed electric fields pre-treatment on the volatile and phenolic profiles of Merlot grape musts at different winemaking stages and the sensory characteristics of the finished wines.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					This study investigated the effect of pulsed electric fields (PEF) applied at different electric field strengths (up to 41.5 kV/cm) and energy inputs (up to 49.4 kJ/kg) on the volatile and phenolic profiles of Merlot grapes at different stages of winemaking. Immediately after PEF treatment, greater amounts of anthocyanins and phenolics (e.g., catechin) were extracted while 2-hexenal (green aroma) was detected in lower concentrations in PEF-treated musts. At completion of alcoholic and malolactic fermentations, high-energy PEF treatment generally produced wines with increased anthocyanins, stilbenoids, hydroxycinnamic and hydroxybenzoic acids. A trained sensory panel assessed the sensory attributes of the finished wines using descriptive analysis. It was found that those Merlot wines vinified with PEF-treated grapes possessed higher intensities of blackcurrant flavour and odour. The intensity of spice flavour in the Merlot wines also differed significantly between the wines. Overall, PEF treatment has the capability to provide winemakers the means to tailor the extraction of phenolic compounds towards the creation of red wines with distinct sensory characteristics.

Fragrance addition improves visitation by honeybees and fruit quality in kiwifruit (Actinidia deliciosa).		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Kiwifruit is an important horticultural crop all over the world and its development is important in Argentina. This dioecious crop has a short blooming period with nectarless flowers, and its fruit production depends on cross-pollination. Here, we tested whether kiwifruit quality increases by using honeybees exposed to female flowers treated with an artificial fragrance. The three experimental treatments were: A, sprinkled female flowers with 1:1 sugar syrup+ Lavandula hybrida extract solution (a new attractant substance especially developed for this study named Lavandin Grosso); B, sprinkled female flowers with 1:1 water + sugar syrup (female flowers with additional sugar syrup reward); C (control; female flowers exposed to honeybees). Results. The results showed a higher number of visits of honeybees to the female flowers sprinkled with the attractant substance, Lavandin Grosso, as well as higher fruit quality (weight, number of seeds, regularity in fruit size). Conclusion. Our study demonstrates the potential of fragrance-treated flowers to improve yield production in kiwifruit. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

Chauhan							Effect of slaughter age and post-mortem days on meat quality of longissimus and semimembranosus muscles of Boer goats.		Meat Science					This study investigated the effects of age of animal and days post-mortem (PM) on meat quality of Boer goats. Twenty-four (24) wether Boer goats of two age groups (2YO group: 2 years old and 9MO: 6-9 months, with 12 animals/group) were slaughtered in a commercial processing plant. The pH @Temp18 was estimated to be above 6 in both age groups with higher (P< 0.01) values in 2YO goats. The PM storage for 14 days reduced the shear force in both age groups (P< 0.01). 2YO goat muscles (longissimus and semimembranosus) exhibited higher (P< 0.01) Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance values (TBARS), indicating increased lipid oxidation. Glycogen (P < 0.01) and lactate content (20 min post-slaughter) in longissimus of 9MO were lower compared to 2YO, and total muscle glycogen concentration was lower (P< 0.01) in both age groups below the threshold levels. Hence, as hypothesized, age and days PM proved to play crucial roles on Boer meat quality.

J		Archana Jain; Soumitra Soni; Krishna K. Verma							Combined liquid phase microextraction and fiber-optics-based cuvetteless micro-spectrophotometry for sensitive determination of ammonia in water and food samples by the indophenol reaction.		Food Chemistry					The Berthelot reaction for ammonia is revisited with the aim of miniaturization and addressing interferences as encountered with food and water samples. Headspace single drop microextraction of ammonia in phosphoric acid served to attain selectivity in complex matrices, and liquid-liquid microextraction of red or blue indophenol species into 1-octanol-isooctane (60:40, v/v) resulted into high sensitivity. Fiber-optics-based cuvetteless micro-spectrophotometry has been used for colorimetric determination on microliter volumes of extract. The linear dynamic range, limit of detection and enrichment factor have been found to be 0.2-3 mg kg-1, 0.14 mg kg-1 and 38, respectively, measuring red species for milk, cheese and beer (4.9-5.5% error; 4.8-6.3% RSD; n=5); and 5-400 g L-1, 0.4 g L-1 and 137, respectively, measuring blue species for water samples (3.3-5.7% error; 3.6-6.8% RSD; n=5).

Relative availability of metabolizable methionine from 2 ruminally protected sources of methionine fed to lactating dairy cattle.		Journal of Dairy Science					Our objective was to evaluate the lactational responses of dairy cows to methionine provided from 2 ruminally protected sources of methionine activity. Twenty-one Holstein dairy cows [11 primiparous (634 kg of body weight, 140 d in milk) and 10 second-parity (670 kg of body weight, 142 d in milk)] were assigned to a treatment sequence in 4 replicated 5 * 5 Latin squares plus 1 cow, with 14-d periods. Treatments were as follows: control; 7.5 or 15 g/d of a ruminally protected product of 2-hydoxy-4-methylthio-butyric acid (NTP-1401; Novus International Inc., St. Charles, MO); or 7.5 or 15 g/d of a ruminally protected dl-methionine product (Smartamine M; Adisseo, Alpharetta, GA). The diet was predicted to meet metabolizable protein and energy requirements. Diets contained 16.1% crude protein, and the control diet was predicted to be deficient in metabolizable methionine (1.85% of metabolizable protein) but sufficient in lysine (6.8% of metabolizable protein). Feed intake and milk yield were measured on d 11 to 14. Blood was collected on d 14. Dry matter intake, milk yield, energy-corrected milk, milk fat yield and percentage, and efficiencies of milk and energy-corrected milk yield were not affected by treatment. Milk protein percentage and milk protein yield increased linearly with supplementation, without differences between methionine sources or interactions between source and level. Linear regressions of milk protein percentage and milk protein yield against supplement amount within source led to slope ratios (NTP-1401:Smartamine M) of 95% for protein percentage and 84% for protein yield, with no differences between sources for increasing milk protein. Plasma methionine concentrations were increased linearly by methionine supplementation; the increase was greater for Smartamine M than for NTP-1401. Plasma d-methionine was increased only by Smartamine M. Plasma 2-hydoxy-4-methylthio-butyric acid was increased only by NTP-1401. Our data demonstrated that supplementation with these methionine sources can improve milk protein percentage and yield, and the 2 methionine sources did not differ in their effect on lactation performance or milk composition.

Food and Bioprocess Technology					The aim of this study was to prepare Plantago major seed gum (PMSG)-based nanocomposite active films by the addition of fennel essential oil (FEO) as active agent and nanoclay as reinforcing additive. The effect of FEO (0-8%) and nanoclay (0-5%) on the properties of PMSG films was evaluated using the response surface methodology. Moisture absorption, water vapor permeability, and water contact angle of films decreased by increasing FEO content. Nanoclay had increasing effect on opacity and mechanical properties of films. The films with medium values of nanoclay and FEO had the highest antioxidant activity. Optimized films (FEO: 4.63%; nanoclay: 2.70%) were further studied for structural and antimicrobial characterization. Optimum film had higher antibacterial activity against S. aureus compared to E. coli. The FT-IR, FE-SEM, and XRD analyses indicated that structural and morphological properties of optimum film were better than sample of run 13 that had the highest amount of FEO. At the next step, the optimized films were used for packaging of local butter. The butter without packaging showed the highest peroxide value, acidity, and color difference during 40 days of storage. But the optimum film had significant effect on these values. This research indicated that PMSG-based FEO-activated and nanoclay-reinforced films had strong potential for using as active packaging for fatty foods such as local butter. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	12	2302	2322	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02724-w					FSTA:2022-04-Pg1441
J		Ardiansyah:Azhary Suhandoko; Dennis:Chia-Bin Chen; Shang-Ho Yang							Meat Traceability: Traditional Market Shoppers Preferences and Willingness-to-Pay for Additional Information in Taiwan.		Foods					Due to food scandals that shocked the retailer markets, traceability systems were advocated to regain consumers confidence and trust. However, while traceability systems can be more easily explored in modern markets, almost no traceability system can be found in traditional markets in Taiwan, especially when buying meat products. This study explored the preference and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for traceability information of pork products in traditional markets in Taiwan. The random utility theory (RUT) with the contingent valuation method (CVM) was adopted to examine the total of 1420 valid responses in Taiwan. Results show that 80% of traditional market consumers are willing to pay more for traceability information of pork products. Specifically, when consumers (1) know the market price of pork, (2) do not often buy food in the traditional market, (3) live in south or north regions of Taiwan, (4) have a flexible buying schedule, (5) are aware of food safety due to frequently accessing health-related content through media, or (6) think pork grading is very important, they would tend to choose meat products with traceability information. The implication of this study suggests that there is an urgent desire for food safety labeling and traceability information system in traditional markets in Taiwan. Especially, those who usually shop in the higher-price markets are willing to pay the most for this traceability information. © 2021 by the authors.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Successful introduction of insect consumption to a reluctant US population requires novel insect-based foods that are responsive to consumers' expectations of sensory quality. Based on our "product appropriateness" data, snack crackers were formulated with increasing levels of cricket powder (0%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) in substitution of whole-wheat flour. Colour, texture, flavour and overall perceptions of snack crackers were evaluated by 150 US consumers in terms of preference (2-alternative choice), degree of liking (9-point scale) and acceptability (yes/no). Flavour liking was most highly correlated with overall liking (r=0.93). Instrumental analyses indicated that increasing cricket powder resulted in darker and harder crackers, negatively impacting colour and texture preference at 5% and 15% cricket powder addition, respectively. Snack crackers remained acceptable at 15% wheat flour substitution (80% acceptability; mean overall liking=5.5). However, to promote future consumption, an upper limit of 7.9% cricket powder addition is recommended until sensory quality can be improved. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	8	4070	4080	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.15032					FSTA:2021-11-Mq7104

Evaluation of craft beers through the direct determination of amino acids by capillary electrophoresis and principal component analysis.		Food Chemistry					The composition of beer wort in terms of amino acid (AA) content affects the final product quality, once it is related to the vitality of yeast during the initial exponential growth phase and throughout fermentation. The objective of this work was the use of a capillary zone electrophoresis method with UV-vis detection in association with Principal Component (Data) Analysis for craft beer classification. Cysteine, histidine, phenylalanine, lysine, tryptophan and arginine were the monitored AAs in wort and finished beer, which were extracted through cation exchange resin. Good differentiation among samples according to their production was obtained, showing a profile of AAs (-1) for each wort, which can be used as indicator of the quality of a beer. One of the samples had the mashing step monitored, showing an increasing profile in the concentrations of AAs (6.5-55 g mL-1), which can be explained by the protein cleavage.

J		Arefi, A.; Sturm, B.; Gersdorff, G. von; Nasirahmadi, A.; Hensel, O.							Vis-NIR hyperspectral imaging along with Gaussian process regression to monitor quality attributes of apple slices during drying.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Hyperspectral images (400-1700 nm) of apple slices during the hot-air drying were acquired. The fusion of spectral data and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) successfully predicted vitamin C (R-squared = 0.93 and RMSE = 0.57 mg/100 g fresh-weigh), SSC (R-squared 0.99 and RMSE 2.47%), moisture content (R-squared 1 and RMSE = 0.89%), and shrinkage (R-squared 0.98 and RMSE = 3.66% for shrinkage). The chromaticity was likewise well predicted, however, GPR models failed to predict rehydration ratio and total phenolic content. As hyperspectral systems are expensive and computationally intensive, their possible substitution with multispectral systems was investigated by finding optimal wavelengths. In this context, 1450 nm and 980 nm were singled out by using a combination of filter-based, wrapper-based, and embedded wavelength selection algorithms. The corresponding prediction accuracies for vitamin C, SSC, moisture content, and shrinkage were almost as good as those of the full spectrum. In the case of chromaticity, it is suggested to use a color camera as most of the efficient wavelengths laid in the visible range. These results indicate potential replacement of hyperspectral imaging by much simpler and lower-cost imaging sensors by which the way will be paved towards the appearance of smart dryers.

J		Arellano, S.; Law, B.; Friedman, M.; Sadhana Ravishankar							Essential oil microemulsions inactivate antibiotic-resistant Salmonella Newport and spoilage bacterium Lactobacillus casei on Iceberg lettuce during 28-day storage at 4 °C.		Food Control					The produce industry commonly uses chlorine to wash vegetables during post-harvest practices. However, chlorine has disadvantages because it is not sustainable to the environment, is not user-friendly, is corrosive to equipment, and loses efficacy in the presence of organic matter. Hence, alternatives to wash sanitizers are required to better meet the needs of the industry. Essential oil-based antimicrobial microemulsions in the wash water were evaluated for their efficacy against antibiotic-resistant Salmonella enterica serovar Newport and spoilage bacterium Lactobacillus casei on Iceberg lettuce. The microemulsions that were assessed included oregano oil, lemongrass oil, and cinnamon oil along with a plant-based emulsifier for improved solubility of the oil in water. Iceberg lettuce (10 g) was washed thoroughly and inoculated with Lactobacilli casei (6.0 log colony-forming units (CFU) /g) or Salmonella Newport (6.0 log CFU/g). The Iceberg leaves were separately treated with 0.1%, 0.3%, or 0.5% of the microemulsions, 50 ppm chlorine, and 3% hydrogen peroxide, stored at 4 °C, observed, and analyzed for surviving populations of both bacteria on days 0, 3, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. The efficacies of the antimicrobials were dependent on concentration and storage-time. The use of microemulsions resulted in a 2.3-4.37 log CFU/g reduction in the Salmonella population at various time points during days 0-28. They were also effective against Lactobacillus, resulting in 0.11-4.25 log CFU/g reduction during storage at days 0-28. The data on visual observation of treated leaves summarized that the 0.1% oregano oil microemulsion had the best visual appeal in Iceberg leaves inoculated with S. Newport and the 0.5% lemongrass oil microemulsion showed improvement in reduced browning of the Iceberg leaves inoculated with Lactobacillus casei. This study demonstrates the potential of essential oil microemulsions to inactivate foodborne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria on Iceberg lettuce, thus providing effective produce decontamination strategies.

J		Arena, A.; Zoccali, M.; Trozzi, A.; Tranchida, P. Q.; Mondello, L.							Occurrence of mineral oil hydrocarbons in omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements.		Foods					Omega-3 fatty acid dietary supplements have become increasingly popular with consumers due to their multiple health benefits. In this study, the presence of mineral oil hydrocarbons (MOH) was investigated in seventeen commercial samples of such supplements, characterized by different formulations. The analyses were performed using on-line liquid chromatography-gas chromatography (with flame ionization detection), which is considered the most efficient method for the determination of MOH in foodstuffs. Analyte transfer was performed by using the retention gap technique, with partially concurrent solvent evaporation. Various degrees of mineral oil saturated hydrocarbon contamination (from 2.4 ppm to 375.7 ppm) were found, with an average value of 49.9 ppm. Different C-number range contaminations were determined, with the >C25-≤C35 range always found with an average value of 26.9 ppm. All samples resulted free of mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons, except for two samples in which a contamination was found at the 9.9 and 6.6 ppm levels, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Arena, E.; Rizzo, V.; Licciardello, F.; Fallico, B.; Muratore, G.							Effects of light exposure, bottle colour and storage temperature on the quality of Malvasia delle Lipari sweet wine.		Foods					The influence of light exposure, bottle color and storage temperature on the quality parameters of Malvasia delle Lipari (MdL) sweet wine were investigated. Wine samples bottled in clear-colored (colorless, green and amber) glass were stored under different artificial lighting conditions, in order to simulate the retail environment (one cool-white, fluorescent lamp) and to perform an accelerated test (four and six cool-white, fluorescent lamps). The storage temperature was kept constant (25 °C) for the first 90 days of the experiment and then samples were monitored for up to 180 days at higher temperatures (30, 35 and 40 °C). The principal enological parameters, total phenols, color, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) and 2-furaldehyde (2F) contents were studied. The shelf-life test pointed out minimum variations of the basic chemical parameters, while the quality attributes most affected by lighting were color, together with HMF and 2F levels which, hence, can be considered as indicators of the severity of storage conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect of pre-fermentative maceration and fining agents on protein stability, macromolecular, and phenolic composition of albarino white wines: comparative efficiency of chitosan, k-carrageenan and bentonite as heat stabilisers.		Foods					In this work, the effect of pre-fermentative skin maceration (PFSM) on the chemical composition of the macromolecular fraction, polysaccharides and proteins, phenolic compounds, chromatic characteristics, and protein stability of Albarino monovarietal white wines was studied. PFSM increased the extraction of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides and reduced the extraction of pathogenesis-related proteins (PRPs). PFSM wine showed significantly higher protein instability. Sodium and calcium bentonites were used for protein stabilisation of wines obtained with PFSM (+PFSM) and without PFSM (-PFSM), and their efficiencies compared to fungal chitosan (FCH) and k-carrageenan. K-Carrageenan reduced the content of PRPs and the protein instability in both wines, and it was more efficient than sodium and calcium bentonites. FCH was unable to heat stabilise both wines, and PRPs levels remained unaltered. On the other hand, FCH decreased the levels of wine polysaccharides by 60%. Sodium and calcium bentonite also decreased the levels of wine polysaccharides although to a lower extent (16% to 59%). K-Carrageenan did not affect the wine polysaccharide levels. Overall, k-carrageenan is suitable for white wine protein stabilisation, having a more desirable impact on the wine macromolecular fraction than the other fining agents, reducing the levels of the wine PRPs without impacting polysaccharide composition. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ares, G.; Vidal, L.							Commentary on "The future of consumer neuroscience in food research" by Niedziela and Ambroze.		Food Quality and Preference					Neuroscience has the potential to allow us to more fully understand eating behavior by providing information that is inaccessible by conventional methods. However, it cannot be expected to solve all the problems sensory and consumer researchers face when trying to understand consumer food-related decisions. In the present work, we provide a commentary on the opinion paper by Niedziela & Ambroze. We urge sensory and consumer researchers to get familiar with neuroscience methods, their potential and limitations, as well as to engage in more interdisciplinary research to validate the application of neuroscience tools in the field.

J		Ares, G.; Ha, B.; Jaeger, S. R.							Consumer attitudes to vertical farming (indoor plant factory with artificial lighting) in China, Singapore, UK, and USA: a multi-method study.		Food Research International					Major changes are needed both with regard to what we eat and how food is produced. The latter is the focus of the present research, specifically the rise of controlled environment agriculture. In this context, empirical research is presented on consumer attitudes to vertical farming (VF) (i.e., indoor plant factory with artificial lighting), conducted in four countries (USA, UK, Singapore, and China) using online surveys (637-683 participants per country with matched gender and age group distributions). A multi-method research approach was used, including a novel methodology of text highlighting, which requires that participants read a descriptive text about VF with mentions of pros and cons and use highlighter functions to select aspects of the text that they "like" and "dislike". Based on the information provided in the text, attitudes towards VF were largely positive in the four countries. The characteristics of VF that aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals were identified as key drivers of positive attitudes (i.e., higher yield, reduction of carbon emissions, and securing access to food). On the other hand, high energy use and premium prices contributed to negative attitudes about VF. Although the majority of participants responded to the text with an overall positive attitude towards VF, there were smaller groups of participants in every country who expressed a negative or neutral/ambivalent attitude. These between-segment differences were larger than cross-cultural differences, although the latter did exist, particularly for selected aspects of VF. For example, Chinese participants tended to be the least negative about the use of robots to help planting and harvesting. Future research is needed to understand consumer responses to aspects VF not covered in the text (e.g., powering VF with renewable energy, product range), and consumer insights about VF should be sought in other countries.

International Dairy Journal					The beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) from Kluyveromyces lactis was immobilised in calcium alginate spheres and a new integrated process was investigated using hydrolysis and ultrafiltration of whey. Samples of bovine, caprine, and bubaline whey were treated. The effects of pH, temperature, storage and thermal stability were studied for the free and immobilised beta-gal. For both free and immobilised enzyme, optimum pH and temperature was found to be 7.0 and 35 °C, respectively. Michaelis-Menten constant (Km) was 2.86 and 4.37 mm for the free and immobilised enzyme, respectively. Reuse, storage, and thermal stability of the beta-gal were increased by immobilisation. The integrated hydrolysis-UF resulted in similar values of protein concentration and permeate flux to that obtained by independent UF. The proposed hydrolysis-UF process was demonstrated to be efficient in reducing the operational time by combining two operations in addition to the enzyme reuse. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Science & Nutrition					In this study, the effects of adding Gaz-angubin at three different levels (5%, 10%, and 15% w/v) and bitter orange peel extract with three different concentrations (0.025%, 0.050%, and 0.075% w/v) on selected characteristics of the flavored milk were investigated during 10-day storage at 4 °C. The results showed that increasing the level of Gaz-angubin and bitter orange peel extract increased viscosity, antioxidant activity, and total polyphenol content, decreased total microbial count, and improved the sensory characteristics of the flavored milk (p<.05). Generally, the flavored milk sample containing 15% Gaz-angubin and 0.075% bitter orange peel extract was selected as the best treatment. © 2020 The Authors.

J		Arghavan Mirani; Mohammad Goli							Production of the eggplant-fiber incorporated cupcake and evaluating its chemical, textural and colorimetric properties over a ten-day storage time.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Optimal-formulas a, and b including 12%, 8% eggplant-fiber replacement with wheat flour, 71%, 57% whole-egg, and 70%, 70% sugar (based on wheat flour+ eggplant-fiber weight), respectively, were designed using RSM. According to the results, the optimal-formulas, due to the presence of eggplant-fiber, contain fewer calories, more moisture, ash, antioxidant activity, and fiber content than the control. The optimal-formulas a and b in terms of color (a*, b*, L*, and Chroma indices) were significantly different from the control and the control had a brighter color due to the increased sugar content. In the optimal-formulas, color changes gave more intense colors than the control. As for textural properties, after 10 days, the optimal-formulas were similar to each other; however, they were significantly different from the control (except in the springiness factor). Overall, the optimal-formula b had greater similarities (such as porosity) to the control. Practical applications. Response surface methodology suggested two optimal-formulas A and B. The optimal-formulas A & B including 12% & 8% replacing eggplant-fiber with wheat flour, 71% & 57% whole-egg, and 70% & 70% sugar (based on wheat flour+ eggplant-fiber weight), respectively. Eggplant decreased the cupcake calories, whereas increased the cupcake fiber, ash, and antioxidant activity, consequently nutritional values. In terms of the textural properties except for springiness, after 10 days, the optimal-formulas were similar to each other; however, they were significantly different from the control. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15311					FSTA:2021-08-Jq10415

Lipidome changes, with a focus on phospholipids, due to feeding systems and processing in goat milk.		Food Chemistry					We evaluated the effects of processing-pasteurization and yoghurt manufacturing-on some health-promoting lipidome components in milk from two feeding treatments-brushland grazing or hay-feeding in confinement-in dairy goats. The contents of fat and protein were higher, and of urea, lower, in grazing goats. Fatty acid composition-at the exception of saturated fatty acids-was affected by dietary management and milk processing. Phospholipid contents was lower in confined goats, with little effect for processing. The phospholipid-to-triglyceride ratio was decreased by pasteurization. Sensitivity to pasteurization of phospholipid composition differed between feeding treatments. The percentage of sphingomyelin increased following pasteurization, with no response for fermentation to yoghurt. These results can be exploited to modulate health-promoting fats in dairy products.

J		Arian Amirvaresi; Nastaran Nikounezhad; Maryam Amirahmadi; Bahram Daraei; Hadi Parastar							Comparison of near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy based on chemometrics for saffron authentication and adulteration detection.		Food Chemistry					In this work, the potential of near-infrared (NIR) and mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy along with chemometrics was investigated for authentication and adulteration detection of Iranian saffron samples. First, authentication of one-hundred saffron samples was examined by principal component analysis (PCA). The results showed the NIR spectroscopy can better predict the origin of samples than the MIR. Next, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was developed to detect four common plant-derived adulterants (i.e., saffron style, calendula, safflower, and rubia). In all cases, PLS-DA classification figures of merit in terms of sensitivity, specificity, error rate and accuracy were satisfactory for both NIR and MIR datasets. The built models were then successfully validated using test set and also commercial samples. Finally, partial least squares regression (PLSR) was used to estimate the amount of adulteration. In this case, only NIR showed a good performance with regression coefficients (R2) in range of 0.95-0.99.

J		Arianna Dick; Xiuping Dong; Bhesh Bhandari; Sangeeta Prakash							The role of hydrocolloids on the 3D printability of meat products.		Food Hydrocolloids					The role of food hydrocolloids on the 3D printability of meat products is discussed by evaluating the key rheological properties of the meat paste or "ink" in each stage of the 3D printing process, namely extrusion, recovery, deposition, and post-processing. The effect of hydrocolloids on the yield stress, viscosity, shear-thinning behaviour, shear recovery, storage modulus, and loss tangent of different meat-based inks and its repercussion on the extrudability, filament characterization, shape fidelity and/or shape stability of the 3D printed meat products is assessed. Thickeners enhance the viscosity of the paste for ease of initial and continuous extrusion, and consistency of the printing result. Gelling agents contribute to the formation of viscoelastic systems with varying strength, beneficial for shape fidelity and stability. Therefore, understandings the solubility, heat resistance and stability of the hydrocolloids used is imperative for the post-processing feasibility of 3D printed meat products.

Salting-out induced liquid-liquid microextraction: an environmentally friendly approach to preservative determination in food samples.		Food Analytical Methods					The salting-out induced liquid-liquid microextraction technique was properly evaluated for preservative determination in processed food samples. In the best conditions, 0.5 g sample and 4.5 mL acetate buffer, at pH 4.2, were extracted with 1 mL acetonitrile, followed by agitation, addition of 2 g MgSO4, a new agitation step, and centrifugation. Afterwards, the extract was diluted with ultrapure water and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Correlation coefficients above 0.99, LOQs between 0.03 and 0.07 mg kg-1, and recoveries between 80 and 103%, with RSD≤11%, were achieved. When applied to preservative determination in food samples, the method under evaluation provided similar results to those obtained by a previously validated one. Finally, this method is a good alternative to determining preservatives in food samples, with the advantages of being greener, cheaper, and faster than the official ones. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	8	1625	1636	1936-976X				10.1007/s12161-021-01989-3					FSTA:2022-04-Ge1606
J		Arias, R. A.; Delgado, C.; Keim, J. P.; Gandarillas, M.							Use of the Comprehensive Climate Index to estimate heat stress response of grazing dairy cows in a temperate climate region.		Journal of Dairy Research					The aim of the study was to assess the effect of the summer thermal environment on physiological responses, behaviour, milk production and its composition on grazing dairy cows in a temperate climate region, according to the stage of lactation. Twenty-nine Holstein Friesian multiparous cows were randomly selected and divided into two groups, according to the days in milk, as mid-lactation (99 to 170 d in milk, n = 15) and late lactation (225 to 311 d in milk, n = 14). The comprehensive climate index (CCI) was used to classify the hour of each day as thermoneutral or heat stress, considering a threshold value of CCI of 20°C. Data were collected for 16 d (summer 2017) and analysed as a completely randomized 2 * 2 factorial arrangement with repeated measurements over time. Vaginal temperature increased with CCI ≥ 20°C. Respiration rates were dependent on the thermal condition, regardless of days in milk. There was an interaction between the time of day and the CCI category for activity and rumination. Grazing activity decreased by 17.6% but lying down, standing, and shaded animals increased by 1.6, 9.8, and 6.3% respectively when CCI ≥ 20°C. Over 80% of cows presented a panting score ≥1. However, milk production and composition (fat, protein, and lactose concentrations as well as somatic cell count) were not affected by the thermal condition, although there was a numerical (non-significant) decrease in afternoon milk protein concentration on days with CCI ≥ 20°C, while urea in milk increased. In conclusion, thermal condition challenged grazing dairy cows' behaviour and physiology independent of the stage of lactation but had little or no effect on milk production. © The Author(s), 2021.

J		Arias-Martin, M.; Haidukowski, M.; Farinos, G. P.; Patino, B.							Role of Sesamia nonagrioides and Ostrinia nubilalis as vectors of Fusarium spp. and contribution of corn borer-resistant Bt maize to mycotoxin reduction.		Toxins					Maize expressing Cry1Ab insecticidal toxin (Bt maize) is an effective method to control Sesamia nonagrioides and Ostrinia nubilalis, the most damaging corn borers of southern Europe. In this area, maize is prone to Fusarium infections, which can produce mycotoxins that pose a serious risk to human and animal health, causing significant economic losses in the agrifood industry. To investigate the influence of corn borer damage on the presence of Fusarium species and their mycotoxins, Bt maize ears and insect-damaged ears of non-Bt maize were collected from commercial fields in three Bt maize growing areas in Spain, and differences in contamination were assessed. Additionally, larvae of both borer species were collected to evaluate their role as vectors of these molds. Non-Bt maize ears showed significantly higher presence of F. verticillioides, F. proliferatum, and F. subglutinans than Bt maize ears. For the first time, Fusarium species have been isolated from larvae of the two species. The most frequently found mycotoxins in ears were fumonisins, with non-Bt ears being significantly more contaminated than those of Bt maize. High levels of fumonisins were shown to correlate with the occurrence of corn borers in the ear and the presence of F. verticillioides and F. proliferatum. © 2021 by the authors.

Insights on the role of acetaldehyde and other aldehydes in the odour and tactile nasal perception of red wine.		Food Chemistry					Wine models with or without a dearomatised and lyophilized red wine extract containing a young red aroma base (control) plus one vector with one or several aroma compounds (unsaturated-aldehydes, saturated-aldehydes, benzaldehyde, isoamyl-alcohol, methoxypyrazines and (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one) were prepared. Models were spiked with increasing amounts of acetaldehyde whose headspace concentrations were controlled. Odour and nasal chemesthesic properties were assessed by a trained sensory panel. Results confirm the contribution of the different players, notably isoamyl-alcohol, (Z)-1,5-octadien-3-one, benzaldehyde and methoxypyrazines, to wine aroma and tactile nasal characteristics and demonstrate that acetaldehyde levels play an outstanding role in their modulation. At low levels, it can play positive roles in some specific aromatic contexts, while at higher levels, enhance the negative effects associated to the generic presence of other aldehydes (saturated, unsaturated and Strecker aldehydes) by enhancing "green vegetable" notes and "itching" character and the "burning" effects linked to high levels of isoamyl alcohol.

In this study, cleaned, dried, and powdered bones yielded 31.40.6% calcium content. The meat residues were hydrolyzed to obtain over a hundred distinctive peptides, which were analyzed using LC-MS/MS and the SpirPep web-based tool. The peptides were rich in Glu, Asp, Lys, Gly and Leu, and also exhibited diverse bioactivities, among them primarily inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and angiotensin-converting enzyme. Calcium chelation assay determined the peptides to bind calcium at 235.720.0 mg/g peptide-calcium chelate. Caco-2 cells treated with the chelate at calcium concentrations of 0-10 mM exhibited enhanced absorption relative to CaCl2. This demonstrates that calcium and chelating peptides generated from the same byproduct can produce peptide-calcium chelate, a potential ingredient in functional foods.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Numerous researches have been still carried out for bakery products to improve their technological and nutritional properties. A well-balanced technological properties and nutritional value is needed to attract consumers. This study investigated the substitution of taro flour for both wheat flour cake (WFC) and gluten free flour cake (GFC) formulation. Taro flour was used as an alternative flour type for WFCs and especially GFCs, due to its nutritional components. Cake batter rheology, cake quality and some nutritional properties were determined and compared with those of control cakes. Significant effect was observed in the higher substitution of taro flour (25%) with wheat flour in terms of storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G). For gluten free formulation, gradual increment for G′ value and notable reduction of damping factor (tan delta) was observed with higher substitution value ranged from 12.5 to 25%. The substitution of taro flour up to 25% into GFC formulation cause no significant increase in hardness value (p > 0.05). Total color difference (DeltaE) in the crust and crumb characteristics were not detected for WFC significantly (p > 0.05). The highest DeltaE values were obtained for both crust and crumb colour characteristics from substitution level of 18.7% and 25% in GFC formulation (p < 0.05). Sensorial evaluation showed that addition of taro flour up to 25% provided similar quality attributes when compared with control cakes in terms of general acceptability. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Comparing nutritional and digestibility aspects of sustainable proteins using the INFOGEST digestion protocol.		Journal of Functional Foods					We studied several sustainable alternative protein concentrates and a whey protein concentrate as reference, to determine their protein composition, digestibility and quality using the harmonized INFOGEST static protocol. The proteins concentrates were analyzed to determine their conversion factor, degree of hydrolysis, true ileal digestibility, in vitro digestible indispensable amino acid score (IVDIAAS) and total absorbable amino acids and total essential amino acids. The results revealed that whey, blood plasma concentrate and yeast protein concentrate have a high mean true ileal indispensable amino acid in vitro digestibility (91.1-85.8%), closely followed by corn, pea, potato and proteins derived from lesser meal worms (ranging between 82.5 and 77.9%). Mycoprotein gave a much lower score in the mass balance, so that its other results could not be interpreted as being reliable. Whey, potato, blood plasma and yeast protein concentrates ranked highest in IVDIAAS (between 119 and 97.2), followed by lesser meal worm and pea (between 73.8 and 57.8) with corn protein concentrate having the lowest IVDIAAS due to underrepresentation of lysine. The method and data presented in this paper can form a start for further applying the INFOGEST in vitro digestion protocol to evaluate protein quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Results of an interlaboratory comparison of a liquid chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry method for the determination of 13C/12C ratios of saccharides in honey.		Journal of AOAC International					Background. Stable carbon isotope analysis of sugars in honey by LC-isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) is a useful tool for detecting adulteration of honey with extraneous sugar. Purity criteria based on13C/12C ratios of saccharides in honey, determined by LC-IRMS of a large number of authentic honey samples, have been elaborated. However, no interlaboratory comparison (ILC) has yet been performed to estimate the precision of the method under reproducibility conditions. Objective. To address this knowledge gap an ILC involving 14 laboratories and using six honey samples was conducted. Methods. The participants were allowed to use their LC-IRMS-based method of choice for sample preparation and compound separation. Results. The precision figures were estimated according to ISO 5725:1994. The repeatability relative standard deviation (RSDr) for the determination of delta13C values of fructose and glucose varied between 0.3 and 0.5%, with 0.3 and 1.0% for disaccharides, and 0.7 and 2.8% for trisaccharides. The RSDR varied between 0.8 and 1.8% for the monosaccharides, 1.0 and 1.5% for disaccharides, and 1.4 and 2.8% for trisaccharides. Conclusion. Based on the obtained precision data the LC-IRMS method for the determination of13C/12C ratios of saccharides in honey was considered fit for the conformity assessment of honey with established purity criteria. Highlights. Precision estimates for a LC-IRMS method to determine13C/12C ratios of saccharides in honey were obtained through an ILC. The data created can form the basis for the standardization of the method by interested standards developing organizations for use in official control. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2021.

J		Arif Khan, M.; Mahsa Moradipour; Obeidullah, M.; Abdul Quader, A. K. M.							Heat and mass transport analysis of the drying of freshwater fishes by a forced convective air-dryer.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The drying behavior of different freshwater fishes (with/without scales) is investigated using a simple convective heated air dryer. Drying processes are analyzed to study the kinetics of drying, shrinkage dependent variable effective diffusivity, convective heat and mass transport, and the energy aspect of drying. Among the drying kinetic models, Hasibuan-Daud and Haghi-Angiz-I models produce the best fit for fishes with scales and Hii model produces the best fit for fish without scales. Diffusion analysis performed based on simplified solution of Fick's diffusion equation shows higher effective diffusivity for fish without scales, proving additional barrier from scales (for fish with scales) that need to be considered during dryer design. Calculated instantaneous heat and mass transfer coefficients (different for fish with or without scales) also agree with this observation, accentuating the difference based on scales. Drying process for all fishes obeys the heat-mass transfer correlation. Estimated parameters such as effective diffusivity (0.2-1 *10-9 m2/s) and convective heat and mass transfer coefficients (7-14W/m2/K and 2.8-4.5 *10-6 m/s, respectively) can be utilized in designing different fish drying systems. Average and instantaneous total energy consumption, specific moisture extraction ratio, and specific energy consumption are evaluated in order to provide a comprehensive picture of the drying process. Practical Applications. Fresh-and salt-water fishes account for major sources of protein-rich food for substantial parts of the population in underdeveloped and developing nations. To circumvent the wastage associated with microbial contaminations during prolific seasons, fish drying has been widely employed as a way of preserving this perishable food. Convective drying of agricultural products as well as marine foods is a commonly employed drying method for food preservation. This study investigates the drying behavior of three different freshwater fishes using an in-house constructed forced convective air dryer. The experimental drying characteristics and estimated parameters by model fitting during fish drying will be particularly applicable in the wide field of fish drying. The outcome of this study can also be utilized for more effectively designing and evaluating low-cost convective fish dryers. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	1			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13574					FSTA:2021-04-Rc1624

Differentiating Pakistani long-grain rice grown inside and outside the accepted Basmati Himalayan geographical region using a "one-class" multi-element chemometric model.		Food Control					"Basmati" is the name used for a class of rice comprising a few defined varieties grown in several defined regions of the Indo-Gangetic Plains in India and Pakistan. Due to its highly valued qualities Basmati rice is sold at a premium price, which makes it susceptible to fraud due to economically motivated adulteration. Unscrupulous producers or distributors can increase profits by mislabeling rice grown outside the recognized Basmati region and passing it off as Basmati rice. Therefore, the authentication of the geographical origin of Basmati rice is of high importance for the entire Basmati rice supply chain and is becoming increasingly so due to pending applications for Geographical Indication (GI) status with the European Commission. Although elemental analysis has been applied previously for the authentication of rice, only a few studies have assessed the application of elemental analysis for the authentication of the geographical origin of Basmati rice. This study demonstrates the high potential of the combination of elemental analysis and data-driven soft independent modelling by class analogy (DD-SIMCA) for the differentiation of Pakistani rice grown inside and outside the recognized Basmati growing region, thus permitting the "geographical component" of Basmati rice authenticity to be verified. The achieved sensitivity and specificity of the one class DD-SIMCA model is 100% and 98%, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study was aimed at the nutritional characterization of indigenous lotus seed flour (LSF) and evaluating the impact of its supplementation on textural and sensory attributes of cookies. LSF dried to moisture contents~9% were evaluated for nutritional composition and supplemented in straight grade flour at the rate of 2.5-10% for the development of cookies. The results indicated that LSF significantly (p<0.05) enhanced the total phenols (92-217 mg GAE/100 g), inorganic residues (0.54-0.86 mg/100 g), and dietary fibers (0.34-0.73 g/100 g) of cookies. Irrespective of the baking losses, LSF supplemented cookies were bearing 50% 2,2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity. The supplementation of LSF resulted in a significant decrease in L* values while a* and b* values increased significantly as compared to the normal control. Sensory scoring of the baked good yielded higher acceptability for cookies supplemented with 7.5% LSF. The study concluded LSF as a potential wheat replacer in baked goods that may be tolerated well≤7.5%, and can further attribute functional and health-promoting properties to the consumer goods. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	181	188	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00622-x					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3166

International Journal of Food Properties					Identification of meat and meat products is significant for economic, religious, or public health reasons. This study focused on the detection and differentiation of meat animal species. A total of sixty-four meat samples (10 samples of each like beef, buffen, chevon, and mutton; twenty-four samples of pork) were analyzed for these purposes. PCR-RFLP of 12S rRNA gene with four restriction enzymes was performed on individual meat samples as well as mixture of different meat. Species specific primers as well as sequencing of DNA were also used to detect and verify the RFLP results. PCR amplification yielded a 456bp fragments from 100% samples. AluI digested beef DNA into 359 and 97bp, chevon and mutton DNA into 246 and 210bp fragments and pork DNA into 290 and 166bp fragments. However, it cannot digest buffen DNA. On the other hand HhaI digested only buffen DNA into 247 and 209bp fragments but not others. ApoI restricts only mutton DNA and yielded 329 and 127bp fragments but not others. Nevertheless, BspTI yielded 323 and 133bp fragments only from chevon. Besides, mixed samples (1:1) of beef-buffen and chevon-mutton can be differentiated by AluI & HhaI and BspTI & ApoI, respectively. Chord analysis based on our sequence and respective sequences of studied animals from GenBank indicated that the cutting sites are conserved in these species of animals. Phylogenetically each of the species was clustered separately. This technique may be useful for meat animal species detection and differentiation either from individual meat and mixed meat samples.

Dietary intake of coumarins and furocoumarins through citrus beverages: a detailed estimation by a HPLC-MS/MS method combined with the linear retention index system.		Foods					Official regulations concerning the maximum number of substances in food are introduced as a consequence of possible adverse effects, after oral administration. In this regard, analytical methods are necessary in order to determine specific targets. Among oxygen heterocyclic compounds (OHCs, that are furocoumarins, coumarins and polymethoxyflavones), only coumarin is subject to restriction by the Regulation (EC) No 1334/2008 of the European Parliament. Furocoumarins are known for their phototoxicity and other side effects due to their dietary intake; however, an official limit about the maximum content of these compounds in food is still missing. The lack of information about the real amount of these compounds in food is responsible for the conflicting opinions about the introduction of an official limit. The HPLC-MS/MS method here proposed, in combination with the linear retention index system, represents an innovative analytical strategy for the characterization of OHCs in citrus beverages. Several types of drinks were analysed in order to quantify 35 OHCs in total. This method is suitable for the quality control of OHCs in food and the obtained results may be considered as informative data useful for the regulatory authorities in the emission of new opinions and for a potential new regulation in this field. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In the present study pomace obtained from orange juice extraction was dried at 70 °C. The pomace powder was utilized for enrichment of yoghurt at three different concentrations viz. 1%, 2%, and 3%. The physicochemical and sensory properties of the yoghurt samples were evaluated during refrigerated storage and compared with control sample. The acidity increased with increase in concentration of the pomace powder and also with duration of storage. Syneresis of the enriched samples were found to be lower than that of control, but increased with level of enrichment. During storage syneresis decreased and then increased with duration of storage. Firmness was found to decrease with level of enrichment as well as duration of storage. The consistency index increased with level of enrichment, but during storage it initially increased and then decreased. Sensory studies showed that yoghurt enriched with 1% pomace powder was acceptable to the panelists. Practical applications. Milk and milk products are rich in many essential nutrients, but are devoid of certain other important nutrients like fiber and vitamin C. Enrichment of milk products with ingredients containing these nutrients will help in overcoming these deficiencies and make the milk products a wholesome food. Yoghurt is one such milk product which is considered to contain probiotic microorganisms can be consumed by lactose intolerant people as well. Enrichment of yoghurt with orange pomace powder will help in improving the nutritional value of yoghurt and will also open ways for utilization of orange pomace which is a waste material from orange juice production. As there are limited studies on utilization of orange pomace in dairy products, this study becomes important. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15193					FSTA:2021-06-Pl3153

Effect of adding resistant maltodextrin to pasteurized orange juice on bioactive compounds and their bioaccessibility.		Foods					Resistant maltodextrin (RMD) is a water-soluble and fermentable functional fiber. RMD is a satiating prebiotic, reducer of glucose and triglycerides in the blood, and promoter of good gut health, and its addition to food is increasingly frequent. Therefore, it is necessary to study its potential effects on intrinsic bioactive compounds of food and their bioaccessibility. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of adding RMD on the bioactive compounds of pasteurized orange juice with and without pulp, and the bioaccessibility of such compounds. RMD was added at different concentrations: 0 (control sample), 2.5%, 5%, and 7.5%. Ascorbic acid (AA) and vitamin C were analyzed using HPLC, whereas total phenols, total carotenoids (TC), and antioxidant capacity were measured using spectrophotometry. After that, sample in vitro digestibility was assessed using the standardized static in vitro digestion method. The control orange juice with pulp presented significantly higher values of bioactive compounds and antioxidant capacity than the control orange juice without pulp (p< 0.05). RMD addition before the juice pasteurization process significantly protected all bioactive compounds, namely total phenols, TC, AA, and vitamin C, as well as the antioxidant capacity (AC) (p< 0.05). Moreover, this bioactive compound protective effect was higher when higher RMD concentrations were added. However, RMD addition improved phenols and vitamin C bioaccessibility but decreased TC and AA bioaccessibility. Therefore, the AC value of samples after gastrointestinal digestion was slightly decreased by RMD addition. Moreover, orange pulp presence decreased total phenols and TC bioaccessibility but increased AA and vitamin C bioaccessibility. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Food Chemistry					Nutritional and biochemical composition of dragon fruit (Hylocereus) species H. undatus (fruits with white pulp and pink skin), and H. polyrhizus (fruits with red pulp and pink skin) were investigated to develop the nutritional composition data for dragon fruit and compare the difference between H. undatus and H. polyrhizus. The pH, TSS, total sugar, moisture, ash, protein, and dietary fibre content varied between 4.8 and 5.4, 8-12%, 5.13-7.06%, 82-85%, 0.7-0.85%, 0.90-1.1% and 0.8-1.0%, respectively. Total phenolics and flavonoids content varied between 25 and 55 mg GAE and 15-35 mg CE per 100 g, respectively. H. polyrhizus have a significantly high quantum of phenolics and antioxidant potential than H. undatus. 100 g fruit contained about 120-200 mg K, 30-45 mg Mg, 20-45 mg Ca, 20-35 mg P, 0.70-1.5 mg Fe, and 0.20-0.40 mg Zn. Vitamin C was found maximum (6 mg/100 g), followed by vitamin E (150 g), pantothenic acid (50 g), and vitamin K1 (25 g). It is an ideal fruit for maintaining good health as it has low calories.

J		Arivalagan Manivannan; Santhosh Narasegowda; Tejaswini Prakash							Comparative study on color coordinates, phenolics, flavonoids, carotenoids, and antioxidant potential of marigold (Tagetes sp.) with diverse colored petals.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Marigold (Tagetes sp.) is rich in health-promoting secondary metabolites like polyphenolic compounds and carotenoids. Though the marigold petals are excellent repository of natural pigments like carotenoids and natural antioxidants, enormous amount of dry biomass of marigold petals generated after usage is getting wasted. Thus, to utilize the marigold biomass generated effectively, there is a need of systematic study on level of natural antioxidants and pigments in diverse colored marigold petals. To address this issue, a study was conducted with the objective to determine the color coordinates, total phenolics (TPC), flavonoids (TFC), carotenoids, and in vitro antioxidant potential (AOP) in marigold flowers with varying petal colors ranging from off-white to deep orange. Significant differences were observed among the different marigold genotypes for their color coordinates, TPC, TFC, total carotenoids, and AOP. The TPC, TFC, and total carotenoid content ranged between 7.35-12.02 g GAE, 3.00-5.20 g CE, and 0.019-2.53 g betaCE/100 g dry petal, respectively. Petal color is the prime-determinant of the carotenoids, petals with light to deep orange color had significantly high amount of carotenoids than the petals with off-white to yellow color. Color coordinate a* and Chroma were positively correlated with carotenoid content, and TPC was positively correlated with AOP measured in terms of both radical scavenging activity and reducing power, while TFC was positively correlated with AOP measured in terms of radical scavenging activity. To summarize, marigold flower petals can be commercially exploited as a source of natural phenolics with antioxidant potential for utilization in food industries in place of artificial antioxidant compounds. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4343	4353	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01015-4					FSTA:2022-01-Jq0741

Food Science and Technology Research					The glass transition temperature (Tg) is an important physical property affecting the release of 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) from its inclusion complex with alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD). The release of 1-MCP from alpha-CD was investigated using humidity ramping at constant temperature and temperature ramping at constant humidity. The apparent Tg values of alpha-CD were estimated from the collapse temperatures observed in the release experiments and compared with the temperatures calculated using the Gordon-Taylor equation. Good agreement between the estimated and calculated Tg values indicated that the ramping method for flavor release from a powder matrix would be a simple and effective approach to estimate the Tg of the matrix.										2021	27	6	881	886	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.27.881					FSTA:2022-06-Ae9866

Discriminant canonical analysis as a validation tool for multivariety native breed egg commercial quality classification.		Foods					This study aimed to develop a tool to validate multivariety breed egg quality classification depending on quality-related internal and external traits using a discriminant canonical analysis approach. A flock of 60 Utrerana hens (Franciscan, White, Black, and Partridge) and a control group of 10 Leghorn hens were placed in individual cages to follow the traceability of the eggs and perform an individual internal and external quality assessment. Egg groups were determined depending on their commercial size (S, M, L, and XL), laying hen breed, and variety. Egg weight, major diameter, minor diameter, shell b*, albumen height, and the presence or absence of visual defects in yolk and/or albumen showed multicollinearity problems (variance inflation factor (VIF) > 5) and were discarded. Albumen weight, eggshell weight, and yolk weight were the most responsible traits for the differences among egg quality categories (Wilks' lambda: 0.335, 0.539, and 0.566 for albumen weight, eggshell weight, and yolk weight, respectively). The combination of traits in the first two dimensions explained 55.02% and 20.62% variability among groups, respectively. Shared properties between Partridge and Franciscan varieties may stem from their eggs presenting heavier yolks and slightly lower weights, while White Utrerana and Leghorn hens' similarities may be ascribed to hybridization reminiscences. © 2021 by the authors.

Calcium contents were higher in Utrerana eggshell (358.53 g/kg vs. 337.01 g/kg) and white (593.75 mg/kg vs. 584.31 mg/kg), while protein contents were higher in Utrerana yolk (17.40% vs. 16.90%) and white (10.60% vs 10.30%). Utrerana yolks reported higher alpha-tocopherol (102.00 mg vs. 88.00 mg), total polyunsaturated fatty acids (19.80% vs. 16.60%), and some monounsaturated fatty acids content (C18:1 n9: 42.68% vs. 41.31%; C16:1 n9: 0.60% vs. 0.50%). Black variety and Leghorns reported higher linoleic acid contents (13.72% and 13.27%, respectively) than the rest of the Utrerana varieties. Conclusively, detailed knowledge on differentiated properties of eggs depending on the animals originating them enables a correctly approaching market needs to improve the profitability and find a competitive niche for local products.

J		Ariza, J.; Garcia-Lopez, D.; Sanchez-Nieto, E.; Guillamon, E.; Banos, A.; Martinez-Bueno, M.							Antilisterial effect of a natural formulation based on citrus extract in ready-to-eat foods.		Foods					Controlling Listeria in food is a major challenge, especially because it can persist for years in food processing plants. The best option to control this pathogen is the implementation of effective cleaning and disinfection procedures that guarantee the safety and quality of the final products. In addition, consumer trends are changing, being more aware of the importance of food safety and demanding natural foods, minimally processed and free of chemical additives. For this reason, the current consumption model is focusing on the development of preservatives of natural origin, from plants or microorganisms. In sum, this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of a citrus extract formulation rich in flavonoids against several L. monocytogenes and L. innocua strains, using in vitro test (agar diffusion test, minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), and time-kill curves) and challenge test in food trials (carne mechada, salami, fresh salmon, lettuce, brine, and mozzarella cheese). The results presented in this work show that citrus extract, at doses of 5 and 10%, had a relevant antimicrobial activity in vitro against the target strains tested. Besides this, citrus extract applied on the surface of food had a significant antilisterial activity, mainly in carne mechada and mozzarella cheese, with reductions of up to eight logarithmic units with respect to the control. These results suggest that citrus extract can be considered a promising tool to improve the hygienic quality of ready-to-eat foods. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Armada, R. de la P.; Bronze, M. R.; Matias, A.; Mateos-Aparicio, I.							Triterpene-rich supercritical CO2 extracts from apple by-product protect human keratinocytes against ROS.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Supercritical fluid extraction, employing CO2 as solvent, was explored to recover high-value lipophilic compounds from apple by-product, the main solid residue generated after apple fruit processing. The experimental conditions were fixed at pressures of 300, 425, and 550 MPa and temperatures of 37, 46, and 55 °C. The total yield from the extractions was calculated and the antioxidant capacity of the different extracts was measured by ORAC and HORAC analytical methods. Furthermore, HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and GLC analyses were performed, respectively, for triterpenic compounds and fatty acid identification. The extracts were tested over human keratinocyte cell (HaCaT) to evaluate their in vitro impact. Supercritical fluid extracts obtained at 46 °C exhibited the greater operational yield and the highest concentration of triterpenic acids, namely, betulinic acid, oleanolic acid, ursolic acid, uvaol/erythrodiol, and lupeol. These results support that apple by-product is a natural source of bioactive compounds with potential cosmeceutical applications. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	5	909	919	1935-5130				10.1007/s11947-021-02615-0					FSTA:2021-08-Je9996
J		Armaforte, E.; Hopper, L.; Stevenson, G.							Preliminary investigation on the effect of proteins of different leguminous species (Cicer arietinum, Vicia faba and Lens culinarius) on the texture and sensory properties of egg-free mayonnaise.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The texture and sensory properties of egg-free mayonnaise made using protein isolate and concentrate of different leguminous species (Cicer arietinum, Vicia faba and Lens culinaris) as alternative emulsifiers were investigated and compared with a control containing pasteurised liquid whole egg. The texture of the samples was determined using a forward extrusion rig and a 25 mm cylinder probe. The samples containing chickpea protein showed no significant differences with control for all texture parameters determined (extrudability, firmness, consistency and adhesive force). Acceptance test with 60 untrained panellists was carried out using 9-points hedonic scale for the determination of several attributes and no statistically significant difference (p > 0.05) were found between control vs all treatments for all attributes. While significant differences were observed for all the instrumental colourimetric parameters (L*, a*, b* and yellowness index), results from sensory analysis shows that the appearance of all treatment was not affected by the use of alternative emulsifiers and was comparable to the appearance of the control. The results of this research show that it is possible to create egg-free mayonnaise with texture and sensory attributes comparable to the mayonnaise containing egg yolk as the main emulsifier.

Food Chemistry					The present study aimed to use fish by-products to generate gelatin peptides with potential applications in carbonated beverages. After ultrafiltration, the F < 3 kDa (fraction < 3 kDa) showed the highest peptide concentration (227.22 mg/g) as well as antibacterial (MIC of ≤ 0.5 mg/mL) and antioxidant activities, including hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging, ferrous chelation, and ferric reduction (with IC50 values of 0.88, 1.04, 0.50 mg/mL, and 0.58, respectively). 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl scavenging was the highest in the 3 < F < 10 kDa (IC50 of 0.64 mg/mL). In vitro gastrointestinal digestion significantly decreased all biological activities. Solubility, water holding capacity, and emulsifying activity of the F < 3 kDa were the highest while foaming properties and overfoaming were reversibly related to the molecular weight. All abovementioned properties, in addition to in vitro cytotoxicity analysis in different cell lines and better flavor characteristics, indicated that the F < 3 kDa could be safely and properly used as an ingredient for the fortification of carbonated beverages.

Validation of a real-time PCR method on pta gene for Clostridium tyrobutyricum quantification in milk.		Food Control					In the dairy industry, the late blowing defect in medium and long ripened cheeses causes important economic losses. This cheese defect, caused mainly by the anaerobic spore former Clostridium tyrobutyricum, is characterized by gas production resulting in holes formation in the paste, and in unpleasant aromas related to the butyrate production. Since longtime, the reference method used to detect the presence of total spore number in milk is the Most Probable Number (MPN), a semi-quantitative method which measures the bacterial growth and the gas production after heat treatment of the samples. This method often gives uncertain results, it requires long incubation periods and fails to differentiate between different species of spore-forming bacteria. A TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR targeting the phosphotransacetylase gene (pta) for C. tyrobutyricum was previously developed as an alternative technique to the traditional method, faster and more specific, and therefore of great interest to preventively determine the contamination of milk by C. tyrobutyricum. The aim of this work was the validation of this quantitative real-time PCR protocol for the C. tyrobutyricum detection in milk. Following the method validation, 120 samples of UHT and raw milk artificially contaminated with C. tyrobutyricum spores were analyzed in increasing concentrations, relating the results of the molecular method with those obtained by the MPN. Finally, 144 raw milk samples with a possible natural contamination were analyzed and demonstrated a positivity rate of 15.28% (CI95% 10.31-22.05%). All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Arnak, B. G.; Tarakci, Z.							Use of chia (Salvia hispanica L.) mucilage powder as a replacer of salep in ice cream production.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, chia (Salvia hispanica L.) mucilage powder utilization instead of salep in ice cream production was investigated. For this purpose, five groups of ice cream with different concentrations of chia mucilage powder (0%, 0.2%, 0.4%, 0.6%, and 0.8%) and salep (0.8%, 0.6%, 0.4%, 0.2%, and 0%) combination were produced and stored at -20 °C for 60 days. The addition of chia mucilage powder had no considerable effect on the pH and acidity but it decreased the first dripping time and increased the melting rate of ice cream while it significantly affected the viscosity and the overrun of the ice cream mix. Also, the hardness and stickiness values were reduced with increasing concentrations of chia mucilage powder. Considering sensory properties and all other data, the addition of chia mucilage powder up to 0.4% could be recommended to maintain the quality, reduce the cost, and finally protect the endemic orchid species. Novelty impact statement. Salep is known as the powder of dried tubers of the orchid plant and it is one of the most common stabilizers used in ice cream production. However, it is costly and its collection is limited by laws due to its endemic situation. Therefore, chia mucilage powder could be utilized as an alternative stabilizer in ice cream production due to its not only stabilizing abilities but also functional properties. This study shows that salep could partially be replaced with chia mucilage powder while maintaining ice cream quality. As the chia mucilage powder concentration in ice cream is optimized, it could serve as an alternative stabilizer and functional ingredient at an affordable price. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			arnak, bunyamin gokhan/0000-0002-9200-867X; TARAKCI, Zekai/0000-0002-3828-3232							2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16060					FSTA:2022-04-Pn1625
J		Arnao, M. B.; Hernandez-Ruiz, J.							Melatonin as a plant biostimulant in crops and during post-harvest: a new approach is needed.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					A great amount of data covering a wide variety of plant species and experimental conditions has demonstrated the beneficial actions that melatonin exerts on many aspects of plant development, including germination, photosynthesis and water economy. Melatonin behaves especially well as a plant biostimulator against biotic and abiotic stressors, increasing stress tolerance. The present contribution sets out possible future multidisciplinary studies, in which the impact of using melatonin with respect to agriculture, food technology, human nutrition and the environment needs to be clearly established. In crops, the effective dose and best formulations for individual plant species and cultivation conditions should be studied. As regards post-harvest, the focus should be on the half-life time of melatonin in fruits and water-residue treatments. Detailed studies are lacking on the human intake of phytomelatonin in different diets. Studies on the metabolization of phytomelatonin and the combined effect with other phytonutrients such as carotenoids, chlorophylls, flavonoids, fibers, etc., would also be of interest. In soils, the possible interaction between melatonin and microbiome and non-vertebrate animals is of primordial interest. In terms of the environment, although melatonin is classified as a non-hazardous agent, its limitations as a possible animal hormone disruptor have been suggested. Specific studies on the permanence of melatonin in plant tissues, plant by-products, soil, freshwater and honeybees, amongst others, are proposed to obtain crucial information. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Arnaud, E.; Collignan, A.; Courtois, F.							Drying model for small tumbled beef pieces (biltong) at ambient and mild air temperatures.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The literature on the modeling of meat drying mainly focuses on large pieces of pork with very few studies on small pieces of beef, particularly when previously tumbled with salt and vinegar. In this study, the drying kinetics of tumbled small pieces of beef (biltong) were investigated experimentally using a pilot dryer that allowed precise control of the air conditions. The kinetics were then modeled using a two-compartment model that mimicked the diffusion model. Results. Showed that two experimental drying kinetics were enough to identify model parameters and to mimic the drying behavior of biltong of different sizes subjected to a wide range of drying conditions (25-55 °C, 30-40% relative humidity). The model also produced acceptable results (mean error on moisture content <0.1d. B. And r2>.99) for simulating biltong drying in industrial conditions. This model can be used as a sizing tool for small and medium drying plants in southern Africa. Practical Applications. Drying is widely used to process traditional meat products such as the salted/dried biltong in South Africa. The final product and the manufacturing process used to produce biltong are well described by Jones in 2017. Biltong is original because it is made of strips of meat while up to now, modeling studies have mainly dealt with large meat muscles, like dried cured ham. Biltong, on the other hand, resembles to many other salted/dried products made from small meat muscles all over the world or meat strips mainly in developing countries but not only, for example jerky in the United States. The model developed will be useful for the prediction of drying time by processors who wants to ensure their end product remain stable and have to cope with variations in the size of the meat strips and in the temperature of the drying air. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	12			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13912					FSTA:2022-03-Sg1618

Covalent linkage of bioactive volatiles to a polysaccharide support as a potential approach for preparing active edible coatings and delivery systems for food products.		Food Chemistry					In this study, a potential of covalent linkage approach for developing active edible coatings was examined. Vanillin and trans-cinnamaldehyde were bound to chitosan by Schiff base reaction and reductive amination. The modified polysaccharides were comprehensively characterized and applied as active coatings on fresh-cut melon. The covalent linkage allowed overcoming solubility problems with the lipophilic vanillin and cinnamaldehyde and neutralizing their volatility, producing well-adhered coatings that enhanced fruit quality and storability without sensorial impairment. The attached hydrophobic moieties also provided new polysaccharides with self-assembling ability. Their aggregates were loaded with antimicrobial citral and added to mandarin juice, resulting in up to 6 log CFU/mL microbial count reduction. Thus, the covalent linkage concept offers several advantages, especially when hydrophobic or volatile active agents are used. Further developed, it may become a safe and effective tool for the formation of advanced active edible coatings and delivery vehicles for direct applications on food products.

Food Bioscience					Production of sweet potato protein (SPP) gels with enhanced viscoelasticity and mechanical properties through transglutaminase (Tgase) catalyzed SPP epsilon-(gamma-glutamy)-lysine cross-link was investigated. Tgase induced cross-link of SPP increased the protein molecular weight, and slightly reduced its gelling point. Gel viscoelasticity was significantly enhanced with the maximum storage modulus (G′max) increasing from 2,990 Pa to 30,700 Pa as Tgase concentration increased from 0% to 5.0%. The exponent (z′) of the power law (G′ =k′ omegaz′) , decreased from 0.024 (control SPP gel) to z′in the range 0.018-0.022 for the SPP epsilon-(gamma-glutamy)-lysine cross-link (SPP-GL) gels. SPP gel network structure showed increased covalence interaction with increase in the level of Tgase induced cross-linking. SPP gel had no fracture stress but suffer deformation under little stress, while SPP-GL cross-linked gels formed with 1.6,3.2 and 5.0% Tgase could withstand higher stress and had fracture stress and strain in the range 97.3-235.5 kNm-2 and 0.065-0.448 respectively. Tgase induced SPP epsilon-(gamma-glutamy)-lysine cross-link enhanced SPP gel hardness, resilience and adhesiveness. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Covalently linked sweet potato protein (SPP)-dextran conjugates were produced through Maillard reaction, and the effects of this conjugation on physicochemical and gelling properties of SPP were studied. Formation of SPP-dextran-conjugated product was confirmed with increase in browning intensity and molecular weight, with concomitant reduction in free amino group content of the protein. Dry-heating period of 0, 1, 3, 5 and 7 days gave rise to 0%, 12.8%, 19.0%, 25.2% and 22.8% degree of conjugation (DC), respectively. High molecular weight protein polymer with polydispersed band above 50 kDa was formed. FTIR spectroscopic analysis showed that the C-O (amide I) and C-N (amide II) stretching bands were modified by the Maillard reaction. Conjugation of SPP with dextran reduced its denaturation temperature. SPP-dextran conjugate gels" network structures were sustained by both physical interactions and covalent bonds. SPP-dextran conjugates" gels had significantly improved hardness and resilience in comparison with the unmodified SPP (P< 0.05). © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Food Bioscience					In this study, the antioxidant capacity of the Lactobacillus plantarum Y16 fermented soybean milk was investigated by different chemical antioxidant methods and ABAP-induced oxidative stress model in HepG2 cells. It was found that the L. plantarum Y16 fermented soybean milk had better radical scavenging ability for hydroxyl and DPPH radicals, and had better ferric ion reduction ability compared with unfermented soybean milk. The cellular antioxidant assay (CAA) analysis revealed that the CAA values of ethanol and water extracts of L. plantarum Y16 fermented soymilk were dose dependent. The further research showed that the ethanol and water extracts of L. plantarum Y16 fermented soybean milk protected the HepG2 cells against ABAP oxidative damage through activating Nrf2/Keap1 signaling pathway and up-regulating the expression of heme oxygenase-1(HO-1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX).

J		Arp, C. G.; Correa, M. J.; Ferrero, C.							Improving quality: modified celluloses applied to bread dough with high level of resistant starch.		Food Hydrocolloids					Additives have been used in the baking industry for a long time with many purposes, and their use is frequently focused on correcting the quality deficiency of wheat flour. Nevertheless, with the flourishing search for novel functional baked goods, additives have seen expanded their action field since they can exert a quality rectification effect also when novel ingredients are assessed to obtain new functional foods. In this work, two modified celluloses (MC), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose and carboxymethylcellulose, were evaluated as additives for the recovering of rheological and microstructural quality of bread dough enriched with 30% type 2 resistant maize starch (flour basis). The results showed that both MC effectively improved the technological quality of the dough by enhancing the farinographic performance and reducing the high storage modulus of the resistant starch dough without additives. Moreover, only slight modifications were found over the loss modulus and the pasting properties. The observation of the gluten network by CLSM showed that the addition of the MC leads to a more cross-linked and complex gluten network which would explain the longer stability values of the MC-added dough samples found in the farinographic tests. This positive effect would be explained by hydrocolloid-gluten protein interactions as well as by the higher amount of water needed for the preparation of the dough. Finally, the work showed that the use of MC would be a suitable option to get rheology-balanced bread dough that leads to a highly fiber-enriched and good-quality bread.

J		Arpan Dubey; Amit Kumar; Srinivasa Rao, P.							Development and storage study of reduced calorie aloe vera (Aloe barbadensis Miller) based pineapple fruit jam.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Fruit jam is a bioactive rich shelf stable food product containing a large amount of sugar. Higher sugar consumption leads to health risks such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and hypertension, which presents an urge for jam modification. Therefore, the present work was aimed to develop and characterize a reduced calorie Aloe vera based pineapple (AVP) jam followed by process optimization and storage study. The study showed that the increase of pineapple and sugar concentration during jam making resulted in a decrease in pH but an increase in viscosity and hardness of the AVP jam. The optimized jam (44% pineapple, 25% sugar and 16 min processing time) was obtained by targeting maximum bioactives and desirable textural characteristics using response surface methodology. Optimized reduced calorie jam presented hairy micro-structure, noticeable different from continuous smooth micro-surface of high sugar jam. The storage of jam at temperature of 5,25, and 35 °C demonstrated a continuous decline in pH, bioactive compounds and prominent color change due to darkening of jam with increase in storage time. Chroma values followed first-order kinetics at higher temperature but linear kinetics at lower temperature. Further, bioactive degradation presented a linear trend at lower temperature but deviated from linearity at higher temperature. The developed reduced calorie AVP jam retained high bioactive properties and was microbiologically safe for at least five weeks of storage without any preservative. Storage of jam at elevated temperature had negative effects on physiochemical properties indicating better stability of jam at lower temperature. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	1	961	975	2193-4126				10.1007/s11694-020-00689-6					FSTA:2021-06-Jg7255

Optimization of spray drying parameters for custard apple (Annona squamosa L.) pulp powder development using response surface methodology (RSM) with improved physicochemical attributes and phytonutrients.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Custard apple (Annona squamosa L.) is a highly perishable fruit, possessing enormous phytochemicals and nutrients with potential antioxidant, antimicrobial and anti-cancerous properties. In the present investigation, spray drying parameters were optimized to produce custard apple pulp powder (CAPP) using response surface methodology (RSM). The drying was carried out in a laboratory spray dryer at different levels of inlet air temperature (100-140 °C), outlet air temperature (70-110 °C), and maltodextrin (MD) concentration (10-20 g/dL). The optimized condition comprised an inlet temperature of 135 °C, outlet temperature of 75 °C, and the maltodextrin content of 15 g/dL, respectively. Under this optimized condition, the maximum powder yield of 14.8 g/dL with moisture content of 5 g/100 g was obtained. The bulk density, yield, degree of caking, solubility index, and dispersibility were significant (p < 0.05) in optimized CAPP. Further, scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed the amorphous behavior of spray-dried CAPP, showing minimum hygroscopicity. The differential scanning calorimetry and thermal gravimetric analysis of CAPP revealed better stability with a glass transition temperature of 200 °C, making it suitable at commercial and domestic level. The HPLC analysis of CAPP revealed the presence of phytonutrients like lutein and zeaxanthin having antioxidant and anti-diabetic properties.

Chemical and bioactive characterization of Spanish and Belgian apple pomace for its potential use as a novel dermocosmetic formulation.		Foods					Currently, there is a general trend towards reutilizing industrial by-products that would otherwise be discarded or considered as waste, aiming to explore them as alternative sources of valuable compounds. The apple pomace remaining from cider and apple juice industries represents a high-potential source of bioactive compounds with putative application in food or pharmaceutical-related products. Accordingly, the work reported herein was conducted to characterize the phenolic compounds in apple pomace from Belgium and Spain, as well as to evaluate its chemical composition and particular types of bioactivity. As a proof of concept, a new hydrogel was prepared, incorporated with the bioactive compounds and pectin extracted from apple pomace, aiming to obtain the most organic formulation possible. Independently of the extracting agent, it became evident that using lyophilization as the drying step is a better choice than thermal processes as it yielded a richer phenolic profile (fifteen individual compounds), with 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid as the major compound (66 to 114 mg/100 g dw) in Belgian samples. In general, the hydroethanolic extracts showed the strongest antioxidant and antimicrobial (particularly against Propionibacterium acnes: MIC = 2.5 mg/mL) activities. This result, together with the lipid nature of human skin, led it to be chosen as the extract type to be incorporated in the hydrogel.

Impact of 2100-projected air temperature, carbon dioxide, and water scarcity on grape primary and secondary metabolites of different Vitis vinifera cv. Tempranillo clones.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					The exploration of the grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) intra-varietal diversity can be an interesting approach for the adaptation of viticulture to climate change. We evaluated the response of four Tempranillo clones to simulated year-2100-expected air temperature, CO2, and relative humidity (RH) conditions: climate change (CC; 28°C/18°C, 700mumol mol-1 CO2, and 35%/53% RH) vs current situation conditions (CS; 24°C/14°C, 400mumol mol-1 CO2, and 45%/63% RH), under two irrigation regimes, "well-watered" (WW) vs "water deficit" (WD). The treatments were applied to fruit-bearing cuttings grown under research-oriented greenhouse controlled conditions. CC increased sugar accumulation and hastened grape phenology, an effect that was mitigated by water deficit. Both CC and water deficit modified amino acid concentrations and accumulation profiles with different intensities, depending on the clone. Combined CC and water deficit decreased anthocyanins and the anthocyanin to total soluble solids (TSS) ratio. The results suggest differences in the response of the clones to the 2100-projected conditions, which are not always solely explained by differences observed in the ripening dynamics. Among the clones studied, RJ43 and CL306 were the most affected by CC/WD conditions; meanwhile, 1084 was globally less affected than the other clones.

Determination of capsaicinoids and carotenoids for the characterization and geographical origin authentication of paprika by UHPLC-APCI-HRMS.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The production area mislabeling of a food product is considered a fraudulent practice worldwide. In this work, a method that uses ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (UHPLC-APCI-HRMS) was used for the geographical origin authentication of paprika based on the determination of capsaicinoids and carotenoids. Satisfactory instrumental method performance was obtained, providing good linearity (R2> 0.998), run-to-run and day-to-day precisions (%RSD < 15 and 10%, respectively), and trueness (relative errors < 10%), while method limits of quantification were between 0.21 and 51 mg kg-1. Capsaicinoids and carotenoids were determined in 136 paprika samples, from different origins (La Vera, Murcia, Hungary, and the Czech Republic) and types (hot, sweet, and bittersweet). The composition of capsaicinoids and carotenoids was used as chemical descriptors to achieve paprika authentication through a classification decision tree built by partial least squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) models and reaching a rate of 80.9%.

J		Arroyo, C.; Arboleda, A. M.							Sonic food words influence the experience of beverage healthfulness.		Food Quality and Preference					The consumption of healthful foods is relevant for the well-being of society. However, understanding healthfulness may be difficult because, in some cultures (i.e., the U.S.), individuals assume that unhealthy equals tasty, an association that does not hold in other contexts (i.e., France). Auditory cues could serve to inform consumers about the expected experience with food and thus could signal the sensory experience of a healthy product. This research contributes to the literature on the use of sound symbolism for analysis of the influence of onomatopoeias as packaging information that influences the expected healthfulness of a bottled drink. The study is a 4*4 mixed-model experiment. Grouping was done according to onomatopoeia variables as follows: "Fizz," "Glup," "Ahhh," and control. Beverage color, a within-subject variable, was grouped as green, yellow, red, and control. Results. Show that the healthful concept is defined in two dimensions: fulfilling and light. Onomatopoeias motivated the experience of a less fulfilling beverage, which had the strongest effect on "Fizz" condition. For the light dimension, "Ahhh" diminishes the perception of light, thus creating the idea that the drink is high in calories. This study reaches out to food industries on the need to find the most consistent and pleasurable sound associated with their products. This will enable food industries to provide information to consumers as well as ascertain how much they enjoy the product. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Delving into the bacterial diversity of spoiled green Manzanilla Spanish-style table olive fermentations.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					This work applies metataxonomic, standard statistics, and compositional data (CoDa) techniques to study the bacterial diversity of spoiled and normal Spanish-style table olive fermentations, analysing a total of 10-tons of industrial fermentation containers from two processing yards. Forty percent were affected by butyric, sulfidic, or putrid spoilage, while 60% followed the ordinary fermentation course. The samples were obtained at 30 days of fermentation, determining their 16S rRNA gene Amplicon Sequence Variant compositions (ASVs). The butyric containers showed a bacterial profile strongly associated with the genera Enterococcus, Leuconostoc, and Atlantibacter, but also with Lactiplantibacillus and Melissococcus, and less confident to Raoultella, Enterobacter, Serratia, and Celerinatantimonas. The sulfidic fermentation was linked to Alkalibacterium and, to a lesser extent, Marinilactibacillus and the absence of Lactiplantibacillus. Putrid spoilage was mainly related to Halolactibacillus and Alkalibacterium. Sulfidic/putrid (together) differed from butyric spoilage by the presence of Alkalibacterium/Marinilactibacillus as well as by Halomonas/Halanaerobium. Lactiplantibacillus dominated normal fermentations, but Vibrio was also frequently found (0-46%), apparently not causing any alteration. These results contribute to a better microbial characterisation of non-zapatera spoiled table olive fermentations. They also suggest using several statistical techniques to discriminate normal vs spoiled fermentations adequately. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Arroyo-Manzanares, N.; Rodriguez-Estevez, V.; Garcia-Campana, A. M.; Castellon-Rendon, E.; Gamiz-Gracia, L.							Determination of principal ergot alkaloids in swine feeding.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Ergot alkaloids are secondary metabolites produced by fungi in the genus Claviceps. They contaminate a large variety of cereals, such as rye, triticale, wheat and barley. The ingestion of contaminated cereals might cause adverse health effects in humans and animals. In fact, pigs, cattle, sheep, and poultry are involved in sporadic outbreaks and, although there are several studies about occurrence of ergot alkaloids in grain cereals, there are scarce studies focused on compound feed. Results. Twelve ergot alkaloids have been quantified in 228 feed samples intended for swine. The analytes were extracted using QuEChERS with Z-Sep+as sorbent in the clean-up step, which reduced the matrix effect, allowing limits of quantification between 2.1 and 21.7 mug kg-1. The analytes were subsequently quantified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). A total of 29 samples (12.7%) revealed contamination by at least one ergot alkaloid, and among contaminated samples, 65% were contaminated by more than one. Only 6 of 12 target ergot alkaloids showed concentrations above the limit of quantification. The concentrations for individual ergot alkaloids ranged between 5.9 mug kg-1 for ergosinine to 145.3 mug kg-1 for ergometrine (the predominant ergot alkaloid), while the total ergot alkaloid content ranged from 5.9 to 158.7 mug kg-1. Conclusions. The occurrence of ergot alkaloids in feed samples in Spain seems to be lower than in other regions of Europe. All the samples fulfilled current recommendations of the feed industry about practical limits for ergot alkaloids in pig feeds. This suggests that the feeds are safe for pig consumption, regarding the presence of ergot alkaloids. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Arru, L.; Mussi, F.; Forti, L.; Buschini, A.							Biological effect of different spinach extracts in comparison with the individual components of the phytocomplex.		Foods					The Mediterranean-style diet is rich in fruit and vegetables and has a great impact on the prevention of major chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. In this work we investigated the ability of spinach extracts obtained by different extraction methods and of the single main components of the phytocomplex, alone or mixed, to modulate proliferation, antioxidant defense, and genotoxicity of HT29 human colorectal cells. Spinach extracts show dose-dependent activity, increasing the level of intracellular endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) when tested at higher doses. In the presence of oxidative stress, the activity is related to the oxidizing agent involved (H2O2 or menadione) and by the extraction method. The single components of the phytocomplex, alone or mixed, do not alter the intracellular endogenous level of ROS but again, in the presence of an oxidative insult, the modulation of antioxidant defense depends on the oxidizing agent used. The application of the phytocomplex extracts seem to be more effective than the application of the single phytocomplex components. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

"Floc and Sink" technique removes cyanobacteria and microcystins from tropical reservoir water.		Toxins					Combining coagulants with ballast (natural soil or modified clay) to remove cyanobacteria from the water column is a promising tool to mitigate nuisance blooms. Nevertheless, the possible effects of this technique on different toxin-producing cyanobacteria species have not been thoroughly investigated. This laboratory study evaluated the potential effects of the "Floc and Sink" technique on releasing microcystins (MC) from the precipitated biomass. A combined treatment of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) with lanthanum modified bentonite (LMB) and/or local red soil (LRS) was applied to the bloom material (mainly Dolichospermum circinalis and Microcystis aeruginosa) of a tropical reservoir. Intra and extracellular MC and biomass removal were evaluated. PAC alone was not efficient to remove the biomass, while PAC + LMB + LRS was the most efficient and removed 4.3-7.5 times more biomass than other treatments. Intracellular MC concentrations ranged between 12 and 2.180 g L-1 independent from the biomass. PAC treatment increased extracellular MC concentrations from 3.5 to 6 times. However, when combined with ballast, extracellular MC was up to 4.2 times lower in the top of the test tubes. Nevertheless, PAC + LRS and PAC + LMB + LRS treatments showed extracellular MC concentration eight times higher than controls in the bottom. Our results showed that Floc and Sink appears to be more promising in removing cyanobacteria and extracellular MC from the water column than a sole coagulant (PAC). © 2021 by the authors.

A new perspective of a well-recognized raw material: phenolic content, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities and alpha- and beta-acids profile of Brazilian hop (Humulus lupulus L.) extracts.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Hop is a plant with several biological properties. Many factors affect both the presence and concentration of hop compounds, such as cultivar, location and growth conditions. Recently, the interest of hop cultivation in Brazil has grown despite the tropical weather and it has been possible to obtain hop completely cultivated in Brazilian soil. This study analyzed the chemical composition and verified the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of Brazilian hop hydroethanolic extracts in comparison to a commercially available hop cultivar. Brazilian hops were a good source of flavonoids (5.72-12.82 mg CE/g dw), and presented a high content of phenolic compounds, in particular the Canastra cultivar (35.1 mg GAE/g dw). The Brazilian cultivars showed interesting antioxidant and antimicrobial proprieties. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to hop hydroethanolic extracts and Staphylococcus aureus was inhibited by the extracts of all cultivars. The extracts presented antifungal activity against Byssochlamys nivea and significant growth inhibition at the higher concentration tested (20 mul/ml). The hydroethanolic extracts exhibited a high content of alpha- and beta-acids, mainly the Vitoria, Columbus and Canastra cultivars, reaching almost 60% (w/w). These characteristics evidenced the potential application of Brazilian hops as raw materials in both pharmaceutical and food industries.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The present studies were conducted to investigate the effects of different concentration of neem leaf extract (NLE) (control, 10%, 20% and 30%) on physiological, biochemical, antioxidant properties, and fruit quality attributes of Shamber grapefruit during cold storage at 10 °C up to 43 days. Weight loss, peel weight, juice weight, rag weight, ascorbic acid, total sugars (TS), reducing sugars (RS), non-reducing sugars (NRS), total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), TSS/TA ratio and enzyme activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were determined. NLE treatments showed significant effect on postharvest quality attributes of Shamber grapefruit. NLE-treated grapefruit (30%) reduced the weight loss (16%), and retained maximum peel weight (9.02%), juice weight (25.56%) and rag weight (19.21%) than untreated control fruit. Moreover, high level of ascorbic acid, TSS, TA, and lower level of TS, RS and NRS were observed in NLE (30%) treated fruits. Enzymatic activities of SOD, POD and CAT of stored grapefruit were highly significant in NLE (30%) treated grapefruit during storage period compared to control. In conclusion, pre-storage NLE (30%) application was the most effective in maintaining various physiochemical properties such as weight loss, ascorbic acid, TS, RS, NRS, TSS, TA, TSS: TA ratio and increasing the antioxidative responses (SOD, POD and CAT) up to 43 days by extending the shelf life of Shamber grapefruit. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Chemistry					In this study, bacterial cellulose nanocrystals (BCNCs) were obtained from bacterial cellulose nanofibers (BCNFs) by controlled hydrolysis of sulfuric and hydrochloric acids. The influence of hydrolysis temperature and acid type with the addition of the post-treatment step was studied. The obtained BCNCs were analyzed based on the structural characterization and the properties of the nanocrystals. The BCNCs crystallinity increased, and the size of nanocrystals decreased with increasing 10 °C hydrolysis temperature for both acid hydrolysis conditions. Hydrolysis conditions with neutralization post-treatment did not alter the thermal stability of nanocrystals, and BCNCs had high thermal stability like raw BCNFs. Elemental analysis results indicated that sulfur content (S%) was very low for sulfuric acid hydrolyzed samples, and X-ray results did not show any sulfate salt peaks. Thermal stable BCNCs with high crystallinity were successfully produced to meet the process requirements in various applications, especially in the food industry. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The effect of health prompts on product consideration, attention to information, and choice in large, online product assortments: the case of fiber.		Food Quality and Preference					Health-focused point-of-decision prompts (PDPs) influence consumers to purchase healthier food products, but how PDPs work has not been established. We examined how a PDP focused on fiber consumption, an under-consumed nutrient, influences consumers to select healthier products. US-based participants (n=753), randomly assigned to a PDP or control condition, completed a simulated online shopping experience that included features of real-world retail settings, such as the ability to examine subsets of products and to choose to access nutrition information. In each condition, participants made choices in cereal, bread, and cracker categories. Participants could choose to view all or subsets of products before making a selection and reported the nutrient information they examined. We used mediation analysis to examine direct and indirect pathways through which the PDP affected the fiber content and healthiness rating of choices. Indirect pathways were whether the set of products the participant considered included healthy options (HCS) and attention to fiber information (AFI) when making choices. The PDP increased fiber content and Guiding Stars (GS) ratings of product choices by a total of 0.53 g dietary fiber/serving and 0.25 GS, respectively. This increase resulted from direct and indirect influences from the PDP. The direct effect increased fiber (GS) by 0.19 g dietary fiber/serving (0.072 GS). The indirect influence of the PDP through HCS increased 0.21 g dietary fiber/serving (0.104 GS) and through AFI increased 0.13 g dietary fiber/serving (0.035 GS). The PDP engendered healthier purchases by influencing consumer behavior at multiple points in the decision-making process. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Efficient utilization of date palm waste for the bioethanol production through Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain.		Food Science & Nutrition					Dates (Phoenix dactylifera L.) are rich in nutritional compounds, particularly in sugars. Sugars offer anaerobic fermentation, used for bioethanol production. Recently, researchers and industrialists finding ways to produce low-cost bioethanol on large scale using agricultural wastes. Date palm residual is the largest agricultural waste in Pakistan, which can be the cheapest source for bioethanol production, whereas the current study was designed to explore the possible utilization and the potential of date palm waste for bioethanol production through Saccharomyces cerevisiae grown in yeast extract, Bacto peptone, and d-glucose medium. The fermentation process resulted in the production of 15% (v/v) ethanol under the optimum condition of an incubation period of 72 hr and three sugars (glucose, fructose, and sucrose) were found in date waste. The functional group of ethanol (C2H5OH) was also found via Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis. Therefore, S. cerevisiae could be recommended for ethanol production due to short fermentation time at 25% inoculum in 30 °C and reduced the processing cost. Common date varieties of low market value are a preferred substrate for the process of producing industrial ethanol. Additionally, proximate analysis of date fruit by near-infrared spectroscopy revealed moisture contents (16.84%), crude protein (0.3%), ash (9.8%), crude fat (2.6%), and neutral detergent fibers (13.4%). So, date fruit contains various nutrients for microbial growth for ethanol production. © 2021 The Authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of methanol and water extracts of peach leaves dried in air and microwave drying on E. coli ATCC 25922 and L. monocytogenes ATCC 7644 were investigated. Pathogens were inoculated into broth medium prior to the extract addition. Samples were then kept at 4 °C for 15 min. The highest inhibitory effect on the samples inoculated with E. coli at 5.440.03 cfu/ml and 7.440.03 cfu/ml levels was obtained from the treatment of microwave-water; the final enumeration counts of E. coli were 3.800.01 cfu/ml and 5.440.07 cfu/ml, respectively. Similarly, the highest inhibitory effect on the samples inoculated with L. monocytogenes at 5.180.02 cfu/ml and 7.180.02 cfu/ml levels was obtained from the treatment of microwave-methanol; the final enumeration counts of L. monocytogenes were 4.400.03 cfu/ml and 6.030.07 cfu/ml, respectively. Inhibitory activity of microwave-dried peach leaf extracts was higher. The highest TPC (4.08 mg GAE/ml) values were obtained from air-dried samples extracted by water. The DPPH value of both extracts of microwave-dried samples was higher than the air-dried samples. The results indicate methanol extracts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant agent may be used to reduce microbial population. Novelty Impact Statement. The highest Total phenolic content (4.08 mg GAE/g) values was seen samples that dried in the air extracted with water. All samples TEAC values changed from 0.86 to 5.35 mg TEAC/g. The Inhibitory effect of all peach leaf extracts on E. coli and L. monocytogenes was found statically important (p<.05). © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15847					FSTA:2022-01-Jd0792

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study investigated the usability of sheep wool peptone (SWP) as an organic nitrogen source in production of pigments from the bacterium Serratia marcescens and the yeast Rhodotorula glutinis. SWP was prepared from sheep wool by KOH hydrolysis and H3PO4 neutralization. The potantial of SWP on pigment synthesis was compared with commercial tryptone peptone (TP) and proteose peptone (PP). The effectiveness of peptones on pigment synthesis was tested at different culture pH s and peptone concentrations in shaking flask culture. An initial medium pH of 7.0 and a peptone concentration of 6 g/L were found to be optimal for carotenoid synthesis in R. glutinis, but an initial culture pH of 8.0 and a peptone concentration of 8 g/L for prodigiosin synthesis in S. marcescens. In SWP, TP and PP-based cultures; prodigiosin concentrations of 341,175, and 302 mg/L; and carotenoid concentration of 94, 88, and 80 mg/L were reached. Novelty impact statement. Commercial peptones or protein hydrolysates are extensively used as organic nitrogen source in production of microbial pigments; however, high price of peptones restricts their use for this purpose. The present study revealed that protein hydrolysate prepared from sheep wool could be used as a peptone source in production of pigments from the yeast Rhodotorula glutinisI and the bacterium Serratia marcescens. SWP was found to be superior to commercial peptones for production of both R. glutinis and S. marcescens pigments. Usability of wool protein hydrolyzate as an organic nitrogen source or peptone in production of microbial pigments was tested for the first time in the present study. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Arslan, R.; Eroglu, E. C.; Aksay, S.							Determination of bioactive properties of protein and pigments obtained from Spirulina platensis.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Microalgae have a great potential for usage in functional foods or ingredients. The amount of the pigments obtained with different solvents from Spirulina platensis and their antioxidant activities, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibition of S. platensis and dried phycocyanin powder were investigated. The highest Chlorophyll-a and phycocyanin pigment contents were 9.26 mg chlorophyll-a/g dry spirulina and 78.57 mg phycocyanin/g dry spirulina using sequentially extraction, respectively. It was found that Chlorophyll extracts have higher antioxidant activity (14.62-16.19 mg FeSO4.7H2O/g dry spirulina) than phycocyanin extracts (10.87-12.34 mg FeSO4.7H2O/g dry spirulina). Single extraction was preferred due to increased pigment concentration and antioxidant activity. The percent ACE inhibition values of 10% S. platensis powder and phycocyanin powder suspensions were found as 92.40% and 89.50%, respectively. The necessary protein concentration of S. platensis and phycocyanin powder samples to inhibit 50% of the ACE activity (IC50 values) were 2.93 and 3.96 mg protein/ml, respectively. It was concluded that S. platensis suspension could be more effective than the pure phycocyanin on ACE inhibition. Practical applications. Microalgae itself can be considered as functional food or food ingredient because of the bioactive contents such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, sterols, pigments, proteins and enzymes, vitamins, and other bioactive substances. In this study, the quantities and the antioxidant activities of phycocyanin and chlorophyll-a pigments obtained from Spirulina platensis by sequential extraction of methanol and aqueous sodium nitrate solutions were determined. Also, protein contents and ACE inhibition of residual protein rich fraction were determined after the pigment extraction. The results showed that pigment fractions and residual protein content after pigment extraction have antioxidative and antihypertensive health promoting potential. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Postharvest freezing process assessment of the blueberry structure in three acts: bioimpedance, color, and granulometry analysis.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The bioelectrical impedance, cell granulometry and the color of the freeze-thawed blueberries were investigated. The blueberries were subjected to freezing at -18 °C for 135 min, during this process, groups were removed to every 9 min, and stored at 4°C until further analysis. Bioelectrical impedance, color, pH, total soluble solids and cell granulometry were measured. The characteristics of bioelectrical impedance, cell granulometry and color were analyzed by computational algorithms, which allowed extracting characteristic of blueberries during the freezing process. The results showed progressive loss of the cellular structure during freezing, this behavior was associated with the bioimpedance parameters. The cells damage also influenced color parameters, and cell granulometry. The color followed the direction toward darkness and more intense red-blue tones, which suggest the migration of pigments from the blueberry's skin towards the flesh. In conclusion, evaluation of the color and cell granulometry by computational algorithms with bioelectrical impedance provides a powerful tool for evaluating cell damage in blueberries during the freezing process.

Screening of twelve pea (Pisum sativum L.) cultivars and their isolates focusing on the protein characterization, functionality, and sensory profiles.		Foods					Pea protein concentrates and isolates are important raw materials for the production of plant-based food products. To select suitable peas (Pisum sativum L.) for protein extraction for further use as food ingredients, twelve different cultivars were subjected to isoelectric precipitation and spray drying. Both the dehulled pea flours and protein isolates were characterized regarding their chemical composition and the isolates were analyzed for their functional properties, sensory profiles, and molecular weight distributions. Orchestra, Florida, Dolores, and RLPY cultivars showed the highest protein yields. The electrophoretic profiles were similar, indicating the presence of all main pea allergens in all isolates. The colors of the isolates were significantly different regarding lightness (L*) and red-green (a*) components. The largest particle size was shown by the isolate from Florida cultivar, whereas the lowest was from the RLPY isolate. At pH 7, protein solubility ranged from 40% to 62% and the emulsifying capacity ranged from 600 to 835 mL g-1. The principal component analysis revealed similarities among certain pea cultivars regarding their physicochemical and functional properties. The sensory profile of the individual isolates was rather similar, with an exception of the pea-like and bitter attributes, which were significantly different among the isolates. © 2021 by the authors.

Quality changes of fresh-cut watermelon during storage as affected by cut intensity and UV-C pre-treatment.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The effect of a UV-C (0, 2.4, 4.8 and 7.2 kJ m-2) pre-treatment was studied during storage at 5 °C on quality changes of fresh-cut watermelon cylinders with different cut intensities (2.7 cm o; 1, 2, 4 or 8 cm length). The steady state of the modified atmosphere was reached on day 4 with 4.5-9.6 kPa CO2+ 14 kPa O2. UV-C treatments were more effective against enterobacteria since enterobacteria counts were better preserved during storage in 4 and 8 cm cylinders under 7.2 kJ m-2. The longest shelf life (7 days), based on sensory quality, was established for the biggest cylinders (8 cm) treated with 4.8 kJ m-2, while it was reduced to 5 days for the remaining UV-C doses, regardless of the cut intensity. Lycopene content (52.1-75.3 mg kg-1) was not affected by radiation treatments. After UV-C illumination, initial total phenolic contents (387-508 mg kg-1) were reduced, reporting less reductions for higher cut intensities. Initial total antioxidant capacity (1.32-2.44 mmol kg-1), mainly due to phenolic compounds and lycopene, was decreased after UV-C treatments. Total antioxidant capacity of UV-C samples was increased (2-to 14-fold) compared with untreated samples throughout storage as an antioxidant response of UV-stressed samples. Conclusively, fresh-cut watermelon cylinders of 8 cm length (2.7 cm o) better preserved their quality during storage compared with smaller cylinders, with a shelf life of 7 days when a 4.8-kJ m-2 UV-C dose was applied. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

Novel insights on the multi-functional properties of flavonol glucosides from red onion (Allium cepa L) solid waste-in vitro and in silico approach.		Food Chemistry					Flavonol glucosides was extracted from red onion solid waste (ROSW) and multi-functional properties were determined to develop alternative strategy for therapeutic beneficiation and utilisation as functional food. The major flavonol glucosides extracted from ROSW were confirmed as quercetin-3,4′-O-diglucoside (QDG), quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercetin), quercetin-4′-O-glucoside (spiraeoside), isorhamnetin-4′-glucoside (IMG), quercetin glycoside (QG), and quercetin (Q) using a combination of chromatographic, spectroscopic and scientific literature data. The ROSW solvent fractions and extracted flavonol glucosides showed significant antioxidant effect with DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and ORAC radical scavenging assays. The in vitro and in silico study revealed that the QG, QDG, isoquercetin, and spiraeoside from ROSW exhibited potent alpha-glucosidase, tyrosinase and xanthine oxidase enzyme inhibitory activity. In addition, QG, QDG, isoquercetin, and spiraeoside showed potent anticancer effect on HeLa cancer lines. Considering these results, the utilization of ROSW and their flavonol glucosides might be helpful for developing potential antioxidant, anticancer and enzyme inhibitory agents.

Extraction and characterization of the polar lipid fraction of blackberry and passion fruit seeds oils using supercritical fluid extraction.		Food Analytical Methods					The study of the phytochemical composition of seed oils is of upmost importance for the food and cosmetic industries, mainly considering their associated biological properties. Extraction of seed oils using supercritical fluids (SFE) is an ecological and green alternative to conventional extraction processes since it is able to provide with potent bioactive extracts, avoiding degradation and transformation of the compounds present originally in the raw material. The objective of the present work was the extraction of pure fractions of polar lipids and their chemical characterization using chromatographic techniques such as GC-MS and LC-DAD-MS/MS of blackberry (Rubus glaucus) and passion fruit (Passiflora edulis) seed oils extracted by supercritical carbon dioxide. Oleamides derived from oleic acid were identified as the main compounds in both samples; in particular, 9-octadecenamide was the major identified oleamide. Besides, the extract obtained from passion fruit showed to be a source of linoleic acid, while the SFE extract from blackberry presented important concentrations of vanillin. The chemical composition of these seed oils can be of high interest for their further use in cosmetics and food industry. ©The Author(s) 2021.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The primary effluent of Indian dairy industries, cheese whey, and its main component lactose is considered an environmental pollutant due to its high chemical and biological oxygen demand. The model fermentative yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, does not possess the necessary enzyme to utilize lactose in whey. In the present study, metabolic engineering of wild type S. cerevisiae strain with CRISPR Cas9 system was used to construct a cell factory that can flux higher galactose from the concentrated whey medium. The improved utilization of galactose confers fermentative metabolism with improved ethanol production rate. The strain provided a high titer of the ethanol (0.32 0.007 g/g) with improved galactose flux from concentrated whey at the expense of the biomass, glycerol, and acetic acid. Our present study provides evidence that galactose to ethanol fermentation is a feasible alternative for industrial waste stream treatment in developing countries.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Diabetic nephropathy affects approximately 20%-40% of diabetes patients worldwide and is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure. Oxidative stress has been identified as a major causative factor in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy; Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) activation protects the body against oxidative stress by induction of antioxidant enzymes. The renoprotective effect of ethyl ferulate was investigated in diabetes-induced renal injury. Ethyl ferulate was administered orally at three doses (50 mg/kg, 75 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg). Metformin (500 mg/kg, p.o.) was used as a standard. Ethyl ferulate treatment decreased serum advanced glycation end products, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, renal oxidative stress, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) level, and kidney hypertrophy index. It restored serum lipid profile, biomarkers of renal function, and mitigated histopathological signs of renal damage. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated higher Nrf2 protein levels in kidney sections of ethyl ferulate-treated rats. These findings suggest that ethyl ferulate ameliorated hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress by increasing renal Nrf2 levels, thereby preventing diabetes-induced kidney injury. In conclusion, the present study endorses the usefulness of Nrf2 activators, such as ethyl ferulate, as adjuvant therapy for preventing the diabetic nephropathy. Practical applications. Ethyl ferulate (ethyl-3-hydroxyl-4-methoxycinnamate), a phenylpropanoid, is a naturally occurring ethyl ester of ferulic acid and is widely present in plants and especially grains, such as rice and maize. Our study has highlighted the renoprotective effect of ethyl ferulate in preventing diabetes-associated renal injury. The observed effect of ethyl ferulate is due to amelioration of diabetes-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, by activation of the Nrf2 pathway. These results indicate the potential of ethyl ferulate as a nutraceutical or adjuvant therapy in prevention of diabetic nephropathy. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13607					FSTA:2021-08-Aj12109
J		Arunchand Rayaroth; Singh Tomar, R.; Kumar Mishra, R.							One step selection strategy for optimization of media to enhance arachidonic acid production under solid state fermentation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Mortierella alpina is the most researched fungus for production of arachidonic acid. Arachidonic acid inclusion in diet is gaining prominence due to its potential role in brain development and age-related disease conditions. The production mainly focuses on submerged fermentation with extensive use of gas chromatography which increases the cost of optimization. The present study focuses on the optimization of arachidonic acid production by M. alpina under solid-state fermentation and developing an effective mycelial staining method as an analytical tool to replace gas chromatography. The optimization method increased the Arachidonic acid yield (41.29 mg/gds) with the supplementation of 3.0% corn gluten, 3.0% flax seed oil and 0.625% of mineral mix-3 in a soybean meal based substrate at an optimum temperature of 25 °C and initial substrate moisture content of 70.0%. For deriving an effective analytical tool, correlation was made between the responses of statistically designed submerged fermentation and solid-state fermentation trials. The comparative regression analysis of the responses i.e., the mycelial Triphenyl tetrazolium chloride staining data and the arachidonic acid values revealed a 98.0% correlation. The submerged fermentation based mycelial staining was thus devised as an effective media optimization strategy for solid state fermentation based arachidonic acid production.

Antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of sulfated polysaccharides from five different edible seaweeds.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In recent times, there has been a growing interest in the exploration of antioxidants and global trend toward the usage of seaweeds in the food industries. The low molecular weight up to 14 kDa sulfated polysaccharides of seaweeds (Portieria hornemannii, Spyridia hypnoides, Asparagopsis taxiformis, Centroceras clavulatum and Padina pavonica) were evaluated for in vitro antioxidant activities and cytotoxic assay using HeLa cell line and also characterized by FTIR. The high yield (7.74% alga dry wt.) of sulfated polysaccharide was observed in P. hornemannii followed by S. hypnoides (0.69%), C. clavulaum (0.55%) and A. taxiformis (0.17%). In the brown seaweed P. pavonica, the sulfated polysaccharide yield was 2.07%. High amount of sulfate was recorded in the polysaccharide of A. taxiformis followed by C. clavulaum, P. pavonica, S. hypnoides and P. hornemannii as indicative for bioactivity. The FTIR spectroscopic analysis supports the sulfated polysaccharides of S. hypnoides, C. clavulatum and A. taxiformis are similar to agar polymer whereas the spectral characteristics of P. hornemannii have similarities to carrageenan. The higher DPPH activity and reducing power were recorded in the polysaccharide of brown seaweed P. pavonica than the red seaweeds as follows: DPPH activities: S. hypnoides>A. taxiformis>C. clavulatum>P. hornimanii; Reducing power: A. taxiformis>P. hornimanii>S. hypnoides>C. clavulatum. The polysaccharide fractions contain up to 14 kDa from red seaweeds P. hornemannii and S. hypnoides followed by brown seaweed P. pavonica exhibit cytotoxic activity in HeLa cancer cell line (and are similar to structural properties of carrageenan extracted from P. hornemannii). The low molecular weight agar like polymer of S. hypnoides and alginate like brown seaweed P. pavonica showing better in vitro antioxidant activities that are capable of exhibiting cytotoxicity against HeLa cell line can be taken up further in-depth investigation for nutraceutical study. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Arya, S. S.; Kumar Shakya, N.							High fiber, low glycaemic index (GI) prebiotic multigrain functional beverage from barnyard, foxtail and kodo millet.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Consumers are increasingly demanding healthier and natural foods made from whole grains. In view of this, a multigrain functional beverage was made using minor millets such as barnyard, foxtail and kodo millet. Millets are rich in dietary fibre, B vitamins and micronutrients like magnesium, iron and have low glycaemic index. Roasted millets were extracted with water and filtered to obtain the beverage. An appropriate ratio of all grain was obtained from D-optimal mixture design. Accordingly, grain amount was varied from 5 to 8 g, 8-12 g, 6-9 g for barnyard, foxtail and kodo millet respectively. The ratio was selected based on pH, phenolic content, antioxidant activity and sensory overall acceptability of resultant multigrain beverages. Beverage was treated with alpha-amylase enzyme, fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, and maltitol to improve the sensorial properties. The final multigrain functional beverage was prepared from 7 g barnyard, 10 g foxtail and 8 g of kodo millet along with 1.2 g/100 g w/v of fructooligosaccharide, containing 5.72 g/100 g total dietary fibre, 47.69 mg ferulic acid equivalents (FAE) /100 mL total phenolic content with a prebiotic activity of 1.56 and 45.07 of glycaemic index (GI) which can be categorized as functional low GI beverage (GI < 55).

J		Aryan Mehta; Amanjeet Singh; Pratap Singh, A.; Pramod K. Prabhakar; Nitin Kumar							Ultrasonic induced effect on mass transfer characteristics during osmotic dehydration of aonla (Phyllanthus emblica L.) slices: a mathematical modeling approach.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					The present work aimed to investigate the effect of ultrasound pretreatment on osmotic dehydration of aonla slices. The aonla slices were subjected to an ultrasonic treatment with a frequency of 40kHz for 10 min and then subjected to osmotic dehydration in 60°Bx sucrose solution for 300min. Empirical models such as Azuara, Peleg, Weibull, Page, and Crank model were utilized to predict the kinetics of water loss and solid gain. Artificial Neural Network technique was also used to predict the parameters with immersion time and temperature as input. All models were found to have a good fit. From the analysis, the ultrasound pretreated samples were found to have enhanced rate of mass transfer compared to control samples especially at the early stages of the process. From Azuara Model, the equilibrium water loss and solid gain were ranged between 49.95-53.65g/100g and 11.10-22.01g/100g. From Crank model, the effective moisture diffusivities in osmotic dehydration were observed to be varied between 9.28*10-10-12.47*10-10 m2/s and 10.06*10-10-19.17*10-10 m2/s for atmospheric and ultrasonic conditions. While for solid gain, the values were ranged between 2.36-2.67*10-10 m2/s (untreated) and 2.49-2.73*10-10 m2/s (treated). The Vitamin C content and color of sample were found to be affected by ultrasound pretreatment (p<.05) and temperature (p<.05). The effective diffusivities attributed to have a significant Arrhenius relationship (R2 ≥ .92, p ≤ .05). The enhanced moisture loss and solid gain in the product can be explained by the microscopic channels and cell disruption caused by ultrasonic waves. Practical Application. The aonla fruit, native to South Asia, is a very important commodity because of its health and nutritional benefits. Despite its advantages, it is less popular as table fruit because of its low shelf life and astringency. Osmotic dehydration can be used to preserve the fruit, and it causes the partial removal of water from the fruit and improves its taste. Osmotic dehydration being a slow process, can be enhanced by the ultrasound application. The data and findings can be applied to produce stable intermediate moisture content food that can be used as dried fruit or additive with other food products. This study investigates the modeling of ultrasound-induced osmotic dehydration in order to design the process with low energy and cost. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	12			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13887					FSTA:2022-03-Jg3920

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					During the sea buckthorn juice production, poor physical stability and loss of bioactive substances will reduce the nutritional and commodity value of product. In this study, the sea buckthorn juice was subjected to dynamic high pressure microfluidization (DHPM) treatment with different pressures (50,75, 100,125, and 150 MPa) and different passes (1,2 and 3). The effect on physical and chemical indexes of juice was investigated. Results. Indicated that the particle size of all the treated samples became smaller (p< 0.05) compared with control, but the D[4,3] became larger in sea buckthorn juice with increasing passes number of homogenization. Besides, physical stability analysis suggested that DHPM was beneficial to improving the stability of the juice. Regarding to carotenoids content, when the samples were treated at 150 MPa for one and two passes, there were no significant changes in total carotenoids content compared with the control. In addition, it was also observed that no significant changes in alpha-carotene (except treated at 100 MPa) and beta-carotene. The results provide a basis for the improvement of sensory and nutritional quality, and the improvement of stability and bioavailability of carotenoids in sea buckthorn juice.

Food Chemistry					Gluten protein based snacks have been a major concern for allergen, low nutrition and physio-chemical properties. In this study, wheat flour (WF) was replaced with cassava starch (CS) at different levels [10,20, 30,40 and 50% (w/w)] to prepare fried snacks. The addition of CS significantly (P < 0.05) increased hardness and pasting properties while gluten network, oil uptake, water holding capacity, and expansion were decreased. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the secondary structure of amide I, alpha-helix (1650-1660 cm-1), along with amide II region (1540 cm-1) changed when CS was added. Starch-protein complex was identified by X-ray diffraction analysis while no starch-protein-lipid complex was observed. The micrographs from scanning electron microscopy showed that starch-protein matrix was interrupted when ≥40% (w/w) CS was added. Furthermore, in vitro calcium bioavailability was decreased slightly with the addition of CS. The results suggest the feasibility of adding 40% CS as an alternative to WF in snacks.

Foods					Snack foods are consumed around to globe due to their high nutrition, taste and versatility; however, the effects of various processing methods on quality, structure and oxidative properties are scare in the literature. This study aims to evaluate the effect of various processing methods (frying, baking and microwave cooking) on quality, structure, pasting, water distribution and protein oxidative properties of fish meat-based snacks. The results showed that the frying method induced a significantly (p< 0.05) higher expansion than baking and microwave methods. Texture in terms of hardness was attributed to the rapid loss of water from muscle fiber, which resulted in compact structure and the increased hardness in microwave cooking, whereas in frying, due to excessive expansion, the hardness decreased. The pasting properties were significantly higher in baking, indicating the sufficient swelling of starch granules, while low in microwave suggest the rapid heating, which degraded the starch molecules and disruption of hydrogen bonds as well as glycosidic linkage and weakening of granules integrity. The water movement assessed by Low Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR) showed that frying had less tight and immobilized water, whereas microwave and baking had high amounts of tight and immobilized water, attributing to the proper starch-protein interaction within matrix, which was also evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. The protein oxidation was significantly (p< 0.05) higher in frying compared to baking and microwave cooking. The findings suggest the endorsement of baking and microwave cooking for a quality, safe and healthy snacks. © 2021 by the authors.

M.; Pateiro, M.; Anusha Siddiqui, S.; Muhammad Inam-Ur-raheem							Effect of structurally different pectin on dough rheology, structure, pasting and water distribution properties of partially meat-based sugar snap cookies.		Foods					Pectin has been widely used as a hydrocolloid in foods, but its effectiveness based on hydrodynamics radius (Rh), average side chain length (ACL) and degree of esterification (DE) has been less studied. This study investigated the effect of 4 types of pectin (with different molecular weight and structures) at a level of 1.5% w/w of wheat flour on functional, structural and water binding properties of sugar snap cookies partially substituted with fish meat. The results showed that pectin (CU-201 and CU-601) with higher ACL and Rh controlled excessive expansion, while the improved rheology of dough in terms of behavior as viscous matrix compared to control and other pectin. Texture was found to be highly dependent on Rh and ACL compared to DE of pectin. The pasting properties, especially peak viscosity and final viscosity, were significantly (p< 0.05) increased with increasing DE, as well as ACL, by entangling and increasing the interaction between starch and pectin. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis exhibited that control sample showed wide voids and more intercellular spaces, while samples prepared with CU-601, CU-201, and CUL displayed compact structure, which was also evidenced by controlled expansion and improved hardness of the cookies. Low field nuclear magnetic resonance (LF-NMR) analysis showed that T21 relaxation time and amplitude were found to be shorter for CU-601 and CU-201 treatments, signifying the high amount of tightly bound water compared to control. The findings endorse the feasibility of adding CU-601, and CU-201 as an efficient hydrocolloid for the improved structural and functional properties of cookies. © 2021 by the authors.

Evaluation of fish meat noodles: physical property, dough rheology, chemistry and water distribution properties.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The present study reports the rheological, textural, structural and water distribution properties of fish meat noodles. The results showed that storage and loss modulus were increased when 20% fish meat was added while decreased with the addition of >20% fish meat, whereas loss rate behaved vice versa. The moisture and fat content increased significantly (P< 0.05) while water absorption index was decreased upon the increment of fish meat compared to control. Lightness of dough and hardness of noodles decreased significantly (P< 0.05) while redness and yellowness were increased. Similarly, less swelled starch granules and dominancy of protein network over starch granules were observed in microstructure. The amount of free water was increased while bound water was decreased when >20% fish meat was added during low-field nuclear magnetic resonance. The findings suggest the feasibility of adding 15-20% fish meat for the proper structure and chemistry of noodles. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	2	1061	1069	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14761					FSTA:2021-06-Rc2044

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, potato chips from different varieties were made and their storage study was conducted. The results showed that Caruso and Lady Rosetta (LR) had significantly (p<.05) highest total solids and specific gravity compared to other varieties. Significantly (p<.05) highest oil uptake (47.62%) was observed in Sterna while lowest was observed in Caruso (42.94%) and LR (43.67%), respectively. Highest lightness (62.55) and low free fatty acids (FFA) values of oil were found in LR while highest in Hermes. During storage period of 60 days, FFA, oxidation, color, and moisture values of LR and Caruso were less than Sterna and Hermes even after 4 weeks of storage showing strong stability during. Total plate count, yeast and mound count were found to be lowest in LR variety while no spoilage organisms were found. The findings suggest the appropriateness of LR and Caruso varieties with good physiochemical properties and stability during storage period. Novelty impact statement. Potato chips are consumed all around the globe, thus, screening of new potato varieties for chips making is inevitable. The results revealed that Lady Rosette has strong potential for chips owing to its good physiochemical properties and less oil uptake. In addition, the storage stability of all varieties is in the range suggesting that prepared chips can be used for 60 days. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15437					FSTA:2021-09-Jl12563

Application of chitosan-based apple peel polyphenols edible coating on the preservation of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa cv Hongyan) fruit.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study was determined to investigate the efficacy of chitosan (CS)-based apple peel polyphenols (APP) composite coatings to enhance the storage quality of strawberries. Strawberries were coated with CS-APP1 (0.25% APP), CS-APP2 (0.50%), CS-APP3 (0.75%), CS-APP4 (1.0%), and stored at 20 °C and 35-40% RH. The uncoated fruit was considered as control. The fruits were evaluated for weight loss, decay, firmness, bioactive compounds, titratable acidity, and total soluble solids (TSS). The results revealed that CS-APP coatings had a significant effect on all the tested parameters. The weight loss and decay percentage were reduced to 10.91% and 19%, respectively, in the CS-APP4 treatment group. The highest value of TSS (6.8%) was observed in the CS-APP3 treatment group on the 6th day of storage. Coatings with CS-APP4 exhibited the maximum acid content (0.78 g/100 g) as compared to the CS only (0.68 g/100 g). The total phenol content was highest (1.3 mg/g) in the CS-APP2 treatment group at the end of storage. CS-APP2 composite coating could be effectively utilized to extend the postharvest life of strawberries as it retarded the senescence and maintained quality attributes of the fruits during storage. Practical applications: Strawberry is a nutritionally rich fruit. However, it has a short shelf-life and can deteriorate quickly. Chitosan (CS) is a biopolymer that is widely used for the application of edible coating with different antioxidant agents. Although apple fruit peel is discarded as industrial waste, yet it is a good source of polyphenols and natural antioxidants. Chitosan-based APP edible coating can be used to prolong the postharvest life of strawberry as well as to minimize food processing industrial waste by utilizing apple peel as an antioxidant ingredient. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15018					FSTA:2021-05-Jf6964

Transient changes of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during dulce de leche preparation by a direct injection mass spectrometer based on proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS).		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The capacity of a direct injection mass spectrometer based on proton transfer reaction (PTR-MS) to monitor the transient changes of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) during dulce de leche production was investigated. We found a correlation between the mass fingerprint and some physio-chemical properties of the dulce de leche samples. The intensity of the selected mass fragments related to VOCs was positively correlated with the changes of solids content but negatively with that of water activity. Rheological and textural changes were also highly correlated with the intensity observed for several mass fragments. Hence, this relationship could be useful to predict the textural and rheological changes during heating a complex fluid. Although not all the correlations between physical changes and VOCs formation reflected a direct cause-effect relationship, but those results demonstrated the suitability of the PTR-MS technique to monitor the quality changes even in complex food mixture during thermal processing. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Asal Farrokh, S.; Masoud Honarvar; Ahmadi Chenarbon, H.							Mechanical and thermophysical model of date palm fiber and beet pulp composite as natural thermal insulant.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					For the transport of frozen products, it is necessary to preserve their quality and enhance their longevity. It aimed to assess the insulation performance of the composite containing date palm fiber and beet pulp in maintaining low temperature during the transport of frozen products. Therefore, this study investigated the physical, thermal, and mechanical properties of date palm fiber and beet pulp composites for different mass fractions of 0, 2.5, 7.5, and 10%, both as stand-alone and as compounds added to hemihydrate gypsum by using the response surface method to state an optimized system. Results showed that by increasing the fractions of date palm fiber and beet pulp, the density of composite samples reduced from 880.02kg/m3 to 785kg/m3; however, water absorption increased significantly (by 101.39%). The highest flexural and compressive strengths of the control were, respectively, 4.6 and 26.67MPa, whereas the lowest of said strengths were, respectively, 3.5 and 42.91MPa in samples containing 10% palm fiber and 10% beet pulp. Additionally, for the same fiber ratios, the thermal conductivity of composite samples was reduced by 67% compared to the control sample. After optimization, the best mass ratios for palm fiber and sugar beet bagasse were, respectively, 3.05% and 10%. For these samples, water absorption was 96.69%; flexural and compressive strengths were, respectively, 6.27 and 3.87MPa; thermal conductivity was 0.51W/mK; and density was 844.15kg/m3. These properties show that a composite insulant containing date palm fiber and beet pulp are a good candidate for developing thermal insulants. Practical applications. Reducing microbic growth and delaying fat and protein oxidation during the storage can increase the durability of food and agriculture products, particularly different types of meats and dairies. To this end, a safe cold cycle is necessary for proper preservation during transport and storage. Cold transport is the main part of the cold chain required for preserving the quality of freshly frozen degradable products. Therefore, in addition to cold storages and refrigerated transport vehicles, the packages are also important. The goal of this research is the progressing of a natural biocomposite that is used as thermal insulant. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	11			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13877					FSTA:2022-03-Fg0489
J		Asale, Y.; Dessalegn, E.; Assefa, D.; Abdisa, M.							Phytochemicals and antioxidant activity of different apple cultivars grown in South Ethiopia: case of the wolayta zone.		International Journal of Food Properties					Apple fruit is one of the most intensively grown and widely cultivated fruit crop in the temperate regions around the world. This study investigated sugar, vitamin C, total phenolic contents (TPC), total flavonoid contents (TFC), and antioxidant activity of three varieties (Golden delicious, Fuji rose, and Granny smith) of whole apple fruits (peel and flesh). Total sugar, reducing sugar and sucrose contents were determined by Lane and Enyon method. Folin-Ciocalteu and aluminum chloride, and standardized iodine solutions were used to determine TPC, TFC, and vitamin C, respectively. Antioxidant activity was determined using 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-Picryl-Hydrazyl (DPPH) scavenging, total antioxidant and ferric ion reducing power assays. It was found that Golden delicious cultivar contained the highest amount of total sugar (17.32 0.40 mg/100 g juice) and reducing sugar (10.04 0.30 mg/100 g juice), whereas the juice of Fuji rose variety had the highest amount of sucrose (6.90 0.35 mg/100 g of juice). The Granny Smith variety had the highest TPC (71.88 2.30 mg gallic acid equivalent per gram of dried extract) whereas the Fuji rose had the highest TFC (21.91 2.55-mg catechin equivalent per gram of dried extract). The Golden delicious cultivar had the highest vitamin C (31.48 2.18 mg/100 g of juice). The Fuji rose showed the strongest DPPH radical scavenging activity (EC50 = 86.20 2.28 g/mL), iron reducing power (EC50 = 1.93 0.66 mg/mL), and total antioxidant activity (0.46 0.08 mg butylated hydroxy toluene equivalent/g of dried extract). Based on the present investigation, it can be concluded that the significant differences in the phytochemical composition and antioxidant activity of apple fruits could be attributed to varietal differences.

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish smoked using traditional and improved kilns: levels and human health risk implications through dietary exposure in Ghana.		Food Control					The concentrations of sixteen polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in fish smoked using the traditional Chorkor, the improved Cabin and Abuesi gas fish smoker (AGFS) kilns were investigated. Fresh mackerel and barracuda were smoked using LPG gas and two firewood species and the PAH levels were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Based on consumption trends, the potential carcinogenic risks associated with consuming the products from these kilns were also assessed. The AGFS-smoked products had mean benzo (a) pyrene and PAH4 concentrations up to 0.66 and 2.52 mug/kg respectively, which were below the European Union maximum limits (2 and 12 mug/kg respectively). The benzo (a) pyrene and PAH4 concentrations were up to 3.59 and 67.99 mug/kg respectively for Cabin kiln and 15.51 and 121.60 mug/kg respectively for Chorkor kiln. Depending on the type of firewood used, the Cabin kiln produced BAP below the maximum limits when "Esa" (Celtis mildbraedii) was used, while the Chorkor kiln had levels 3 to 8 times higher than the maximum limits. The PAH4 levels in the Cabin and Chorkor products were all above the maximum limits (4 and 8 times higher respectively). Based on the frequency and quantities of smoked mackerel and barracuda consumed by an average Ghanaian adult, the potential carcinogenic risks were lowest in the gas smoked mackerel and all barracuda samples (2.72*10-6 to 1.54*10-5), moderate in the Cabin smoked mackerel (2.82*10-5 and 5.73*10-5) and highest in the Chorkor smoked mackerel (7.06*10-5 and 1.71*10-4).

J		Asensio-Grau, A.; Calvo-Lerma, J.; Heredia, A.; Andres, A.							In vitro digestion of salmon: influence of processing and intestinal conditions on macronutrients digestibility.		Food Chemistry					Salmon is the main dietary source of omega-3 lipids and contains high-biological value protein. However, processing techniques could affect macronutrient digestibility. Also, altered intestinal conditions, particularly given in pancreatic insufficiency, could threaten digestibility. This study tested both hypotheses by subjecting raw, marinated and microwave-cooked salmon to static in vitro digestion under healthy (pH 7, bile concentration 10 mM) and altered (pH 6, bile 1 or 10 mM) intestinal conditions with different pancreatin concentrations. In the standard conditions, proteolysis was not affected by processing, but lipolysis decreased in marinated (46%) and raw salmon (57%) compared to the cooked matrix (67%). In altered conditions, proteolysis and lipolysis decreased to different extents depending on the treatment. Overall, processing affected proteolysis the most (f-ratio = 5.86), while intestinal conditions were the major determinants of lipolysis (f-ratio = 58.01). This study could set the ground to establish dietary recommendations of salmon for specific population groups. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A green approach for the sustained-intestinal delivery of red chili (Capsicum annum L) extracted capsaicinoids with enhanced bioavailability.		Journal of Functional Foods					Intestinal delivery with enhanced bioavailability is of great significance for stomach irritating and pungent bioactive molecules. The present study reports the development of a pungency-masked food-grade microbeadlets for the sustained-intestinal delivery of red chili extracted capsaicinoids using fenugreek galactomannans. Capsaicinoids encapsulated microbeads (CapF) of about 250 to 400 m were prepared by a gel-phase homogenization, fluid-bed granulation followed by galactomannan coating, and characterized by NMR, FTIR, DSC, PXRD, and SEM as stable, directly compressible, free flowing amorphous beadlets with a tap density of 0.640.2 g/mL. Swelling studies, in vitro release kinetics and particle size analysis indicated the intestinal delivery of soluble capsaicinoids. Pharmacokinetic studies on Wistar rats revealed enhanced bioavailability (19-fold) of CapF when the area under plasma concentration verses time was compared with that of unformulated capsaicinoids. CapF was safe upon gastric mucosa irritation test and demonstrated significant (P < 0.05) anti-obesity effect in high fat diet-induced hypercholesteremic rats.

Determination of total phenolic, flavonoid, carotenoid, and mineral contents in peel, flesh, and seeds of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Pumpkin is an important vegetable, which has potential to be used as medicinal and functional food. Not only the pulp but also the peel and seeds of pumpkin are good sources of phytochemicals and minerals. Pumpkin peel, flesh, and seeds were dried to obtain powders, and 80% of methanolic extracts were prepared for further analyses. Among three fractions of pumpkin, higher content of total phenolics (224.611.60-mg GAE/100-g powder) and total flavonoids (139.371.07-mg CE/100-g powder) were recorded in pumpkin seeds as compared with peel and flesh, whereas higher carotenoids (35.20.49 mg/100-g powder) and beta-carotene (6.180.04 mg/100-g powder) were present in pumpkin flesh extract, when compared with peel and seeds. Pumpkin flesh, as compared with peel and seeds, contained higher values of Na, K, and Fe (17.870.22,159220.3, and 41.500.45 mg/100-g powder, respectively). Valuable amount of Zn (15.210.07 mg/100-g powder) was present in pumpkin seeds powder. Practical applications. Pumpkin parts (peel, flesh, and seeds) own high nutritional significance due to the presence of total phenolics, flavonoids, total carotenoids, and appreciable amount of macroelements and microelements. Organic waste generated as a result of pumpkin processing could effectively be utilized in different food products for the development of functional and medicinal foods. Notably, pumpkin seeds are high in zinc content, and in this situation of COVID-19 pandemic, scientific community is well aware of oxidation and mediating role of zinc for activation of enzymes in the body. Phytochemicals present in pumpkin peel, flesh, and seeds can fight against antiaging and enhance immunity. These low-cost powders from pumpkin parts can be used as a potential source of functional foods and nutraceuticals in food and medicinal industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	6			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15542					FSTA:2021-10-Jq13814

Food Control					Pine needles (Cedrus deodara) comprise curcuminoid pigments, which are natural phenolic compounds. This study aimed to investigate the effect of pine needle extract (PNE) addition 5, 10, and 20% (v/ w) on the antioxidant assay, physical, oxygen, water vapor permeability, color, and microstructures of the films were performed on scanning electron microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer, and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The films containing PNE at the concentration of 10 and 20% showed a high antioxidant assay (total phenolics, DPPH, and radical scavenging assessment by the ABTS). The PNE content increase from 5% to 20% in films decreased the oxygen permeability (0.2590.01 to 0.080.01 cm3 mm m-2 day-1 Pa-1) and water vapor permeability (2.180.02 to 1.670.11 g mm/m2 h kPa) of all films. In contrast, the thickness of films containing PNE slightly increased from 0.0320.003 to 0.0410.009 mm. PNE incorporated films had a greenish color, while neat CH film was somewhat yellowish. The notable alterations in terms of surface microstructure in the CH films containing 10 and 20% PNE were noticed. XRD illustrated the excellent compatibility between CH and PNE. CH films gained a significant antioxidant property and improved their characteristic properties by incorporating PNE, presenting a useful food packaging application.

Food Control					Aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) is the hydroxylated metabolite of aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) formed in the liver of mammals and subsequently excreted in breastmilk (BM) of mammals. Humans are exposed to AFM1 mainly through the consumption of aflatoxin contaminated milk and foods. Determining levels of AFM1 is of significant public health importance due to the risk of exposure to breastfeeding infants. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of AFM1 in BM and assess factors associated with BM AFM1 levels in mothers. Data, collected between July 2015 and July 2017, were derived from the Aflacohort study (n = 1675) in Banke district, of Province 5 in the south-west region of Nepal. AFM1 was analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography with a lower limit of detection of 0.04 ng/L (ng/L). Multivariate linear and quantile regression models were used to examine the relationship of factors with AFM1, including mother's age, food consumption and body mass index, as well as, seasonality and wealth quintiles. Approximately 94% of BM samples had detectable levels of AFM1 (geometric mean 0.78 ng/L and range 0.04 ng/L to 315.99 ng/L). The consumption of particular foods such as yogurt, milk, hydrogenated oil and ripe pumpkin was positively associated with BM AFM1 levels (p-value <0.05), while consumption of legumes was associated with lower BM AFM1 levels (p-value <0.05). Seasonal influences were significant, with BM collected in the pre-winter and winter seasons exhibiting significantly higher AFM1 levels compared to the spring (p-value <0.05). These results suggest near-ubiquitous presence of aflatoxin in the food supply of this part of Nepal, and possible exposure of AFM1 to infants through BM of mothers. The findings justify integrated strategies across the value chain and at household level to identify dietary sources of aflatoxin exposure, proper post-harvest management and monitoring for aflatoxin control and mitigation.

J		Ashogbon, A. O.							Dual modification of various starches: synthesis, properties and applications.		Food Chemistry					The problems associated with native starches (NSs) and single modified starches were stated in order to justify dual modification of various starches. Broadly, there are two types of dual modification, i.e., homogeneous dual modification and heterogeneous dual modification. The combination of two physical modifications, e.g., (extrusion/annealing); two chemical modifications, e.g., (succinylation/cross-linking) and two enzymes modification (alpha-amylase/pullulanase) falls under the former classification and the latter classification is the combination of two of each of the differently stated modifications, e.g., acetylation/annealing, extrusion/succinylation, and microwave-assisted phosphorylation, etc. The classification, synthesis, properties and applications of dually modified starches were discussed. There is an attempt to elucidate the problems of each of the single modification in order to justify dual modifications. In dual modifications, the order of reactions, the reaction conditions, the medium of reaction, and the botanical sources of the various starches are very important parameters.

Molecular basis of the anti-diabetic properties of camel milk through profiling of its bioactive peptides on dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and insulin receptor activity.		Journal of Dairy Science					The molecular basis of the anti-diabetic properties of camel milk reported in many studies and the exact active agent are still elusive. Recent studies have reported effects of camel whey proteins (CWP) and their hydrolysates (CWPH) on the activities of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and the human insulin receptor (hIR). In this study, CWPH were generated, screened for DPP-IV binding in silico and inhibitory activity in vitro, and processed for peptide identification. Furthermore, pharmacological action of intact CWP and their selected hydrolysates on hIR activity and signaling and on glucose uptake were investigated in cell lines. Results showed inhibition of DPP-IV by CWP and CWPH and their positive action on hIR activation and glucose uptake. Interestingly, the combination of CWP or CWPH with insulin revealed a positive allosteric modulation of hIR that was drastically reduced by the competitive hIR antagonist.

J		Ashraf Hajhosseini; Delaram Doroud; Anousheh Sharifan; Zohreh Eftekhari							Stress response and characterization of oil-in-water emulsions stabilized with Kluyveromyces marxianus mannoprotein.		Journal of Food Science					This study was intended to investigate physico-chemical, rheological, and emulsifying properties of oil-in-water emulsions prepared from the Kluyveromyces marxianus mannoprotein (KMM). Also, the stress-response function of the KMM emulsions was compared with that of the whey protein concentrate (WPC) emulsions in terms of zeta potential, size, and rheology. The stress experiments were conducted at different pH (3 to 9), ionic composition (0 to 500 mM NaCl), and temperatures (30 to 90 °C). The extracted KMM with a molecular weight of 107.2 kDa had 28.8% proteins and 68.22% carbohydrates. With increasing the KMM concentration to 1.5% (w/w), the zeta potential, droplet size, and apparent viscosity of the emulsions reached-35 mV, ~1 mu, and ~9 mPa. S, respectively. After applying pH, ionic composition, and temperature, the KMM emulsions were more stable than the WPC emulsions. In conclusion, KMM can be used as a bioemulsifier and be more effective in stabilizing emulsions than WPC. Practical Application. Yeasts are a rich source of natural materials. In this study, we extracted mannoproteins from the yeast cell wall and evaluated their functional properties to be used as an emulsifier in oil-in-water emulsions. The results of this study confirm that the yeast-derived mannoproteins are good at stabilizing these emulsions either in the presence or absence of different environmental conditions. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	2	454	462	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15584					FSTA:2021-05-Ae8334
J		Ashrafi Hossain; Jayadeep, A.							Infrared heating induced improvement of certain phytobioactives, their bioaccessible contents and bioaccessibility in maize.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The study investigated changes in nutraceuticals in infrared (IR) heated maize (140-200 °C), and their bioaccessible content, and bioaccessibility in the IR-140 sample (heated at 140 °C). The content omicronf alpha-tocopherol (alpha-TP), alpha-tocotrienol (alpha-TT), and total phenolics remained unchanged at all treatments. The content of gamma-TP, zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, and phytosterols reduced at 160 °C and above temperature while gamma-TT, delta-TP, delta-TT, and lutein reduced in all the treated samples. The bioaccessible content of lutein and flavonoids increased in the IR-140 sample but zeaxanthin, beta-carotene, phytosterols, and total phenolics content did not change. Bioaccessibility of lutein, beta-carotene, and flavonoids increased, yet, bioaccessibility of phenolics and phytosterols was unchanged in the IR-140 sample. Bioaccessible content and bioaccessibility of tocopherols and tocotrienols reduced in the treated sample. Total antioxidant activity (TAA) of the bioaccessible fraction of the IR-140 sample increased while free radical scavenging (DPPH assay) activity and reducing power were similar to those of untreated maize. Bioaccessibility of TAA increased and bioaccessibility of radical scavenging activity and reducing power remained unchanged in the IR-140 sample although reducing power and TAA activity in IR-140 were lower in raw maize samples. Overall, IR heating of maize resulted in increase or retention of most of the phytobioactives and antioxidant activity, and their bioaccessible content and bioaccessibility.

Food Science & Nutrition					Trueperella pyogenes is an opportunistic pathogen causing important diseases including mastitis and metritis in domestic animals such as dairy cows leading to prominent economic losses in food production industry. The aim of this study was to investigate bacterial species, antimicrobial susceptibility, and presence of virulence factor genes and genotyping of T. pyogenes isolates associated with summer mastitis cases from 22 different farms around Tehran, Iran. Fifty-five percent of dairy cows with clinical mastitis symptoms was infected by T. pyogenesis indicated that this pathogen is the most important contributor to clinical mastitis in dairy cows in the present study. A significant correlation was illustrated between presence of virulence factor genes of isolated pathogen, biochemical patterns, and the utter infected types. Multidrug resistance susceptibility observed between isolates indicated the important need for prudent use of antimicrobials in treatment of mastitis caused by T. pyogenes and increased concerning of consumer health associated with recent problems of antimicrobial resistance. The categorization of isolates was implemented into seven different clonal related types by COX-PCR at 80% of similarity cutoff with significance relationship to clonal types, CAMP test result and sampling time and biochemical profile. Regarding to the results obtained at the present study, T. pyogenes can be considered as an important typically cause of purulent and acute form of clinical bovine mastitis and loss of dairy productivity. Further studies with more sample size and high-throughput omic methods in various sampling time and areas are suggested for study of this pathogen precisely. © 2021 The Authors.

F.; Si Hong Park; Sang-Do Ha							Antibiofilm activity of carvacrol against Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm on MBEC biofilm device and polypropylene surface.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Biofilm may influence bacterial susceptibility to traditional disinfectants but identifying effective natural disinfectants as alternatives remains a great challenge to researchers. The objective of this research was to examine antibiofilm activity of carvacrol against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Listeria monocytogenes. It was found that different concentrations of carvacrol dramatically reduced the P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes biofilms developed on both the MBEC biofilm device and polypropylene surface. On the MBEC biofilm device, the biofilm reduction was 5.04 log CFU/peg at 0.06% carvacrol for P. aeruginosa, and 3.81 log CFU/peg at 0.12% carvacrol for L. monocytogenes. On the polypropylene surface, P. aeruginosa was reduced by 4.79 log CFU/cm2 at 0.06% carvacrol, and L. monocytogenes was reduced by 4.62 log CFU/cm2 at 0.12% carvacrol. Visual observations using advanced microscopy confirmed the biofilm reduction results for both bacteria. This study demonstrated that carvacrol has potential use as a natural compound to prevent P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes related contaminations of food contact surfaces. These findings suggest that carvacrol could be used to formulate new sanitizers able to inhibit P. aeruginosa and L. monocytogenes biofilms.

J		Ashrita C. Haldipur; Nagarajan Srividya							Multi-mechanistic in vitro evaluation of antihyperglycemic, antioxidant and antiglycation activities of three phenolic-rich indian red rice genotypes and in silico evaluation of their phenolic metabolites.		Foods					The study evaluated the antidiabetic potential of three traditional Indian red rice genotypes/RR (Kattuyanam/KA, Chennangi/CH & Karungkuruvai/KU) using a combination of in vitro, metabolomics (Quadrupole-Time of Flight-Liquid chromatography-Mass spectrometry/Q-TOF-LC-MS/MS), and in silico techniques. In terms of antihyperglycemic potential, KA exhibited the highest inhibitory activity against alpha-amylase; CH against alpha-glucosidase; and KU against DPPIV and PTP1B enzymes. KA exhibited the highest antioxidant activity (DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS) and greater inhibition of protein glycation compared to other RR indicating its potential to mitigate diabetic complications. The metabolomic analysis confirmed the presence of 99 phenolics in the sample extracts (KU-71, KA-70, CH-68). Molecular docking studies revealed seven metabolites to be good inhibitors of the four target enzymes and activators of insulin receptor substrate/IRS. The antihyperglycemic and oxidation-glycation reduction composite index revealed KA to have the highest overall antidiabetic potential. Hence, the RR could be utilized in functional foods with a multi-barrelled strategy for diabetes prevention/management. © 2021 by the authors.

A comparative evaluation of in vitro antihyperglycemic potential of Bamboo seed rice (Bambusa arundinacea) and Garudan samba (Oryza sativa): an integrated metabolomics, enzymatic and molecular docking approach.		Journal of Cereal Science					The study reports the in vitro antihyperglycemic potential of Bamboo seed rice/BSR, a brown rice from Bambusa arundinacea species in comparison to a traditional Indian brown rice - Garudan samba/GS from Oryza sativa species using an integrated approach. Untargeted phenolic profiling using Q-TOF-LC-MS/MS confirmed sixty-three phenolic metabolites in BSR and thirty-nine in GS. The most abundant phenolics in BSR and GS were gallic acid, 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, caffeic acid 4-O-glucoside and p-coumaric acid. Additionally, eriocitrin was abundant in BSR and cirsimaritin in GS. Predicted glycemic index determined using an in vitro starch digestibility technique indicated BSR to be a low GI variety and GS a moderate GI variety. In terms of antihyperglycemic enzyme inhibitory potential, BSR exhibited better alpha-amylase inhibition, whereas GS exhibited greater inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. This was further confirmed using molecular docking techniques which revealed that eriocitrin and cirsimaritin were strong inhibitors of alpha-amylase and DPP IV enzymes. The study thus revealed brown rice varieties from both Bambusa sp. and Oryza sp. as healthier options to white rice in the dietary management of diabetes and as good sources of several bioactive phenolic compounds.

International Sugar Journal					For the 2018 season Bundaberg Sugar installed a 4.000 m2 falling-film tube evaporator (FFTE) of the BMA design at No 1 evaporator position at Bingera Mill. This was the first installation of a FFTE into the Australian industry. An evaluation program was undertaken during the 2019 season to assess the performance with respect to heat-transfer efficiency, effect of scaling rates on heat transfer, de-entrainment efficiency of the juice droplets from the vapour outflow stream and the general operational performance. In addition, tracer studies were undertaken to determine the distribution of residence times for juice in the evaporator. Measurements were also undertaken to determine the extent of sucrose degradation occurring within the evaporator. Overall, the evaporator has performed well with respect to the above test parameters. However, the effect of scaling on heat-transfer efficiency was only able to be evaluated for typically 120 hours of operation as the mill was restricted to five-day crushing operations each week due to the small drought-affected crop. A chemical clean of the evaporator was undertaken on shutdown each week. The results of the evaluation trials are presented and operational experiences during start-up, normal operation and shutdown phases are discussed. [This paper was presented at the proceedings of the Australian Society of Sugar Cane Technologists 42nd conference held in 2021, Bundaberg, Australia].										2021	123	1471			0020-8841									FSTA:2021-12-Kc0964
J		Asiah Omar, N.; Liza Abdullah, N.; Zuraidah Zainol; Azrin Nazri, M.							Consumers' responsiveness towards contaminated canned sardine in Malaysia: does perceived severity matter?		Food Control					Incidences of food contamination often lead to behavioral changes among consumers, and the long-term outcome may jeopardize economic returns to producers. Therefore, this study aims to examine the relationship between food safety concerns, price consciousness, perceived severity, and food repurchase intention in the context of the canned sardine contamination issue in Malaysia. Moreover, the moderating and the mediating impact of perceived severity on repurchase intention are also uncovered in this study. A self-administered survey was distributed to a total of 400 respondents among consumers of canned sardine who had prior knowledge regarding canned sardine contamination. Empirical finding supported that price consciousness is related to repurchase intention. Perceived severity positively moderates the relationship between these two variables. The study results also reveal that, perceived severity fully mediates the relationship between food safety concerns and consumers' repurchase intention. This paper offers new insights into tackling food poisoning issues and addressing market sales during a food contamination outbreak.

Odorous volatiles and methoxypyrazines responsible for the musty-peanut aroma in microwave-heated sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica).		Food Science and Technology Research					Microwave heating results in the generation of odorous compounds in sliced sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica). Herein, the odorous components of microwave-heated sponge gourd were extracted, and the volatiles were separated by a solvent-assisted flavor evaporation technique. Subsequently, gas chromatography (GC)-olfactometry analysis identified 10 compounds in the aroma extract including unsaturated aliphatic aldehydes (3-hexenal; 2-octenal), alcohols (3-hexen-1-ol; 1-octen-3-ol), and ketones (1-octen-3-one; 1,5-octadien-3-one), which might be responsible for the typical green-grassy and metallic characteristics. Microwave heating could also promote the nonenzymatic browning reaction in the softened gourd to release methional and 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline, which have boiled potato and roasted-peanut odors, respectively. Furthermore, preparative GC-mass spectrometry was used to distinguish two methoxypyrazines (3,5-dimethyl-2-methoxypyrazine and 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine) responsible for a highly noticeable, unpleasant musty-peanut aroma in heated sponge gourd. Moreover, 3-isopropyl-2-methoxypyrazine might also generate an unlikeable earthy odor, resulting an off-flavor, and thus could be used as one of quality markers in sponge gourd.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, bioactive compounds from saffron (Crocus sativus L.) and sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) were extracted using ultrasound-assisted extraction method. The extracted bioactive compounds were encapsulated in sodium alginate. The encapsulation efficiency of SE (encapsulated saffron) and SBE(encapsulated sea buckthorn) was found to be 60.303%, and 64.662%, respectively. Further, the encapsulated powder were added in the wheat flour (1%) to prepare functional cookies and its effect on structural, thermal and antioxidant properties were studied. FTIR revealed a difference in the intensity of peaks between free and encapsulated saffron (SF and SE) and sea buckthorn (SBF and SBE) bioactives. DPPH scavenging activity, reducing power, total phenolic content and lipid peroxidation inhibition were performed which displayed that antioxidant activity was significantly higher. The in-vitro digestibility assay of cookies enriched with saffron and sea buckthorn showed slow digestion of cookies that means it hinders starch digestion and this approach is expected to design low glycemic bakery product for growing diabetic population of the world. Also, the cookies developed from encapsulated powder showed better consumer acceptability as compared to cookies with free bioactives.

J		Ask-Gullstrand, P.; Strandberg, E.; Bage, R.; Christensen, J. M.; Berglund, B.							Genetic parameters for reproductive losses estimated from in-line milk progesterone profiles in Swedish dairy cattle.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study assessed the extent of reproductive losses and associated genetic parameters in dairy cattle, using in-line milk progesterone records for 14 Swedish herds collected by DeLaval's Herd Navigator. A total of 330,071 progesterone samples were linked to 10,219 inseminations (AI) from 5, 238 lactations in 1,457 Swedish Red and 1,847 Swedish Holstein cows. Pregnancy loss traits were defined as early embryonic loss (1-24 d after AI), late embryonic loss (25-41 d after AI), fetal loss (42 d after AI until calving), and total pregnancy loss (from d 1 after AI until calving). The following classical fertility traits were also analyzed: interval from calving to first service, interval from calving to last service, interval between first and last service, calving interval, and number of inseminations per service period. Least squares means with standard error (LSM SE), heritabilities, and genetic correlations were estimated in a mixed linear model. Fixed effects included breed, parity (1, 2, ≥3), estrus cycle number when the AI took place, and a linear regression on 305-d milk yield. Herd by year and season of AI, cow, and permanent environmental effect were considered random effects. Extensive (approximately 45%) early embryonic loss was found, but with no difference between the breeds. Swedish Red was superior to Swedish Holstein in the remaining pregnancy loss traits with, respectively: late embryonic loss of 6.1 1.2% compared with 13.3 1.1%, fetal loss of 7.0 1.2% compared with 12.3 1.2%, and total pregnancy loss of 54.4 1.4% compared with 60.6 1.4%. Swedish Red also had shorter calving to first service and calving to last service than Swedish Holstein. Estimated heritability was 0.03, 0.06, and 0.02 for early embryonic, late embryonic, and total pregnancy loss, respectively. Milk yield was moderately genetically correlated with both early and late embryonic loss (0.52 and 0.39, respectively). The pregnancy loss traits were also correlated with several classical fertility traits (-0.46 to 0.92). In conclusion, Swedish Red cows had lower reproductive loss during late embryonic stage, fetal stage, and in total, and better fertility than Swedish Holstein cows. The heritability estimates for pregnancy loss traits were of the same order of magnitude as previously reported for classical fertility traits. These findings could be valuable in work to determine genetic variation in reproductive loss and its potential usefulness as an alternative fertility trait to be considered in genetic or genomic evaluations.

Italian Journal of Food Science					The aim of the study was to determine the main factors affecting the consumption preferences of consumers by considering the quality characteristics of drinking water according to the regions where they reside. For this purpose, the data obtained from 400 consumers living in the central districts of Igdir province were used for Factor Analysis and Two-Step Clustering Analysis. Research results reported that physiological needs of the consumers residing in region I were based on the physiological and physical quality of the water in their drinking water consumption preference, consumers in region II relied on the chemical quality of the tap water, and consumers in region III focused on the cost advantages of tap water depending on the chemical quality of tap water. Therefore, supplying differentiated bottled drinking water in hygienic conditions according to physical and physiological quality standards of drinking water for consumers in region I, ensuring the protection and access of local water resources suitable for chemical quality characteristics to consumers in region II, and maintaining the reliability of local water resources with good chemical quality and low cost of supply and sustainability of their use for consumers in region III can have positive effects on consumption satisfaction.										2021	33	2	156	165	1120-1770				10.15586/ijfs.v33i2.2040					FSTA:2022-07-Ht6291
J		Askar Ghani; Saeideh Mohtashami; Salma Jamalian							Peel essential oil content and constituent variations and antioxidant activity of grapefruit (Citrus*paradisi var. red blush) during color change stages.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Nowadays, due to the high cost of active substances extraction operations from medicinal plants, it is very important to determine the best harvest time and organ type for extraction in order to reduce costs. The peel essential oil (EO) of citrus fruits can be considered as valuable by-products of manufacturing process, or they can be considered as main products extracted from specific cultivars of citrus. The essential oil obtained from Grapefruit (Citrus * paradisi) peel, which is considered as waste, contains valuable compounds having many applications in various food, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. As regards phytochemicals content change in different stages of fruit development, an experiment was conducted to investigate the phytochemical responses in relation to EO (quantity and quality) and antioxidant compounds (total phenolic compounds, flavones and flavonols, total flavonoids, free radical scavenging activity and tannin content) of Grapefruit peel during flavedo color change stages [green stage (GS), yellowish green stage (YGS), yellow stage (YS), and pinkish yellow stage (PYS)]. Also, correlation coefficient between most important properties are studied. The results showed significant changes in grapefruit EO content and composition during different fruit maturation stages. Monoterpene hydrocarbons in EO were the most abundant components in all stages (93.87-96.80%), such that limonene identified as the major compound (90.92-93.98%). EO yield and content (0.126ml in fruit, 0.43% v/w), limonene amount and antioxidant activity (62.81%) at the YS and YGS were higher than other stages, thus fruits at YS and YGS are the best harvest time for EO extraction from grapefruit peel.

Foods					Rice is consumed as a staple food by more than half of the world's population. Due to a higher fibre and micronutrient content, brown rice is more nutritious than white rice, but the consumption of brown rice is significantly lower than that of white rice, primarily due to sensory attributes. Therefore, the present research aimed to identify the sensory attributes which drive liking of Australian-grown brown and white rice varieties. Participants (n=139) tasted and scored (9-point hedonic scale) their liking (i.e., overall liking, aroma, colour and texture) of brown and white rice types of Jasmine (Kyeema), Low GI (Doongara), and Medium grain rice (Amaroo). In addition, participants scored aroma, colour, hardness, fluffiness, stickiness, and chewiness, on Just About Right Scales. A within-subjects crossover design with randomised order (William's Latin Square design) was used with six repeated samples for liking and Just About Right scales. Penalty analyses were applied to determine the relative influence of perception of sensory attributes on consumer liking of the rice varieties. Across all varieties, white rice was liked more than brown rice due to the texture and colour, and Jasmine rice was preferred over Low GI and Medium Grain. Rice texture (hardness and chewiness) was the most important sensory attribute among all rice varieties and aroma was important for driving of liking between white rice varieties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Aslam Khan, M.; Lingyun Chen; Li Liang							Improvement in storage stability and resveratrol retention by fabrication of hollow zein-chitosan composite particles.		Food Hydrocolloids					Solid and hollow particles based on zein have been prepared for the encapsulation of bioactive components. Hollow particles have many advantages over their solid counterpart, due to increased surface area, low density, and sustained release, emerged as a promising delivery system for polyphenols. It is necessary to improve the stability of zein particles for the encapsulation of bioactive components. The current work aims to prepare hollow zein particles by employing chitosan coating and explore the potential of the composite particles for the encapsulation and protection of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol. Hollow zein (HZ) and zein-chitosan (HZ-CH) particles were characterized in terms of size, surface charge, morphological structure, particle yield and antioxidant activity. Encapsulation of resveratrol in the zein matrix was studied by the help of fluorescence, infrared and X-ray diffraction techniques. The composite particles were also subjected to storage and in vitro digestion. Particle yield was greater than 90% when the concentrations of chitosan were greater than 0.02%. HZ-CH particles were positively charged and bigger in size as compare to HZ particles. Resveratrol entrapment caused an apparent increase in the size of the particles. The highest encapsulation efficiency and loading capacity of resveratrol were 91% and 14% in the hydrophobic zein shell of HZ-CH particles, respectively. The chitosan coating improved the storage and digestion stability of resveratrol-loaded hollow zein particles and the storage stability of encapsulated resveratrol and exhibited a sustained in vitro release of resveratrol. Therefore, the hollow zein composite particles could be used as an efficient delivery system for resveratrol in the development of functional foods.

Food Bioscience					Wheat germ oil (WGO) contains high amounts of tocopherols, phytosterols, and carotenoids. The high amount of unsaturated fatty acid content of WGO increases sensitivity to oxidative degradation. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of WGO microencapsulation in buttermilk (BM) to prevent oxidative degradation. A mixture consisting of WGO:BM (1:2) and water (60%) was emulsified by a high-pressure homogenizer, and then freeze-dried. Both bulk and microencapsulated WGO samples were kept at 60 °C for 24 days to evaluate oxidative stability, changes in contents of tocopherol, phytosterol, and carotenoid. Peroxide and p-anisidine values of microencapsulated WGO were significantly lower than the bulk WGO throughout the storage days (p < 0.05). Similarly, tocopherols, phytosterols, and carotenoid contents degraded less in microencapsulated WGO than those in bulk WGO (p < 0.05). Improved stability of the sensitive compounds in WGO through microencapsulation can extend the potential use of WGO's as a functional ingredient in food formulations.

The effect of different drying air temperatures (50, 60, and 70 °C) was then evaluated on the physico-chemical properties of foam-mat dried aquafaba powder. Different drying temperatures were significantly affected the color parameters (L* and a*) of powders (p<.05). An increase in the temperature also resulted in a decrease of 1.63-, 1.40-, and 1.42- fold in moisture, water activity, and wettability, respectively, and a 1.22-fold increase in hygroscopicity. Finally, solubility and water absorption index of powders effected no significantly with different drying temperature (p>.05). Practical applications. Aquafaba have high protein content and health-promoting ingredients such as polyphenols and generally discarded as food waste. Aquafaba have high water content and limited shelf life, so the drying process is provided some advantages such as small volume and storage space, easy transportation, and long shelf life. Foam-mat drying process was successfully application for sensitive products due to rapid drying at lower temperature, retention of high nutrition, easy reconstitution characteristics, and cost-effective. The aquafaba powder can be used in bakery products, snacks, beverages, and ice creams in the food industry. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aslaner, G.; Sumnu, G.; Sahin, S.							Encapsulation of grape seed extract in rye flour and whey protein-based electrospun nanofibers.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The objective of this research was to incorporate grape seed extract (GSE) into electrospun nanofibers produced from rye flour, whey protein concentrate (WPC), and polyethylene oxide (PEO). The effects of rye flour concentration (4% and 6%) and heating methods (conventional and microwave) on the properties of solutions and nanofibers were studied. Rheology results showed that microwave-heated solutions containing 6% rye flour had higher viscosity. According to the SEM images, the developed fibers obtained from this solution had larger diameter as compared to the ones obtained from conventionally heated solutions. Microwave pretreatment resulted in beadless and homogeneous fibers. GSE addition had a positive effect on viscosity and diameter size of microwave-heated samples. The physical and thermal properties of GSE encapsulated nanofibers were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), water vapor permeability (WVP), differential scanning calorimeter (DSC), thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analyses. The GSE addition made strong interactions within polymer matrix which improved thermal stability of films. Although GSE was not so stable at high pH environment, antioxidant activities of GSE containing samples with 4% and 6% rye flour were found to be 41.62 and 42.78%, respectively. GSE loading efficiency of electrospun nanofibers was improved with increasing rye flour concentration from 54.16 to 61.15%, and loading efficiency was improved with increased rye flour content. The results showed that rye flour and GSE are good candidates for electrospinning application, and their nanofiber films can be suggested to be used in combination with other materials as multilayered packaging. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Journal of Food Quality					The antibacterial effects of essential oils (EOs) extracted from Thymus capitatus and Thymus algeriensis were assessed and evaluated against four pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19118), Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923), and Salmonella typhimurium (ATCC 1402)) and one spoilage bacterium (Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853)). Both investigated EOs presented significant antimicrobial activities against all tested bacteria with a greater antibacterial effect of T. capitatus EO. In fact, the results indicated that the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of T. capitatus EO are in the range of 0.006-0.012% and 0.012-0.025%, respectively, while those of T. algeriensis EO ranged between 0.012 and 0.025% and 0.05%, respectively. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of both EOs were appraised against the spoilage bacterium P. aeruginosa, inoculated in minced beef meat, at two different loads (105and 108 CFU) mixed with different concentrations of EOs (0.01,0.05,1, and 3%) and stored at 4 °C for 15 days. The obtained data demonstrated that the antibacterial effect of tested EOs varies significantly in regard to the levels of meat contamination and the concentrations of EOs. In fact, in the presence of 0.01 and 0.05% of oils, a decrease in bacterial growth was observed; but, such an effect was more pronounced in the presence of higher concentrations of EOs (1 and 3%), regardless the level of meat contamination. Besides, at the low contamination level, both EOs exerted a rapid and a more pronounced antibacterial effect, as compared to the high contamination level. The results illustrated the efficacy of both EOs as preservatives in food against well-known pathogens of food-borne diseases and food spoilage, particularly in P. aeruginosa in beef meat. As regards sensory evaluation, the presence of T. capitatus EO proved to improve the sensory quality of minced beef meat.

J		Asma Shaari, N.; Ahmad Tarmizi, A. H.; Md Sikin, A.							In-house validation of accelerated solvent extraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry for the determination of bound 3- and 2-monochloropropanediols (MCPD) and glycidol in food products.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The study aimed to establish the detection method for bound 3-, 2-MCPD, and glycidol using accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The ASE was modified for reduced solvent volume and process time to extract lipid from the chocolate spread, infant formula, potato chips, and sweetened creamer. The solvent selected for ASE was a mixture of iso-hexane and acetone at 100 °C with the lipid and analyte recovery ranging from 96.9% to 98.6% and 84.1% to 107.5%, respectively. The derivatisation of analytes was adopted from the AOCS method Cd29a-13 for GC-MS analysis. The results showed that the coefficient of determination (R2) of all analytes was >0.99. The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.1 mg kg-1 expressed in lipid basis for both bound 3-and 2-MCPD and 0.2 mg kg-1 expressed in lipid basis for bound glycidol. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.3 mg kg-1 expressed in lipid basis for both bound 3-and 2-MCPD and 0.6 mg kg-1 expressed in lipid basis for bound glycidol. A blank spiked with 3-monochloropropanediols fatty acid esters (MCPDE) and 2-MCPDE (0.3, 2.1, and 7.2 mg kg-1) and glycidol esters (0.6, 4.7, and 16.6 mg kg-1) were chosen for accuracy and precision tests. The recoveries were 91.7% to 105.9%. Both repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility of the analysis were within the acceptable level of precision ranging from 1.7% to 16%. This is the first time that a full validation procedure extending to both accuracy and precision tests has been carried out for sweetened creamer and chocolate spread. Overall, the combined protocol of ASE and AOCS Cd29a-13 was successfully validated for both solid and liquid food samples with lipid content from 10% to 30%. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	2	223	236	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1845400					FSTA:2021-06-Ka0498

Abdelfatah							Genotypic characterization and antimicrobial resistance of Vibrio cholerae and Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolated from milk, dairy products, and humans with respect to inhibitory activity of a probiotic Lactobacillus rhamenosus.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Several species of Vibrio were identified in 4% of total examined samples with the highest isolation in human stool samples. Vibrio cholerae (V. cholerae) was highly isolated in raw milk (66.7%), whereas Vibrio parahaemolyticus (V. parahaemolyticus) was highly isolated in yoghurt (75%) out of the positive samples. The tested cholera toxin (ctxAB), haemolysin toxin (hlyA) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (tcpA) associated-virulence genes were identified in all V. cholera isolates. However, the thermostable direct haemolysin (tdh) and the thermostable direct haemolysin-related haemolysin (trh) associated-virulence genes were identified in 33.3% and 16.7% of the examined V. parahaemolyticus isolates, respectively. The multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index ranged from 0.15 to 0.54. Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus polymerase chain reaction showed a higher respective discriminatory power to V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus (D = 0.93 and D = 1, respectively) isolates. Lactobacillus rhamnosus (L. rhamnosus) probiotic activity on V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus can eliminate or significantly reduce the number of bacteria. In conclusion, most V. cholerae and V. parahaemolyticus isolates exhibited resistance to multiple antimicrobial classes. However, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and meropenem were recommended to treat vibriosis. L. rhamnosus could be used as an effective and applicable method for controlling antimicrobial-resistant Vibrio isolates.

Food Bioscience					Novel food-based approaches are being developed to provide micronutrients without any changes in feeding practices. The current research aims to produce an enriched couscous, nutritionally improved with adequate technological, microbiological, cooking and sensory qualities. Three lentil semolina ratios (25, 50 and 75%) were added to wheat couscous and then compared each other. The results showed a significant (p < 0.05) enhancement of the proteins and iron contents, for all the ratios. Besides, a significant (p < 0.05) increase was noticed for the ash, fibers, potassium, phenolic compounds, tannins, flavonoids and anti-radical activity values, for all the ratios. While the sodium content significantly (p < 0.05) increased at 75% substitution ratio. Contrariwise, the moisture, fat and carbohydrates revealed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease. Otherwise, the technological parameters of enriched couscous at 25% ratio of lentil semolina were the closest to those of wheat couscous. Additionally, the microbiological quality of enriched couscous was improved allowing an extension of couscous shelf life. However, the water solubility index and disintegration degree presented the limiting factors for the wheat couscous substitution with lentil semolina. Thus, enriched-couscous at 25% ratio of lentil semolina is recommended. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	42				2212-4292				10.1016/j.fbio.2021.101062					FSTA:2021-12-Mq7501

Journal of Food Science					To guarantee food safety and sustainability, it is necessary to verify meat authenticity. This study focused on the development of single nucleotide polymorphism-based polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (SNP-based PCR-RFLP) and forensically informative nucleotide sequence (FINS) methodologies based on PCR amplification of the mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene for discrimination of six red meat species, that is, cattle, buffalo, goat, sheep, camel, and donkey. FINS allowed the unambiguous identification of all species analyzed. In addition, six SNPs, where a restriction site for TasI could be localized using a preliminary in silico analysis, gave a unique RFLP pattern for each species. The results revealed a low level of species substitution (8%) in the tested meat samples. In particular, one buffalo and goat samples have been substituted with cow and sheep, respectively. Finally, the developed techniques herein showed high potentials to be routinely used as reliable and fast tools to avoid meat species substitutions. Practical Application. This research deals with genetic techniques to trace meats.

Alsaleem							Effect of fat extraction methods on the fatty acids composition of bovine milk using gas chromatography.		Food Science & Nutrition					Milk fat is a complex natural fat and contains around 400 fatty acids. The objectives of this study were to extract fat from bovine milk using two different methods, including Bligh and Dyer and Mojonnier, and to determine the fatty acid content in the extracted fats using gas chromatography (GC). No differences (p>.05) were detected in the fat content and fatty acids content as a percentage of total fat (FA%TF) extracted using both methods. No differences (p>.05) were detected in some saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and unsaturated fatty acids (USFAs) extracted from both methods, such as C11:0 (undecylic acid), C16:0 (palmitic acid), C18:0 (stearic acid), C14:1 (myristoleic acid), and C16:1 (palmitoleic acid). However, the majority of SFAs were different (p<.05) in Mojonnier method as compared to Bligh and Dyer method and vice versa for USFAs. The short (6.54% vs. 5.95%) and medium (21.86% vs. 20.73%) chains FAs determined by GC were high in Mojonnier fat as compared to Bligh and Dyer fat, while the long-chain FAs were higher in the last (66.61%) relative to Mojonnier fat (65.51%). This study found that Mojonneir method has resulted in fewer errors. In contrast, the Bligh and Dyer extraction method has more experimental error, which led to decreasing the total fat, as well as was not able to detect C9:0. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Asmae, E. G.; Nawal, E. M.; Bakour, M.; Lyoussi, B.							Moroccan monofloral bee pollen: botanical origin, physicochemical characterization, and antioxidant activities.		Journal of Food Quality					In this study, eight monofloral bee pollen samples were collected from different apiaries in Morocco. Botanical origins of the bee pollen samples were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the physicochemical parameters (pH, moisture, ash, and the mineral contents) were determined. Total phenolic, flavones/flavonols contents were evaluated, and the antioxidant potential was assessed using total antioxidant capacity, DPPH, ABTS, and reducing power assays. Data showed that pH, moisture, and ash content values ranged between 4.190.17 and 4.820.36,10.70.04% and 26.80.01%, and 1.810.10% and 4.220.08%, respectively. Potassium and magnesium were the most abundant minerals in bee pollen samples; heavy metals were not detected except for two samples (P5 and P6) where a very small amount of lead was found. The protein content in these samples varied between 19.860.36mg/100g and 30.320.12mg/100g of bee pollen. The phenolic content, flavones/flavonols content, and total antioxidant capacity were 21.871.80mgEAA/g, 2.370.16mgEAA/g, and 6.230.21mgEAA/g, respectively. High scavenging activity of DPPH and ABTS radicals was found in P2 with the lower IC50 of 0.2450.009mg/ml and 0.190.005mg/ml, respectively. The lower EC50 was 0.1330.036mg/ml found in P1 for the reducing power test. The current study is considered to be the first step to the standardization of Moroccan bee pollen.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					There is a growing global demand for teff (Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter) grain due to its gluten-free nature, high level of essential amino acids, high mineral content, low glycemic index, high crude fiber content, longer shelf life, and slow staling of its bread products compared to those of wheat, sorghum, rice, barley, and maize. However, only a limited and less reliable data exists on phenolic profiles of teff grain. This article aimed at exploring phenolic contents and chemical compositions of four teff grain samples (two white and two brown) as well as their in vitro antioxidant capacity. Identification of individual bioactive compounds in white teff was also conducted using UPLC-qTOF-MS. In general, teff grain was found to have a much higher phenolic content compared to other commonly consumed grains and pseudo cereals; brown teff contained higher than the white one. Antioxidant activity was also relatively higher than other common whole flour food sources. Furthermore, combination of UPLC separation, qTOF-MS detection and automated data processing software with scientific library using UNIFI ver. 1.8 allowed us to identify a total of 61 bioactive compounds mainly phenolic compounds and saponins in teff for the first time. The findings of this study significantly contribute to enhancing the limited data on teff phenolics. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5392	5407	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01113-3					FSTA:2022-07-Mg4207

N.; Setyo Purnomo, A.; Ansharullah; Ahmad Fudholi							The effect of heat moisture treatment on crystallinity and physicochemical-digestibility properties of purple yam flour.		Food Hydrocolloids					Purple yam flour was successfully modified by heat moisture treatment (HMT) in three cycles using an oven (OHMT) and autoclave (AHMT) (100 °C and 120 °C; moisture level: 15%, 22%, and 30%). X-ray diffraction (XRD) and FTIR were used to characterize the molecular structural change due to thermal treatment. The native and modified purple yam flours' swelling capacity, solubility, and digestibility (RDS, SDS, and RS) parameters were studied. The OHMT and AHMT treatments decreased swelling capacity, solubility, and RDS, while RS and SDS increased compared to native. FT-IR analysis showed an absorption band decrease at 930, 1022, 1080, 1155-1150, 1641, 2930, and 3400 cm-1 for the modified flours. After HMT, the Diffractogram pattern showed starch type change from B to A with four core peaks at 2theta: 15°; 17°; 18° and 23°. OHMT and AHMT increased the relative crystallinity of all samples except OHMT215 (oven temperature: 120 °C and moisture level: 15%) to 30.80%. This study indicated that the two treatments improved purple yam's functional properties, therefore it is potentially applied in many food industries.

Biotransformation of the Brazilian Caatinga fruit-derived phenolics by Lactobacillus acidophilus La-5 and Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 impacts bioaccessibility and antioxidant activity.		Food Research International					This study aims to evaluate the effect of fermentation of fruit purees (seriguela, mangaba, mango, and acerola) with Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 and/or Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-05 on the profile and bioaccessibility of phenolics and antioxidant activity. The physicochemical parameters and sugar and organic acid contents were also measured for evaluating the fermentation system. Fruit purees were adequate substrates for the growth of probiotic cultures, presenting high viability in the product and after simulated gastrointestinal conditions (≥7 log CFU/g). The fermentation with probiotic cultures increased the lactic acid (8.45-15.44 mg/mL), acetic acid (0.05-1.05 mg/mL), and phenolic contents and bioaccessibility, while the pH values and glucose and fructose contents were decreased (p < 0.05 ). L. acidophilus was found in higher counts in seriguela puree (8.000.03), resulting in a higher consumption of maltose, fructose, and glucose, increased phenolic compounds content and bioacessibility and higher antioxidant activity (p< 0.05). The co-cultivation of both probiotic strains showed promising results for mango, mangaba and seriguela purees, resulting in an increased content and bioaccessibility of phenolics and higher antioxidant activity (p< 0.05). Our findings demonstrate for the first time that the Brazilian Caatinga fruit-derived phenolics can be biotransformed by Lactobacillus and amended genera probiotics to bioaccesible phenolics with antioxidant activity. The knowledge obtained from this study will provide fundamental concepts of the use of synergistic probiotics for future fermentation of other fruit purees to increase the bioaccesibility and antioxidant activity of biotransformed phenolic compounds.

Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in bovine meat and meat products over the last 15 years in Brazil: a systematic review and meta-analysis.		Meat Science					We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the rate of contamination in bovine meat and meat products with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) in Brazil over the last fifteen years. Data were obtained from online databases in February 2020, and 25 papers were selected from 1036 articles identified in the literature search and 13 articles from gray literature, totaling 4286 samples analyzed. The overall rate of STEC was estimated to be 1% in Brazil. The highest rate (9%) was observed in Mato Grosso, followed by Rio Grande do Sul (1%), Goias (1%), and Sao Paulo (1%). Regarding the sample type analyzed, hot carcasses had the highest rate (8%) of positive samples for STEC, followed by cold carcasses (2%) and beef samples (1%). As the available data were concentrated in the Sao Paulo state, the findings of this meta-analysis reveal the need for further studies in Brazil to allow better risk assessment and prevention of human STEC infections.

Active food packaging of cellulose acetate: storage stability, protective effect on oxidation of riboflavin and release in food simulants.		Food Chemistry					In this work, cellulose acetate films were prepared with the incorporation of different carotenoids (lycopene, norbixin, and zeaxanthin). The effect of adding these natural antioxidants was evaluated through stability during storage under controlled conditions (temperature and light), degradation rate coefficient, release in food simulants and protective effect on oxidation of vitamin B2. During storage at 25 °C or 40 °C the light showed a greater effect on the stability of the carotenoids, with significant increase in reaction constants (k) and decrease in half-life (t1/2). The degradation of the carotenoids was followed by a variation in the color parameters and mechanical properties. The films with norbixin showed the highest barrier to the transmission of UV-Vis light, consequently preserving 72% of a vitamin B2 stored under a photooxidative environment. Lycopene presented a higher release rate than norbixin and zeaxanthin to a fatty food simulant. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Genomic and transcriptomic analysis of biofilm formation in persistent and transient Listeria monocytogenes isolates from the retail deli environment does not yield insight into persistence mechanisms.		Foodborne Pathogens and Disease					Persistence of Listeria monocytogenes in retail deli environments is a serious food safety issue, potentially leading to cross-contamination of ready-to-eat foods such as deli meats, salads, and cheeses. We previously discovered strong evidence of L. monocytogenes persistence in delis across multiple states. We hypothesized that this was correlated with isolates' innate characteristics, such as biofilm-forming capacity or gene differences. To test this hypothesis, we sequenced the genomes of 21 L. monocytogenes isolates previously collected longitudinally from the retail deli environment. Isolates were chosen to represent varying attachment capacity and sanitizer tolerance as well as persistence or transience. We used single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis to characterize the isolates' genetic relationships and used BLAST to search the isolates' genomes for antibiotic resistance elements, quaternary ammonium tolerance genes, and stress survival islets. We further chose four isolates for RNA-sequencing analysis and compared their global biofilm transcriptome with their global planktonic transcriptome. We did not find genetic content that explained persistence. The presence of stress survival islet-1 correlated to increased attachment capacity (p< 0.05), but not persistence. Further, the presence of sanitizer tolerance elements was not significantly correlated with phenotypic sanitizer tolerance. Analysis of biofilm versus planktonic gene expression did not show the expected differences in gene expression patterns. Overall, L. monocytogenes persistence in the deli environment is likely a matter of poor sanitation and/or facility design, rather than isolates' biofilm-forming capacity, sanitizer tolerance, or genomic content.

J		Assunacao, R.; Twaruzek, M.; Kosicki, R.; Viegas, C.; Viegas, S.							Drinking green tea: despite the risks due to mycotoxins, is it possible to increase the associated health benefits?		Toxins					Tea has been consumed for thousands of years. Despite the different varieties, particular emphasis has been placed on green tea (GT), considering the associated health benefits following its regular consumption, some of which are due to its polyphenol constituents, such as epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Tea is not prone to the growth of microorganisms, except fungus, when proper storage, handling, and packing conditions are compromised. Consequently, mycotoxins, secondary metabolites of fungi, could contaminate tea samples, affecting human health. In the present study, we aimed to assess the balance between risks (due to mycotoxins and high levels of EGCG) and benefits (due to moderate intake of EGCG) associated with the consumption of GT. For this, 20 GT samples (10 in bulk and 10 in bags) available in different markets in Lisbon were analyzed through a LC-MS/MS method, evaluating 38 different mycotoxins. Six samples revealed detectable values of the considered toxins. Current levels of mycotoxins and EGCG intake were not associated with health concerns. Scenarios considering an increasing consumption of GT in Portugal showed that drinking up to seven cups of GT per day should maximize the associated health benefits. The present study contributes to the future establishment of GT consumption recommendations in Portugal. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Combination of carotenoids from Spirulina and PLA/PLGA or PHB: new options to obtain bioactive nanoparticles.		Food Chemistry					The use of poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) is an alternative polymer that can be considered environment friendly and renewable to prepare nanoparticles of carotenoids. This study aimed to develop and characterize aqueous dispersion nanoparticles and lyophilized nanoparticles of carotenoid extract obtained from Spirulina sp. LEB 18 by nanoprecipitation, using polyd, l-lactic acid (PLA) /polyd, l-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) (75:25 w/w) or PHB as encapsulants. The samples were characterized for the particle size, polydispersity index, zeta potential, apparent viscosity, pH, color parameters, ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis) spectrophotometry, carotenoid profile, encapsulation efficiency, morphology, and thermal analysis. Nanoparticles containing microalgae carotenoid extract showed average particle diameter on a nanoscale (<200 nm), high homogeneity and stability, high thermal stability, and encapsulation efficiency carotenoid (>80%) when compared to nanoparticles containing beta-carotene synthetic. PHB or PLA/PLGA as encapsulating material in the production of nanoparticles from microalgae carotenoids can be a polymeric alternative capable of promoting greater stability and application of carotenoids.

J		Astha Sharma; Anju K. Dhiman; Surekha Attri; Preethi Ramachandran							Studies on preparation and preservation of persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) pulp.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study was conducted to prepare and preserve persimmon pulp using different preservation methods along with their evaluation for quality and storage stability. The maximum pulp recovery of 88.30% was obtained by hot pulping of persimmon fruits with peel (T3). T3 treatment selected for further studies on the basis of higher sensory scores possessed 0.61 mg/100 g beta-carotene, 8.71 mg/100 g, ascorbic acid, 2.91% crude fibre, 6.41 mg/100 g total phenols, and 62.35% antioxidant activity. The preservation of pulp reflected that the persimmon pulp of treatment T1 (pulp+ KMS @ 2,000 ppm in glass jars) retained higher ascorbic acid, beta-carotene, total phenols, and antioxidant activity during 6 months of storage period. Henceforth, it is concluded that ripe Hachiya persimmon which otherwise is processed to a limited extent, can be successfully converted into pulp and utilized in various products to improve their nutritional quality. Practical applications. Persimmon is highly perishable climacteric fruit that may deteriorate quickly when stored at ambient temperature. The fruit, even in convenient storage conditions, has a limited shelf life compared with other fruits. Therefore, after harvesting, a significant amount of mature persimmons should be processed into certain products to preserve the fruit's bioactive components and maintain overall quality. The lack of consistent information on the storage and transport factors leads to losses at the end of production process as well as during the marketing of the fruit. These losses are due to excessive ripening, loss of firmness, rot, and peel browning. But processing of persimmon is a challenge owing to its mushiness when ripe as it is a climacteric fruit. Henceforth, various methods are employed to extract pulp in order to get the maximum yield and retain nutritional and functional quality. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15274					FSTA:2021-08-Jg10418

An optimized method for sample preparation and elemental analysis of extra-virgin olive oil by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.		Food Chemistry					The accurate determination of trace elements in vegetable edible oils is still an analytical challenge, owing to their low concentration levels and the complex matrix of the vegetable oils. The aim of this study was to develop a fast and simple analytical method to quantify 45 elements in small mass samples (0.5 g) of extra virgin olive oils by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. To evaluate the best and fastest sample preparation procedure, ultrasonic extraction and wet digestion methods were compared using oil certified reference material with different reagent mixtures, reagent volumes, and times for sample extraction or digestion. The use of 5 mL reagent mixture F [10% (v/v) HNO3 and H2O2, 2:1 (v/v)] for sample digestion in a water bath (95 °C, 40 min) was found to produce satisfactory results in all cases as validated from sample recovery experiments over three different extra virgin olive oil samples.

Metal and metalloid profile as a fingerprint for traceability of wines under any Galician protected designation of origin.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Effective and cheap methods for detecting fraud and, guaranteeing wine authenticity, are of paramount importance in the sector. In this sense, three different kinds of prediction models (random forest, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines) were developed to classify wines, according to their element contents (metals and metalloids, obtained using an inductively coupled plasma with a quadrupole mass spectrometer, and an optic emission spectrophotometer). One models were developed using 45 inputs variables, and then the models were subjected to a process of reducing variables to simplify models and save material and time costs. A total accuracy was reached in all phases for the white wines-random forest models. From a practical point of view, the accuracy and the errors obtained by the selected models (except for red wines-artificial neural network developed using reduced variables) are acceptable. The models developed with fewer variables, can make the prediction task easier. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	102				0889-1575				10.1016/j.jfca.2021.104043					FSTA:2021-11-Hj10990
J		Astray, S. B.; Barbosa-Pereira, L.; Lage-Yusty, M. A.; Lopez-Hernandez, J.							Comparison of analytical methods for the rapid determination of melatonin in food supplements.		Food Analytical Methods					Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland and extra-pineal tissues with chronobiotic effects that can alter the circadian rhythms, among other health benefits. This study intended to compare two different methods, high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a variable wavelength detector plus a fluorescence detector (HPLC-VWD-FLD) and constant-wavelength synchronous spectrofluorimetry, to determine melatonin in food supplements. HPLC-MS/MS was used as a confirmatory technique. The data showed that both analytical methodologies were valid for the determination of melatonin with correlation between the datasets obtained (99% confidence level). Constant-wavelength synchronous spectrofluorimetry is a fast, simple, and economical method that can be used for a rapid and precise determination of melatonin in supplements, in the absence of other compounds that could interfere in the analysis. On the other hand, the HPLC-VWD-FLD method showed to be more suitable for the determination of melatonin in complex samples because of its high sensitivity and separation efficiency. Finally, all supplements analyzed from the Spanish market comply with the melatonin content declared on the label and with the claim "contributes to the alleviation of subjective feelings of the jet lag of jet lag" (0.5 mg/day). Also, 7 out of 10 complain about the claim "contributes to the reduction of time taken to fall asleep" (1 mg/day). ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

J		Asutosh Mohapatra; Jatindra K. Sahu							Spray-process optimization for the encapsulation of probiotic Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 11975 in a ternary wall matrix.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The inlet air temperature and feed flow rate of a spray drying process were optimized for encapsulation of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 11975 using a ternary wall matrix of skim milk powder, maltodextrin, and cellulose acetate phthalate. The combined effect of inlet air temperature (140, 150, and 160 °C) and feed flow rate (2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 ml/min) was studied on the encapsulation efficiency (EE), survival rate (SR), moisture content (MC), recovery yield (RY), and water activity (aw) by creating response surface plots in a full factorial design. A significant (p<.05) decrease in EE, SR, MC and aw, and increase in RY values of the powder were noticed by increasing the temperature and decreasing the feed rate. The optimum conditions to produce maximally viable probiotic powder were 145 °C and 2 ml/min. The shape of the particles was spherical. Thermal characterization revealed a better storage stability with a low inactivation rate. Practical applications. Achieving a higher survival rate of probiotics to confer adequate health benefits to human gut is the prime concern of this research which was successfully achieved by optimizing the spray drying parameters. This manuscript details the potential application of a ternary wall matrix composite consisting of skim milk powder, maltodextrin, and cellulose acetate phthalate to successfully encapsulate the probiotic strain of Lactobacillus acidophilus, with improved encapsulation properties. The study will help towards formulating a novel dairy-based probiotic food with enhanced gut microbiota by generating the necessary background data required. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	10			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15860					FSTA:2022-01-Ad0972
J		Aswath Shruthi, P.; Pushpadass, H. A.; Emerald, F. M. E.; Surendra Nath, B.; Laxmana Naik							Formulation and characterization of catechin-loaded proniosomes for food fortification.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. To overcome the problems associated with niosomes, proniosomes-a dry powder-was prepared to nanoencapsulate catechins using Span 60 as surfactant, cholesterol as stabilizer and maltodextrin, lactose monohydrate and pullulan as wall materials. The proniosomes were made by the thin-film hydration technique, and were characterized for fortification in milk beverages. Scanning and atomic force microscopic images showed the varying morphology and ultrastructure of the proniosomes. The mean hydrodynamic diameter of 193.57-262.52 nm, polydispersity index of 0.24-0.25 and zeta potential of -15.8 to -24.73 were suggestive of the size, homogeneity and stability of the catechin-loaded proniosomes. X-ray powder diffractograms and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra provided insight about the interaction between catechins and wall materials. Entrapment efficiency and in vitro release were calculated to determine the extent of nanoencapsulation of catechins and their bioavailability, respectively. The nanoencapsulates were fortified in milk and yogurt to find their organoleptic acceptability. Results. Moisture content was found to be 20-30 gkg-1, indicating longer stability of the proniosomes. Scanning electron microscopic and atomic force microscopic images revealed the ultrastructure and spherical-shaped morphology of proniosomes. Entrapment efficiency of catechins using pullulan as wall material was as high as 83.43%. In vitro release studies revealed the sustained release of catechins from the proniosomes. FTIR and X-ray diffraction spectra revealed the absence of chemical interactions between catechins and encapsulants. Conclusion. Food-grade proniosomes are a good vehicle for fortification of milk and yogurt without noticeable adverse changes in their organoleptic and physicochemical properties, thus increasing the potential for bioavailability of catechins in the gastrointestinal tract. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2439	2448	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10868					FSTA:2021-07-Pa3520
J		Aswathi Soni; Al-Sarayreh, M.; Reis, M. M.; Brightwell, G.							Hyperspectral imaging and deep learning for quantification of Clostridium sporogenes spores in food products using 1D-convolutional neural networks and random forest model.		Food Research International					Clostridium sporogenes spores are used as surrogates for Clostridium botulinum, to verify thermal exposure and lethality in sterilization regimes by food industries. Conventional methods to detect spores are time-consuming and labour intensive. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the feasibility of using hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and deep learning approaches, firstly to identify dead and live forms of C. sporogenes spores and secondly, to estimate the concentration of spores on culture media plates and ready-to-eat mashed potato (food matrix). C. sporogenes spores were inoculated by either spread plating or drop plating on sheep blood agar (SBA) and tryptic soy agar (TSA) plates and by spread plating on the surface of mashed potato. Reflectance in the spectral range of 547-1701 nm from the region of interest was used for principal component analysis (PCA). PCA was successful in distinguishing dead and live spores and different levels of inoculum (102 to 106 CFU/ml) on both TSA and SBA plates, however, was not efficient on the mashed potato (food matrix). Hence, deep learning classification frameworks namely 1D-convolutional neural networks (CNN) and random forest (RF) model were used. CNN model outperformed the RF model and the accuracy for quantification of spores was improved by 4% and 8% in the presence and absence, respectively of dead spores. The screening system used in this study was a combination of HSI and deep learning modelling, which resulted in an overall accuracy of 90-94% when the dead/inactivated spores were present and absent, respectively. The only discrepancy detected was during the prediction of samples with low inoculum levels (<102 CFU/ml). In summary, it was evident that HSI in combination with a deep learning approach showed immense potential as a tool to detect and quantify spores on nutrient media as well as on specific food matrix (mashed potato). However, the presence of dead spores in any sample is postulated to affect the accuracy and would need replicates and confirmatory assays.

Phenolic acid bound arabinoxylans extracted from Little and Kodo millets modulate immune system mediators and pathways in RAW 264.7 cells.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					The immunomodulating effect of Phenolic acid bound arabinoxylans (PCA-AXs) extracted from Little (PCA-AX-L) and Kodo (PCA-AX-K) millet seeds in RAW 264.7 cells were investigated. The PCA-AXs were extracted from millets and their chemical characterization were carried out by GC-MS, HPLC, and FT-IR. The immunomodulatory effect of PCA-AXs in RAW 264.7 cells were investigated by estimating ROS, NO, and cytokines TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and evaluation of molecular mechanism by q-PCR & western blotting techniques. The xylose: arabinose ratio of PCA-AX-L and PCA-AX-K were 1.48:1.0 and 2.26:1.0, respectively. The phenolic acids content was higher in PCA-AX-K than PCA-AX-L determined by HPLC. FT-IR analysis confirms the presence of alpha-glucosidic linkage with the degree of substitution of xylan backbone by arabinose residues. The evaluation of immunomodulating effect of PCA-AXs revealed that the PCA-AX-L-treated cells showed higher release of NO, ROS and cytokines than PCA-AX-K-treated cells. The mRNA expressions of TNF-alpha, iNOS and COX-2 were upregulated by PCA-AX-L and downregulated by PCA-AX-K in dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in western blotting, the ERK and NF-kappaB were found to be activated by PCA-AX-L and inhibited by PCA-AX-K. Our findings suggest that the high branched arabinoxylans of PCA-AX-L could modulate the immune response in RAW 264.7 cells through activation of ERK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and acts as an immunostimulant. The higher phenolic content in PCA-AX-K could modulate the immune response by downregulation of ERK and NF-kappaB signaling pathways and thus, it could act as an immunomodulator. Practical applications: Millets are the richest source of arabinoxylans in which they are known to be bound with phenolic acids (PCA-AX). Arabinoxylans derived from rice and wheat is known immunomodulators. This study was focused to evaluate the immunomodulatory property of PCA-AX derived from two different millets little and kodo. The study results clearly indicated the immune stimulatory action of PCA-AX-L and immunomodulatory action of PCA-AX-K. The explored mechanism indicated that the PCA-AXs modulate NF-kappaB & ERK pathways for their immunomodulatory action. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13563					FSTA:2021-05-Mg2874
J		Ataei Nukabadi, F.; Mohammad Hojjatoleslamy; Hajar Abbasi							Optimization of fortified sponge cake by nettle leaves and milk thistle seed powder using mixture design approach.		Food Science & Nutrition					Powdered nettle leaf and milk thistle (MT) seed were added to the cake batter with certain percentages selected by the Design-Expert v. 10 software (0-25, 25-0, 18.75-6.25, 6.25-18.75, and 12.5-12.5). Addition of nettle and MT seeds to the cake reduced the moisture content, volume, and springiness and increased hardness of the samples. 12.5% nettle-12.5% MT seed had the least hardness and the highest amount of springiness and cohesiveness. The highest BI, WI, SI, L*, a*, and b* and the lowest Delta E were observed in 12.5% nettle-12.5% MT seed and 25% MT seed samples, respectively. Antioxidant activity and antimicrobial properties were increased in all samples compared to the control sample, so that 6.25% nettle-18.75% MT exhibited the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial properties. The highest levels of quercetin and silymarin were observed in 25% nettle and 25% MT seeds, respectively. In the sensory evaluation, 12.5% nettle-12.5% MT seed took the best scores regarding flavor, texture, color, and overall acceptance. Based on the lowest hardness, 13.65% nettle-11.34% MT seed was determined as optimized points by the software, which was equivalent to desirability of 0.72. The optimum sample contained 62.90 mg quercetin and 886.70 mg silymarin. According to the HPLC analysis results, consumption of 10 optimal cakes daily could theoretically decrease the blood sugar level, which requires further studies. The remaining amount of quercetin and silymarin in 2.5 g of nettle leaves and 2.5 g of MT seeds after heating was 11 and 19 mg, respectively. In other words, heat did not have much effect on the destruction of quercetin and silymarin. © 2020 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Atakan, O.; Caner, C.							Evaluation of different ozonation on aflatoxin degradation and physicochemical characteristics of hazelnuts.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Hazelnut contaminated with aflatoxin (5,10, 25, and 50 ppb) were treated ozone at three different doses and two exposure times (5,10, and 20 ppm for 10 and 20 min) on aflatoxin degradation. The highest peroxide value was reached (12.89 meqO2/kg) 20 ppm/20 min, and the lowest was 5 ppm/20 min (3.20 meqO2/kg). The reductions of alpha-tocopherol were 15.38%-28.87%, when control 19.14%, and the highest reduction were ozone concentration had adverse effect on alpha-tocopherol (24.96% 20 ppm/10 min), 28.87% (20 ppm/20 min). Ozonation was not lead to significant changes in color (L*, a*, and b*) and textures. Decrease in aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) contents was dependent on increasing ozone concentration, the highest degradation for AFB1 (38.96%) and total aflatoxins (31.35%) were obtained with use of 20 ppm/20 min ozonation. At 5 g/kg contaminated group, the AFB1 reduction rate was 19.88% for 5. Min and 32.23% for 20 min. Ozonation, especially 5 ppm is innovative for reducing aflatoxin, while maintaining the quality. Practical applications. The effect of different ozone treatments on the degradation of the aflatoxin (AFB1), which was produced by mold growth on hazelnuts' physicochemical characteristics, was determined. It is essential that ozonation with low concentration and short application time is needed to minimize the destruction to tocopherols and specific nutrition. The current research aimed to determine the lowest optimal dose of detoxification using different amounts of ozone and exposure time on the different amounts of AFB1.In addition, the effects of ozone applications on the physicochemical characteristics of nuts were also determined. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Journal of Food Process Engineering					Agglomeration process improves instant properties of powders and increases consumer appreciation, reduces losses during production, and facilitates the processability of these powders in the industry. Mushroom powders (MP) have been subjected to agglomeration process at different process parameters: inlet air temperature (50-80 °C), atomizing pressure (0.5-1.5 bars), and sprayed pure water amount (20-50g) and the effects of process parameters on the physical and morphological properties of MP were investigated. The inlet air temperature and pure water amount have a linear effect on moisture content, apparent density, particle size, and porosity. Emulsion stability index was affected by inlet air temperature and atomization pressure. The optimal process condition (70 °C inlet temperature 0.5 bar atomizing pressure and 50g pure water amount) was determined for minimization of moisture content, wetting time, as well as maximation of particle size, porosity, emulsifying and foaming properties, and solubility. The results suggested that improving instant and physical properties make easier the processability of these powders in the industry and increased emulsifying properties show a good opportunity for usage of agglomerated MP in the emulsion systems. Practical Applications. This study showed the effects of the agglomeration process on the physicochemical, morphological, instant, and emulsifying properties of mushroom powders. The improvement of these properties makes it possible to increase the application areas of mushroom powders as a food additive in different food formulas and emulsified products. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	6			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13687					FSTA:2021-10-Jq12915

The effects of Daucus carota extract against PC3, PNT1a prostate cells, acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S-transferase, and alpha-glycosidase; an in vitro-in silico study.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Daucus carota L. ssp. major (DCM) plant is widely used in traditional medicine to treat some types of cancer and various diseases. Therefore, we evaluated the biological activities of this plant to define its effects against prostate cancer (PCa), Alzheimer's disease (AD), oxidation, and diabetes mellitus (DM) as well as identified its phenolic composition. To determine the anti-cancer properties of the plant extract, we treated PCa cells with the extract at a concentration range of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 mg/ml. Significant results were obtained against the PC3 cells compared to normal PNT1a prostate epithelial cells. As a result of precise measurements at the millimolar level, it was observed that the plant extract showed an effective inhibition (IC50) against glutathione S-transferase (GST; 12.84 mM), acetyl cholinesterase (AChE; 15.07 mM), and alpha-Gly (11.75 mM) enzymes when compared with standard inhibitors. Antioxidant activities of DCM methanol extract were determined via two well-known in vitro techniques. The extracts showed antioxidant activities against the DPPH and ABTS+. The LC-ESI-MS/MS was used to determine the phenolic compounds of methanol extract from DCM. Chlorogenic acid (2,089.096 g/g), shikimic acid (193.14 g/g), and coumarin (113.604 g/g) were characterized as major phenolic compounds. In addition, the interactions of chlorogenic acid, chrysin, coumarin, and shikimic acid with the used three enzymes have been calculated using molecular docking simulation. Practical applications. Plant natural phenolic compounds have protective effects such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticarcinogen, and enzyme inhibitory. Therefore, it has an important place in the food and pharmaceutical industry. The present study aims to reveal the enzyme inhibitory, antioxidant, and anticarcinogenic properties of the Daucus carota ssp. Major (DCM) plant extract. Significant results were obtained against the PC3 cells compared to normal PNT1a prostate epithelial cells. DCM extract demonstrated considerable antioxidant activity and inhibitory potential on used metabolic enzymes. These biological effects are thought to have a relationship with rich chemical composition. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Atallah, A. A.; El-Deeb, A. M.; Entsar N. Mohamed							Shelf-life of Domiati cheese under modified atmosphere packaging.		Journal of Dairy Science					The present study describes the effects of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) on shelf-life extension, chemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of Domiati cheese. Five different MAP were studied [10% CO2/90% N2 (G1), 15% CO2/85% N2 (G2), 25% CO2/75% N2 (G3), 100% CO2 (G4), and 100% N2 (G5)]. Control samples were packaged in air (CA) and under vacuum. In both groups of cheeses, chemical analysis was significantly affected by MAP during cold storage. Ripening indexes were significantly affected by MAP during cold storage. Microbiological data showed that G4, followed by G5, were the most effective groups inhibiting the growth of total aerobic mesophilic and psychrotrophic bacteria, and yeasts and molds until the end of storage.

Imbabi							Physiological performance of rabbits administered buffalo milk yogurts enriched with whey protein concentrate, calcium caseinate or Spirulina platensis.		Foods					The present study examines the impacts of supplementing yogurt with 1% whey protein concentrate (WPC), Ca-caseinate (Ca-CN) and Spirulina platensis on the physiological performance of V-line rabbits receiving diets containing yogurt (at a dose of 5 g/kg body weight/day) and the different meat quality aspects. The results show that fat content was highest (p< 0.05) in yogurt fortified with Spirulina powder, but protein (%) was highest in yogurt enriched with WPC. Yogurt containing Spirulina powder showed a significant (p< 0.05) increase in total antioxidant activity. The final live body weight for G1 was higher than the other groups. However, additives affected the saddle, hind legs, liver and neck percentages significantly (p< 0.05). There were not significant differences for all groups in the forelegs, lung and heart percentages. LDL-cholesterol, total protein, globulin, albumin, creatinine and immunoglobulin M values were lowest (p< 0.05) in the WPC group. Significant improvements appeared in the small intestinal wall, microbiology, growth performance, serum biochemistry, organ histology and meat quality of the group receiving enriched yogurt. Yogurts enriched with WPC, Ca-CN and Spirulina platensis can be used as functional foods. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Atallah, S. S.; Bazzani, C.; Ha, K. A.; Nayga, R. M.							Does the origin of inputs and processing matter? Evidence from consumers' valuation for craft beer.		Food Quality and Preference					In this study we aim at exploring consumer valuation for craft beer brewed locally and made with locally grown hops. The research is motivated by the fact that, although existing literature shows that consumers generally pay a price premium for locally produced foods or those made with local ingredients, it is still unclear how consumers value localness of production (i.e., brewing location) over localness of inputs (i.e., hops origin) and whether consumers value these attributes as either complements or substitutes. Moreover, little is still known regarding consumer preference for local ingredients in beer. Thus, we address these research questions by means of a choice experiment survey on craft beer consumers in the State of Indiana, United States. Results show that consumers have the highest willingness to pay for craft beer brewed in-state, but preferences over hops origin are heterogeneous. We find evidence of complementarity between brewing and hops origins among frequent craft drinkers and evidence of substitution between these claims for casual drinkers. Segmenting consumers based on how they define local beer, we find one consumer segment that has the highest willingness to pay for beer brewed in-state and made with hops that are grown in-state. These results can inform product differentiation, marketing, and pricing strategies. They are also relevant to state policymakers supporting local hops production and local brewing.

J		Atasoy, R.; Ertop, M. H.							Assessment of nutritional and bioactive properties for gluten-free tarhana containing various legumes and cereals.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The present study investigates the use of chickpea, bean, corn, brown rice, buckwheat, and lentil flours instead of wheat flour in terms of several nutritional and bioactive properties of the tarhana. The fatty acid composition, antioxidant activity, in vitro mineral digestibility, phytic acid, and mineral contents of the flour and tarhana samples were analyzed. When the formulation and other raw material qualities were kept constant, the properties of tarhana were significantly affected by the type of flour. They influenced the fatty acid composition of tarhana samples. Linoleic acid (C18:2), oleic acid (C18:3), and palmitic acid (C16:0) were found to be the predominant fatty acids in tarhana samples. Total USFA contents of the tarhana samples were significantly (p<.05) higher than the content of saturated fatty acids SFA, especially in red lentil (USFA content 77.28%). It was determined that cereal and legume flours were good sources of minerals and USFAs. The digestible ash content of all tarhana samples increased by approximately two or three times compared to the flour sample. Practical applications. Since the lentils, chickpeas, rice, bean, buckwheat, and corn flours do not contain gluten, these new tarhana products will be a good alternative that can be consumed by celiac patients. Their high nutritional quality, due to mineral content, antioxidant activity, and fatty acid composition than the traditional wheat tarhana, will make tarhana value-added product in the view of customer perception. It is thought that the products obtained in this study will be an alternative for the search for functional, natural, and nutritional products for the consumption of current consumers. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Atay, E.; Altan, A.							Nanoencapsulation of black seed oil by coaxial electrospraying: characterisation, oxidative stability and in vitro gastrointestinal digestion.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, black seed oil-loaded zein nanoparticles were produced via coaxial electrospraying. Nanoparticles obtained under optimised conditions had a uniform morphology with a mean diameter of 136 nm and a core-shell structure verified by confocal laser scanning microscope. The encapsulation efficiency of the oil in nanoparticles ranged from 65.3 to 97.2%. The peroxide value of oil in nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency was approximately three times lower than unencapsulated oil when stored at 60 °C for 55 days. The totox value of the encapsulated oil in nanoparticles stored at 25 °C was lower than the critical totox value of 30. The amount of thymoquinone released from encapsulated oil was low at the end of the gastric digestion, but the bioaccessibility of thymoquinone from encapsulated oil increased during intestinal digestion compared with free oil. These results demonstrated the successful nanoencapsulation of black seed oil with the improved oxidative stability due to the coaxial structures formed. Black seed oil-loaded zein particles may have the potential to expand the use of black seed oil as a functional ingredient for food systems. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Atefeh Abedi; Leila Lakzadeh; Mehdi Amouheydari							Effect of an edible coating composed of whey protein concentrate and rosemary essential oil on the shelf life of fresh spinach.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Coating fresh vegetables is a useful strategy to maintain quality and prevent food waste. In this study, the effect of an edible coating composed of whey protein concentrate (WPC) and rosemary essential oil (REO) was evaluated on extending the shelf life of fresh spinach. The REO coating in 0.6% concentration decreased total microbial and coliform counts to 0.57, 0.23 log CFU/g, respectively, during storage. The coated sample with REO had the lowest decrease in the chlorophyll content on most days of the storage. The pH content compared to the control in samples of REO did not decrease significantly. WPC treatment demonstrated a preventive effect on weight loss and reduced the transmission of oxygen. According to the test panel, the spinach coating with 0.3% REO and WPC had the highest score. So, this coating can be considered a potentially effective method to increase the shelf life and quality of spinach. Practical applications. Antimicrobial food coatings are protective barriers that, other than biodegradability, have the benefits of postponing spoilage, preserving the appearance of food, protecting foods against moisture loss, and preventing the transmission of oxygen, thus promoting the maintenance of nutritional quality and improving food safety. The current research has designed an edible coating made from whey protein concentrate and rosemary essential oil coatings and evaluated biochemical, physicochemical, mechanical, and sensory properties of these coatings on spinach to extend the shelf life. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15284					FSTA:2021-08-Jq10411
J		Atefeh Babaei; Reza Asadpour; Kamran Mansouri; Adel Sabrivand; Siamak Kazemi-darabadi							Lycopene protects sperm from oxidative stress in the experimental varicocele model.		Food Science & Nutrition					Oxidative stress (OS) is an important parameter in the evaluation of infertility caused by varicocele. Antioxidants are the most commonly prescribed drugs in these patients. Lycopene molecule, as the powerful antioxidant in the carotenoid family, has beneficial effects on improving fertility in males. Therefore, we investigated the effects of lycopene on induced OS by varicocele in an animal model. Forty-five adult male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (n=12) and varicocele (n=33). Two months after induced varicocele, five rats in each group were sacrificed randomly and induced varicocele was investigated. Remained rats were divided into five groups (n=7), including the control (I), varicocele (II), varicocele reserving solvent (III), varicocele reserving lycopene 4 mg/kg (IV), and 10 mg/kg (V) for two months. At the end of the experiment, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), %DNA damage, and antioxidant enzymatic levels were measured. The results indicated that there were significant increases in the levels of ROS, MDA, DNA damage, superoxide dismutase (SOD), sperm concentration, and motility in the varicocele groups compared with the control group. In the lycopene group (10 mg/kg), sperm concentration, the levels of TAC, and catalase (CAT) activity were improved so the levels of ROS, MDA, and%DNA damage were reduced compared with varicocele group. Our findings indicated that the administration of lycopene especially at a dose of 10 mg/kg in the varicocele group could protect sperm from OS and sperm DNA damage by increasing antioxidant activity and reducing ROS. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Atefeh Tavakoli; Atieh Mirzababaei; Khadijeh Mirzaei							Association between low carbohydrate diet (LCD) and sleep quality by mediating role of inflammatory factors in women with overweight and obesity: a cross-sectional study.		Food Science & Nutrition					Poor sleep quality can lead to increased obesity. Low carbohydrate diet (LCD) is considered as an approach for sleep quality and obesity improvement. The aim of this investigation is to evaluate the relationship between LCD and sleep quality with the mediatory effect of inflammatory markers including transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total antioxidant capacity: In our cross-sectional study, 304 obese women aged from 19 to 50 years were enrolled. Body mass index (BMI) in these women ranged from 25.2 to 48.3kg/m2. LCD score was assessed by a 147-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to assess the sleep quality. FFQ and PSQI questionnaires are completed simultaneously by the participants. Biochemical indicators (inflammatory markers) were measured and anthropometric components were evaluated. The relationship between sleep quality and LCD with quantitative variables was assessed by independent sample t-test and with qualitative variables by chi-square test. Binary logistic regression was used to estimate confounding variables including age, job, stress, weight to investigate the relationship between LCD and sleep. Following of LCD had a significant negative relationship with PSQI score. It can be said that with increasing LCD adherence, the possibility of poor sleep quality decrease (OR = 0.43, 95% CI = 0.19-0.94, p = .03). It was also showed, hs-CRP (OR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.3-1.21, p = .16) and TAC (OR = 0.6, 95% CI = 0.25-1.4, p = 0.24), eliminated the significance of the association and it is possible that they play a mediating role in this relationship Following the LCD can have a positive effect on improving PSQI scores by reduction in inflammatory markers levels. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Atefeh Zamani-Ghalehshahi; Parisa Farzaneh							Effect of hydrocolloid coatings (Basil seed gum, xanthan, and methyl cellulose) on the mass transfer kinetics and quality of fried potato strips.		Journal of Food Science					In this research, the effect of different temperatures (160, 180, and 190 °C) and hydrocolloid coatings (Basil seed gum [BSG], xanthan gum [XG], methylcellulose [MC], BSG-XG, and BSG-MC mixtures) were investigated on the physicochemical properties (oil uptake, moisture loss, color, microscopic structure, activation energy, and texture), mass transfer kinetic of fried potato strips in deep-fat frying, and oil partitions using frying and postfrying cooling phase. An increase in frying time reduced the moisture content and hardness of potato strips; however, the oil content and color difference increased. The oil content in the coated samples had lower rates than that in the noncoated ones. The treated samples using BSG-xanthan mixture (50: 50) and BSG had the lowest oil uptake at 0.13% and 0.14% Dry basis (d.b.), respectively. The maximum and minimum values of effective moisture diffusivity were measured in control and samples coated with BSG-XG and BSG, respectively. As frying temperature increased, the specific rate of oil uptake increased and the equilibrium oil content decreased. Overall, BSG-XG mixture-coated potato strips can be used as a promising product due to absorbing the lowest oil rate and being similar to the control in terms of organoleptic properties. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	4	1215	1227	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15655					FSTA:2021-08-Jl10709

Effects of the dietary approach to stop hypertension (DASH) diet on blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid profile in adolescents with hemophilia: a randomized clinical trial.		Food Science & Nutrition					Children with hemophilia are an enhanced risk of modifiable cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities. There is currently no nutritional guideline to prevent or manage cardiometabolic risk factors in these patients. Therefore, the present study sought to investigate the effect of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet on cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors among children with hemophilia. In this parallel randomized clinical trial, 40 children (all male) with hemophilia were randomly allocated to the DASH group (n=20) or control group (n=20) for 10 weeks. The intervention group received the DASH diet (50%-55% of energy from carbohydrate, 27%-30% of energy from fat and 16%-18% energy from protein), and the control group received nutritional recommendations based on healthy eating practices. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting blood sugar (FBS), triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Serum vitamin C was measured as a biomarker of compliance with the DASH diet. Study was registered at IRCT. Ir (IRCT20130903014551N6). A significant increase in serum vitamin C in the DASH diet group was observed compared to the control group (p =.001), indicating good compliance with the DASH diet. There was a significant reduction in SBP (-0.48 mmHg), DBP (-0.48 mmHg), FBS (-5.86 mg/dl), TC (-16.07 mg/dl), TG (-17.21 mg/dl), and LDL-C (-9.79 mg/dl), and a significant increase in HDL-C (3.39 mg/dl), in the DASH diet group compared with the control group. Adherence to the DASH diet in children with hemophilia yielded beneficial effects in blood pressure, lipid profiles, and FBS. © 2020 The Authors.

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					In the context of side-stream valorization, this study aimed to gain insight into the functionalization of industrially-generated pumpkin pomace as texturizing ingredient. Given the matrix complexity of pumpkin pomace, composed of crushed peels, seeds and mesocarp, this study focused on the impact of different sample preparation, as well as mechanical processing, on the microstructural and rheological properties of pumpkin pomace suspensions. Pumpkin pomace suspensions (4% w/w) possessed a solid-like behavior, demonstrating the potential for structure build-up. The application of heat during sample preparation (85°C, 30 min) significantly increased the storage modulus of the pumpkin pomace-derived suspensions, which was found to be related to an increased swelling volume of the suspended particles. Moreover, a combination of partial pectin removal and high pressure homogenization at 80 MPa led to improved network structure formation, as obvious from an increased storage modulus. These results are highly useful as scientific basis for exploring the texturizing potential of pumpkin pomace with minimal processing or conventional preparation methods (e.g. by heat treatment).

J		Ates, C.; Evrendilek, G. A.; Uzuner, S.							High-pressure processing of shalgam with respect to quality characteristics, microbial inactivation, and shelflife extension.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					High hydrostatic pressure (HHP) processing of traditional fermented turnip juice (shalgam) was studied with respect to quality attributes, microbial inactivation, and shelflife extension. According to Box-Behnken design, shalgam samples were processed using 3-15 min, 4-40 °C, and 200-500 MPa. The optimum processing conditions involved 34.23°C, 15 min, and 500 MPa for the color intensity and tone of 3.43 and 0.69 and the numbers of viable total mold and yeast, Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, and Lactobacillus paracasei of 3.09, 2.51, and 2.68 log cfu/ml, respectively. Shalgam samples processed under the optimum conditions were stored at 4 and 22°C for 90 days. The control samples at 4 and 22 °C were spoiled at 60 and 45th days, respectively. The storage time rather than the HHP processing affected physical properties, organic acids, phenolic compounds, and anthocyanins of shalgam. The treatment samples had significantly lower microbial growth during the storage time. Practical applications. Due to the deteriorated color, bioactive, and sensory properties, the traditional heat processing of shalgam with the addition of antimicrobial agents (such as sodium benzoate) to extend its shelflife is not desirable by consumers. Alternative processing technologies are needed to extend its shelflife with no significant changes in its important properties. Its HHP treatment appeared as a practical option that preserved its quality parameters and extended its shelflife. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.			akdemir evrendilek, gulsun/0000-0001-5064-4195							2021	45	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15598					FSTA:2021-11-Jq14685
J		Ates, E. G.; Ozvural, E. B.; Oztop, M. H.							In vitro digestibility of rare sugar (D-allulose) added pectin-soy protein gels.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Confectionery gels are known to be high-caloric products due their high sugar content. Changing their formulations by substituting the sugar with alternative natural sweeteners and functionalising them, the addition of proteins has gained attention. Understanding the rate of digestion of these products is also important for selecting the appropriate formulation. In this study, in vitro gastric digestion behaviour of the gels formulated with D-allulose, a low-calorie rare sugar, soy protein isolate (SPI) (1%, 2.5%) and pectin (4%) were examined. Digestion decreased the hardness of the gels (P< 0.05), but, at 2.5% SPI concentration. Moisture content of the samples increased after digestion and presence of SPI induced higher water uptake. At the end of 2 h of digestion, 1% soy protein isolate containing gels had the highest brix values showing that after a certain concentration, soy protein isolate governed the system due to improved soy protein-pectin interaction or due to improved gelation with Maillard reaction. NMR relaxometry experiments further confirmed the changes in the gels with the increase in T2 values. Power law model was fitted for the dissolution behaviour using theoBrix values of the digestion medium. Dissolution of sugar and the contribution of SPI to the gel network were clearly observed in SEM images. Results showed that these gels had the potential to slow down the emptying rate of stomach thus could lead to "fullness" for a longer time. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3421	3431	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14966					FSTA:2021-10-Lj1670
J		Ates, E. G.; Beira, M. J.; Oztop, M. H.; Sebastiao, P. J.							Characterization of pectin-based gels: a 1H nuclear magnetic resonance relaxometry study.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Rare sugars are monosaccharides and their derivatives that are not commonly found in nature. D-allulose is a rare sugar that is C-3 epimer of fructose and presents an alternative to sucrose with potential health benefits. In this study, different amounts of sucrose, D-allulose, and soy protein isolate (SPI) were used to prepare a set of pectin gels. The effect of these ingredients on the gels was studied at both a molecular level, by1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxometry, and a macroscopic level, through the assessment of viscoelastic properties as well as hardness and moisture content measurements. The NMR dispersion profiles were analyzed considering relaxation mechanisms associated with rotational and translational diffusion motions of mono-and disaccharides as well as bound water molecules. Significant variations of the local diffusion coefficient for the studied formulations were evidenced by the model fitting analysis. The viscosity trends observed within each group of samples having the same amount of SPI were mostly in agreement with the diffusion coefficients obtained from the NMR relaxometry. The observed discrepancies could be explained considering hardness and moisture content results, which put into evidence the fact that decreasing the moisture (mainly free water) affects the macroscopic properties of the systems, such as hardness and viscosity, but not the local diffusion processes probed by NMR relaxometry. These findings show the importance of combining both micro-and macroscopic information to analyze the different properties of food products.

The resulting extracts were evaluated against reference extracts obtained without PEF. For estimation of the extraction efficiency, the content in total polyphenols, individual polyphenols, and volatile compounds, as well as the resistance to oxidation, were determined. The optimal PEF contribution on the total and individual polyphenols, rosmarinic acid, extractability (up to 73.2% and 403.1% increase, respectively) was obtained by 25% v/v aqueous ethanol solvent using a pulse duration of 100 mus.

Food Bioscience					In this study, an environment-friendly pH-responsive indicator was prepared from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose/microcrystalline cellulose biocomposites (HMB) and butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea) anthocyanin (BA). BA at concentrations of 10, 15, and 20 mg was incorporated into the HMB matrix. Physical and chemical properties, including NH3 sensitivity, of the fabricated indicators were analyzed. Results indicate that incorporation of 10 and 15 mg of BA improved the microstructure, tensile strength, transparency, and thermal stability of HMB. However, the HMB indicator with 15 mg of BA (1.5BA-HMB) exhibited better NH3 sensitivity than that of the HMB indicator with 10 mg of BA. Therefore, 15 mg was selected as the optimum concentration of BA for indicator fabrication. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator was used to monitor the freshness of mackerel (Scomber scombrus) by attaching it to inside of the package exposed to the headspace. The 1.5BA-HMB indicator clearly changed color with respect to variation in the quality of S. scombrus during storage at 4 °C. Based on the changes in the color of 1.5BA-HMB, the quality of S. scombrus was interpreted as follows: deep purple and light purple colors indicated that S. scombrus was fresh, violet color indicated that S. scombrus was suitable for eating, and blue, green ocean, and colonial blue colors indicated spoilage of S. scombrus. Thus, the 1.5BA-HMB indicator can be used as a sustainable pH-responsive indicator for intelligent food packaging.

J		Athip Boonsiriwit; Myungho Lee; Minhwi Kim; Pontree Itkor; Youn Suk Lee							Exogenous melatonin reduces lignification and retains quality of green asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.).		Foods					Asparagus (Asparagus officinalis L.) is highly perishable because of its high respiration rate, which continues after harvesting and leads to weight loss, increased hardness, color change, and limited shelf life. Melatonin is an indoleamine that plays an important role in abiotic stress. This study was designed to investigate the effects of melatonin on the quality attributes of green asparagus during cold storage. Green asparagus was soaked in a melatonin solution (50, 100, and 200 muM) for 30 min and then stored at 4°C under 90% relative humidity for 25 days. The results indicated that melatonin treatment delayed the post-harvest senescence of asparagus and maintained high chlorophyll and vitamin C levels. Melatonin treatment hindered phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and peroxidase activities and reduced lignin content, thereby delaying the increase in firmness. Moreover, melatonin treatment enhanced catalase and superoxide dismutase activities, leading to reduced hydrogen peroxide content. These results indicate that melatonin treatment can be used to maintain the post-harvest quality and prolong the shelf life of green asparagus. © 2021 by the authors.

Preparation and characterization of iron-chelating peptides from whey protein: an alternative approach for chemical iron fortification.		Food Research International					Iron fortification of staple food is a strategy utilized worldwide to address the concern of dietary iron deficiency. However, traditional salt-based fortification methods have limitations with gastrointestinal stability and bioavailability. Iron chelating peptides from easily available and scalable proteins such as whey protein have been proposed as promising candidates to circumvent the above mentioned limitations by enhancing iron absorption and bioavailability. In this study, we report methods to produce whey protein derived iron-chelating peptides and describe their physicochemical characteristics. Peptides derived from whey proteins prepared by ultrafiltration of whey followed by hydrolysation were iron chelated to produce peptide-iron complexes. These complexes had a size of 422.93.41 nm, chelated iron content of 36.42 g/ mg protein, and a low zeta potential (-10.80 mV) compared to whey peptides. Spectra analysis using ultraviolet-visible absorption and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed structural transformation indicating iron chelation. Mass spectrometric analysis using LC-MS/MS confirmed the presence of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic peptides in the complexes with sizes ranging from 275 Da to 1916 Da. Furthermore, reduction in the antioxidant property of peptides following iron complexing indicates iron chelation. Our results suggest that whey protein derived peptide-iron complexes can be used as a potential alternative for chemical iron fortificants for food products and also as iron supplements.

J		Atia Gohar; Nida Dastagir; Almas Jabeen; Kamran Azim, M.							Characterization of immunomodulatory activity of proteins of natural honeys.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The protein constituent of honey exhibits therapeutic activities in inflammation, and parasitic infections. The biological activities of honey depend on multiple factors such as types of flora, honeybee species, and geographical region. The immunomodulatory activities of proteins of honey of many floral types have not been performed so far. In this study, the proteins composition in seven types of honeys of different flora (Acacia, Thyme, Pine, Khairpur, Chinaberry, Gum tree and Citrus honeys), and geographical regions was determined using gel filtration chromatography (GFC), and their anti-inflammatory activity was studied by determining the inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in zymogen activated human polymorph nuclear leucocytes (PMNLs). The analysis showed that natural honeys differ in their proteins composition, containing 3-6 proteins fractions. The concentration dependent inhibition of ROS production was observed with precipitated as well as fractionated honey proteins (IC50 0.6-18 ng/mL). The crude proteins of acacia honey exhibited IC50 of 11.3 ng/mL, thyme 5.3 ng/mL, pine 3.1 ng/mL, Khairpur 7.5 ng/mL, and Chinaberry 16.5 ng/mL. Different GFC fractions of honey samples under study also showed significantly low IC50 values in the range of 0.2-9.8 ng/mL. The results of this study show, for the first time, that protein fractions of natural honeys of different botanical flora possess varying yet high potential to suppress ROS production in macrophages, suggesting their tissue protective role by alleviating oxidative stress. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4475	4481	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01033-2					FSTA:2022-01-Lg0099
J		Atici, A. A.; Sepil, A.; Sen, F.							High levels of microplastic ingestion by commercial, planktivorous Alburnus tarichi in Lake Van, Turkey.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Microplastic pollution of inland environments has been receiving increased publicity over the last few years. For the first time, this study reports on the presence of microplastics (0.1 mm to <5 mm) in the gastrointestinal tracts of Alburnus tarichi in Lake Van from January to April 2020. In total, 101 fishes were obtained from Citoren, Edremit, Gevas and Dagonu fisheries regions. A total of 3338 pieces of plastic, ranging from 8 to 124 samples per fish with averaging 34 13 MPs/individual, were extracted from gastrointestinal tracts of fish. The majority of the ingested particles consisted of fibres (74%), and blue coloured material was the most consumed microplastic. The polymers identified by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) were polyethylene and polypropylene. Consequently, this study suggested that the vast majority of A. tarichi were contaminated with microplastics and showed higher abundance in comparison with other worldwide studies so far. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

J		Atieh Ghalkhani; Shirin Moradkhani; Meysam Soleimani; Dara Dastan							Functional components, antibacterial, antioxidant, and cytotoxic activities of Lamium garganicum L. ssp. pictum as a novel natural agents from lamiaceae family.		Food Bioscience					Lamium garganicum L. ssp. pictum is one of the edible species of Lamiaceae family found in the Iran. This study aims to determine the phytochemical profile; antibacterial, cytotoxic, and antioxidant activities of this plant. The essential oil constituents were analyzed using GC-MS/FID, and a total of 55 components were identified. The major components were trans-phytol acetate, trans-beta farnesene, and trans-caryophyllene. The evaluation of antibacterial activity showed that the essential oil had the greatest antibacterial effect against Bacillus cereus. Furthermore, based on the DPPH assay, the hydroalcoholic extract exhibited the most potent scavenging activity. The hydroalcoholic extract was the richest in phenolic compounds (3.94 mg gallic acid/g sample). The RP-HPLC-PDA analysis of extract showed the presence of caffeic acid, benzoic acid, ferulic acid, catechin, and rutin (3.39, 2.67, 0.72, 0.69 and 0.57 mg/100 g of the plant, respectively). The cytotoxic activity of the extracts against the human breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 was assessed by the standard MTT assay, using HEK293 cell lines as control. The ethyl acetate extract exhibited the lowest IC50 value (101.35 mug/ml). The results indicate that the L. garganicum ssp. pictum is a rich source of natural compounds with biological activities that can be useful in food industries.

J		Atik, A.; Gumus, T.							The effect of different doses of UV-C treatment on microbiological quality of bovine milk.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, a non-thermal technology for preservation with the use of UV-C (ultraviolet) was examined in bovine milk. After UV-C treatment, the counts of microorganisms naturally found in raw milk and counts in pathogen-inoculated UHT milk were determined. For UV-C treatment, a reactor with a variable flow rate (5 mL/min to 18 mL/min) and temperature range (4°-25°) was designed and the data were modeled using response surface methodology. After UV-C treatment, approximately 2 log decrease in total mesophilic aerobic bacteria count and approximately 4 log decrease in yeast-mold count were achieved in raw milk. For pathogen-inoculated UHT milk, Salmonella Typhimurium (ATCC 14028), Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC 19115), Staphylococcus aureus (ATTC 25923) and Escherichia coli (ATTC 35218) counts were decreased by nearly 2 log, 2.5 log, 2.5 log and 3 log CFU, respectively. Since high-dose UV-C treatment is detrimental to the sensory properties of milk, it can be integrated with existing pasteurization techniques with a reduction in pasteurization temperature rather than as a stand alone alternative to pasteurization of raw milk.

J		Atik, D. S.; Gurbuz, B.; Boluk, E.; Palabiyik, I.							Development of vegan kefir fortified with Spirulina platensis.		Food Bioscience					The choices for dairy products have increased in recent years because of medical recommendations or lifestyle preferences. This study was set out to assess the importance of Spirulina platensis fortification in vegan kefir production at the ratio of 0.25% and 0.50%. The most notable plant-based milk substitutes, soy milk and almond milk, were used to produce kefir. Titratable acidity, pH, water holding capacity, and microbiological counts were measured in kefir samples for 21 days. Additionally, color, antioxidant activity, total phenolic content analysis, and rheological properties were evaluated. Increasing Spirulina platensis concentration increased the counts of lactobacilli and lactococci and the total phenolic content of kefir, whereas pH values of kefir samples decreased. An increase in the Spirulina platensis amount was correlated with lower L*, a*, and b* values than control samples. According to the results, Spirulina platensis can be considered as a promising functional food component to improve the prebiotic potential and bioactive quality of foods.

J		Atik, I.; Cakmak, Z. H. T.; Avci, E.; Karasu, S.							The effect of cold press chia seed oil by-products on the rheological, microstructural, thermal, and sensory properties of low-fat ice cream.		Foods					This study aimed to investigate the utilization of cold-pressed chia-seed oil by-products (CSOB) in a low-fat ice cream formulation as a fat replacer and stabilizer. In the study, ice cream emulsion mixtures were formulated by using 0.2-0.4% xanthan gum (XG), 2.5-12.5% fat, and 1-3% CSOB. Optimization was performed using the response surface methodology (RSM) and full factorial central composite design (CCD) based on the flow behavior rheological properties of the emulsions obtained from 17 different experimental points. All of the emulsion samples showed non-Newtonian shear-thinning flow behavior. The consistency coefficient (Kappa) values of the emulsion samples were found to be 4.01-26.05 Pasn and were significantly affected by optimization parameters (p< 0.05). The optimum formulation was determined as 0.29% XG, 2.5% CSOB, 2.5% fat. The low-fat (LF-IC) and full-fat control samples (FF-IC) were compared to samples produced with an optimum formulation (CBLF-IC) based on the steady shear, frequency sweep, and 3-ITT (three interval thixotropy test) rheological properties, thermal properties, emulsion stability, light microscope images, and sensory quality. CBLF-IC showed similar rheological behavior to FF-IC. The mix of CBLF-IC showed higher emulsion stability and lower poly-dispersity index (PDI) value and fat globule diameters than those of FF-IC and LF-IC. The thermal properties of the samples were significantly affected by the addition of CSOB in an ice cream mix. CBLF-IC exhibited a lower temperature range (DeltaT), enthalpy of fusion (DeltaHf), and freezing point temperature (Tf) than those of FF-IC and LF-IC. While CBLF-IC exhibited a higher overrun value than other samples, it showed similar sensory properties to the FF-IC sample. The results of this study suggested that CSOB could be used successfully in low-fat ice cream production. This study also has the potential to gain new perspectives for the evaluation of CSOB as a fat substitute in a low-fat ice cream. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Physicochemical, functional and structural characteristics of grains, flour and protein isolates of Indian quinoa lines.		Food Research International					The physicochemical and functional properties of grains, flour and protein isolates (QPI) from different quinoa lines were evaluated. Quinoa flour and protein isolates were characterised by high protein (14.1-15.4% and 78.7-86%, respectively) and phenolic content (419 to 655 mg GAE/100 g). Water and oil absorption capacity of QPI (2.0-3.6 g/g and 2.71-3.32 g/g, respectively) was significantly higher than quinoa flour (1.22 and 2.17 gand 0.9 and1.54 g, respectively). QPI showed desirable functional properties in terms of high foaming capacity (50.8 to 60.2%), foam stability (38.5 to 50.4%), protein solubility (30 and 53.3%), and emulsification index (EAI-19.2-26.1 m2/g and ESI-96.7-149.8 min, respectively). Digestibility of QPI ranged between 70.8 and 77.8% and was negatively correlated to random coils. Quinoa lines with higher grain density (GD) showed higher total phenol content (TPC) and WAC and lower FRSA and OAC. QPI with higher proportions of beta-structure and random coils had enhanced protein surface activities leading to improved emulsification and foaming capabilities. Among the highly conserved polypeptides (PPs), variations were observed in accumulation of 53,59 and 32 kDa PPs for grains and 33 and 21-24 kDa PPs for QPI.

J		Atiqual Islam, M.; Beom-Gyun Jeong; Kerr, W. L.; Jiyeon Chun							Validation of phytosterol analysis by alkaline hydrolysis and trimethylsilyl derivatization coupled with gas chromatography for rice products.		Journal of Cereal Science					In this study, the alkaline hydrolysis and trimethylsilyl derivatization method coupled with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection was validated for phytosterol analysis and then applied for determination of major phytosterols (beta-sitosterol, campesterol, and stigmasterol) in rice products highly consumed in Asian countries. Recoveries of three phytosterols from brown rice, rice bran oil and standard reference material-3251 were 87.6-104.4%, 87.7-107.6%, and 92.6-99.1%, respectively, showing good accuracy of analysis. Excellent precision of phytosterol analysis was achieved from repeatability (RSD <4%), reproducibility (RSD <8%) and HorRat ratio (0.3≤HorRatr/HorRatR≤1.0). Limit of quantitation of phytosterol analysis was 0.08-0.09 mg/100 g, showing high sensitivity of analysis. The total phytosterol contents (sum of major phytosterols) of rice products ranged from 18.88 to 1375.47 mg/100 g, which was high in the order of rice bran oil, rice germ, brown rice, rice with large germ, white rice and puffed rice. beta-Sitosterol was the most predominant phytosterol in all rice products, which composed about 58.4-63.6% of the total phytosterols. White rice showed much lower phytosterol levels than brown rice and rice bran oil. However, it could be a good source of phytosterols because of the quantity daily consumed.

Immobilization of alpha-amylase enzyme on a protein @metal-organic framework nanocomposite: a new strategy to develop the reusability and stability of the enzyme.		Food Chemistry					Metal-organic structures (MOFs) have been designed for a wide range of applications due to their high porosity, large surface area, and flexibility. For the first time in this work, the successful immobilization of alpha-amylase is confirmed by the use of ZIF-8 as easy and good support. The morphology, functional groups, and chemical composition of the support and immobilized alpha-amylase were tested using different methods such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA). The enzymatic activities of the immobilized olibanum-bovine serum albumin@zeolitic imidazolate frameworks nanocomposite (OLB/BSA@ZIF-8)-alpha-amylase were compared with the free one. The pH and thermal stability of the OLB/BSA@ZIF-8-alpha-amylase were significantly enhanced compared to the free enzyme. The OLB/BSA@ZIF-8-alpha-amylase displayed excellent long-term storage stability, which could protect more than 90% of the initial activity for 8 weeks. Besides, the OLB/BSA@ZIF-8-alpha-amylase had high reusability, which showed a high degree of activity (more than 81%) after 20 cycles. This is the first study that uses OLB/BSA@ZIF-8 nanocomposite as immobilizing support for the immobilization of alpha-amylase. Improved catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km) values, reusability, and storage stability of immobilized alpha-amylase can make it suitable in industrial and biotechnological applications.

J		Atlabachew, T.; Mamo, J.							Microbiological quality of meat and swabs from contact surface in butcher shops in Debre Berhan, Ethiopia.		Journal of Food Quality					Food-borne pathogens are the primary source of infection in developing countries. The widespread practice of raw beef consumption was a potential cause of food-borne diseases in Ethiopia. Hence, this study was initiated to assess the microbiological quality of fresh meat samples from butcher shops in Debre Berhan. Fresh meat samples and swab samples from contact surfaces were collected from butcher shops for microbial analysis, following standard methods. The study revealed that the mean microbial counts of morning samples for total aerobic mesophilic, Staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliform, fecal coliform, aerobic spore formers, and yeasts and molds of the butcher shops were 5.31, 4.24, 4.47, 4.79, 4.74, 3.77, and 5.0 log cfu/g, respectively. The mean microbial counts from the afternoon sample for total aerobic mesophilic, Staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliform, fecal coliform, aerobic spore formers, and yeasts and molds of the butcher shops were 5.47, 4.78, 4.84, 4.88, 4.94, 5.15, and 5.07 log cfu/g, respectively. A higher microbial load was found from the meat sample collected in the afternoon. The mean microbial counts of total aerobic mesophilic, Staphylococci, Enterobacteriaceae, total coliform, fecal coliform, aerobic spore formers, and yeasts and molds from swabs of the contact surface were 4.17, 3.98, 4.08, 3.96, 3.86, 3.80, and 3.92 log cfu/cm2, respectively. Further characterization of the aerobic mesophilic flora indicated a dominance by Enterobacteriaceae (36%) followed by Staphylococci spp. (24%) and Bacillusspp. (19%). The prevalence of S. aureus, E. coli, and Salmonella in meat and swab samples was 37.5%, 32.5%, and 7.5%, respectively. In this study, it was observed that all samples collected from butcher shops detected a significant count of spoilage microbes. Hence, adequate sanitary measures should be taken from production to consumption stages.

Valorization of Pinus halepensis Mill. seed oil: physicochemical characteristics, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity as affected by location and extraction method.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In this study, physicochemical characteristics, phytochemical compositions, and antioxidant activities of Pinus halepensis Mill. Seed oils (PHSO) from two geographical origins (Algeria and Turkey) and obtained through two different extraction processes (cold pressing and solvent extraction) were determined. PHSO were majorly consisted of linoleic and oleic acids. Cold pressing yielded oils with lower peroxide and totox values, higher tocopherols contents (309.42-318.04 mg/100 g), higher DPPH-radical scavenging activities (25.33-26.94 mM TE/kg), and reducing capacity values (301.30-329.94 mg GAE/kg). The solvent-extracted oils contained more phytosterols (5,683.25-5,964.20 mg/kg), particularly beta-sitosterol and campesterol. Phenolic compounds of PHSO were identified by HPLC-DAD for the first time in this study. More phenolic compounds were detected in solvent-extracted oils. Turkish PHSO were richer in individual phenolics (18,928.92 mug/100 g) than the Algerian variety (2,821.01 mug/100 g). Different extraction techniques and geographical origins led to differences in physicochemical and phytochemical attributes of PHSO. Novelty impact statement. This study revealed that extraction technique (cold-pressing, solvent extraction) and geographical seed origin (Algeria, Turkey) influenced the Pinus halepensis Mill. Seed oils (PHSO) composition. PHSO are rich in fatty acids, sterols, and tocopherols majorly linoleic acid, gamma-tocopherol, and beta-sitosterol which were detected for first time for the cold pressed oils. This is the first report on phenolics compounds of these oils, mainly luteolin. The high oxidative stability and good antioxidant activities of PHSO promote their exploitation in food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals uses. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Atousa Kokabian; Daraei Garmakhany, A.; Shima Jafarzadeh; Narjes Aghajani							Incorporation of omega-3 fatty acid-rich grape seed oil in yoghurt: response surface optimization of physicochemical, textural, and sensory attributes during refrigerated storage.		Food Science & Nutrition					The demand for consuming low-fat or nonfat dairy products, especially fat-free yoghurt, has increased considerably because of the effects of high-fat diet on human health during the two past decades. Generally, consumers prefer low-fat products to the same high-fat products. For this reason, manufacturers are looking for an ideal source for replacing fat substitute. In this research, the effect of grape seed oil (GSO) as a fat replacement on different quality attributes of the produced set yoghurt was determined. The effect of diverse ratios (3:0, 1.5:1.5, and 0.5:3%) of milk fat and GSO on the change in the quality attributes of the set yoghurt for up to 22 days of refrigeration period (41 °C) was investigated. Statistical analysis revealed that increase in GSO concentration leads to a significant increase (p<.05) in viscosity, acidity, and water-holding capacity (WHC), whereas syneresis and pH value decreased during the storage time. Furthermore, increasing the proportion of fat replacement to 3% (w/w) in set yoghurt increased the samples hardness while in case of cohesiveness; negative effect was observed because of the action of fat globules within the protein system. Result of fatty acid analysis revealed that the yoghurt samples containing GSO have higher unsaturated fatty acid content than the control yoghurt sample. In conclusion, the best fat replacement concentration of GSO in producing low-fat yoghurt was found in 1.5%, which also had the highest overall acceptance score between different yoghurt samples containing different levels of GSO. © 2020 The Authors.

Genotype by climate zone interactions for fertility, somatic cell score, and production in Iranian Holsteins.		Journal of Dairy Science					The objective of this study was to investigate genetic variation and genotype by environment (G * E) interactions for fertility (including age at first calving and calving interval), somatic cell score (SCS), and milk production traits for Iranian Holsteins. Different environments were defined based on the climatic zones (cold, semi-cold, and moderate) and considering the herd location. Data were collected between 2003 and 2018 by the National Animal Breeding Center of Iran (Karaj). Variance and covariance components and genetic correlations were estimated using 2 different models, which were analyzed using Bayesian methods. For both models, performance of traits in each climate were considered as different traits. Fertility traits were analyzed using a trivariate model. Furthermore, SCS and production traits were analyzed using trivariate random regression models (records in different climate zones considered as different traits). For the fertility traits, the largest estimates of heritability were observed in cold climate. Fertility performance was always better in cold environment. Genetic correlations between climatic zones ranged from 0.85 to 0.94. For daily measurements of SCS and production traits, heritability ranged from 0.031 to 0.037 and 0.069 to 0.209, respectively. Genetic variances were the highest in the semi-cold and moderate climates for the SCS and production traits, respectively. Furthermore, across the studied climates, 305-d genetic correlation ranged from 0.756 to 0.884 for SCS and from 0.925 to 0.957 for the production traits. The structure of genetic correlation within each climate indicated a negative correlation between early and late lactation for SCS, especially in the cold climate and for milk production in the moderate climate. For fat percentage, in all climatic zones, the lowest genetic correlations were observed between early and mid-lactation. In addition, for protein production in the cold climate, a negative correlation was observed between early and late lactation. Results indicated heterogeneous variance components for all the studied traits across various climatic zones. Estimated genetic correlations for SCS revealed that the genetic expression of animals may vary by climatic zone. Results indicated the existence of G * E interaction due to the climatic condition, only for SCS. Therefore, in Iranian Holsteins, the effect of G * E interactions should not be neglected, especially for SCS, as different sires might be optimal for use in different climatic zones.

J		Atsushi, O.; Ikumi, K.; Kyoko, T.							Establishment of a cultivation method for leaf lettuce (Lactuca sativa var. crispa) and komatsuna (Brassica rapa var. perviridis) with high zinc content for patients with zinc deficiency and evaluation of its effectiveness.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Insufficient intake of zinc is associated with various diseases worldwide. To overcome this problem, we aimed to establish a method for cultivating leafy vegetables with high zinc content in hydroponics without inhibiting their growth. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the cultivated leafy vegetables with high zinc content in zinc-deficient mice. Results. By adjusting the zinc concentration in the hydroponic solution to 5 mgL-1 starting from 7days before harvesting, the zinc content in leaf lettuce increased eight times of that in the control, without any inhibition of the growth. Furthermore, when oxidized glutathione (GSSG) was added simultaneously with zinc to the hydroponic solution, the zinc content further doubled (16 times of that in the control). Similar results were obtained with komatsuna and red leaf lettuce, although there was a difference in the effect of GSSG treatment. The effectiveness of leafy vegetables with high zinc content in ameliorating zinc deficiency was evaluated by feeding lettuce with high zinc content to zinc-deficient mice. High zinc content lettuce significantly increased the zinc content in the liver, kidneys, gastrocnemius, and tibia of these mice. Conclusion. We established a cultivation method for lettuce and komatsuna with high zinc content without inhibiting growth by adjusting the zinc concentration in the hydroponic solution at an appropriate concentration for an appropriate period. The result of feeding test indicates that the intake of leafy vegetables with high zinc content can ameliorate zinc deficiency and might be useful in protection from several diseases associated with this deficiency. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

A.; Ran Zhang; Kwang Sik Lee; Byung Rae Jin; Zhongzheng Gui							Effect of the silkworm pupa protein-glucose conjugate on the thermal stability and antioxidant activity of anthocyanins.		Food & Function					Anthocyanin (cyanidin-3-O-glucose) is a natural water-soluble pigment with a robust antioxidant capacity. However, its poor stability and bioavailability limits its application as a functional food ingredient. This study explored the ability of the silkworm pupa protein-glucose (Spp-Glu) conjugate, developed under wet-heating conditions, to improve the thermal stability and antioxidant activity of cyanidin-3-O-glucose (C3G) at pH 3.0 and 6.8. The characterization experiments suggested that C3G complexed with the Spp-Glu conjugate could modify the protein's microenvironment and cause unfolding of the protein's secondary structures under varied pH conditions. Spectroscopic techniques further revealed the formation of complexes via hydrophobic interactions and static quenching processes when C3G was bound to Spp or Spp-Glu. The formation of these complexes effectively attenuated C3G degradation, thereby enhancing its stability under heat treatment over a range of pH values, and the experiments measuring antioxidant activity suggested that the Spp-Glu conjugate formed does not affect the efficacy of C3G after complexation. Therefore, our study suggests that Spp-Glu has the potential to effectively protect and deliver anthocyanins during industrial application for functional food formulation. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.		zhang, yue/GQP-5565-2022								2021	12	9	4132	4141	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00333j					FSTA:2021-09-Sp5130
J		Atudorei, D.; Atudorei, O.; Codina, G. G.							Dough rheological properties, microstructure and bread quality of wheat-germinated bean composite flour.		Foods					Germinated bean flour (GBF) was obtained and incorporated in different levels (5%, 10%, 15%, 20% and 25%) into dough and bread made from refined wheat flour. The incorporation of GBF into wheat flour led to a decrease of the water absorption value, dough consistency, baking strength, extensibility and improved tolerance for mixing, total gas production and alpha-amylase activity. Tan delta increased in a frequency-dependent manner for the samples with a GBF addition, whereas the G" and G" decreased with the increased value of the temperature. According to the microscopic structures of the dough samples, a decrease of the starch area may be clearly seen for the samples with high levels of GBF addition in wheat flour. The bread evaluation showed that the specific volume, porosity and elasticity increased, whereas the firmness, gumminess and chewiness decreased up to a level of 15% GBF addition in wheat flour. The color parameters L*, a* and b* of the bread samples indicated a darkening effect of GBF on the crumb and crust. From the sensory point of view, the bread up to a 15% GBF addition was well-appreciated by the panelists. According to the data obtained, GBF could be recommended for use as an improver, especially up to a level of 15% addition in the bread-making industry. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Atzei, A.; Pusceddu, C.; Caboni, P.; Corrias, F.							Simultaneous determination and dietary risk assessment of clethodim and its metabolites in different fruits and vegetables.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Clethodim is one of the most widely used herbicides in agriculture and, after field application, is metabolised to several metabolites. The potential toxicological negative effects of these compounds are poorly understood. Thus, recently, within the risk assessment framework, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) proposed to include the minor metabolites in the definition of clethodim residue. In this work, an easy to use and reliable UHPLC method coupled with a triple quadrupole MS/MS was developed and validated for the detection and quantification of the herbicide clethodim and related metabolites clethodim sulphone, clethodim sulphoxide, metabolites M17R and M18R in apple, grape, olive and rice. The five analytes were extracted by using a modified QuEChERS procedure, while the active ingredients were determined in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) ion-switching mode. The proposed method showed calibration curve linearity with r2 ≥ 0.990 for all active ingredients (a.is.) both in solvent and matrix extracts. Limits of quantitation (LOQ) of the five compounds ranged from 9.44 g/kg for M17R in olive extract to 11.01 g/kg for clethodim in apple extract. Recoveries values ranged from 86% to 119% at two concentration levels (LOQ and 10xLOQ), while the intraday and interday precisions of the method were both below 10% in all cases. The method was successfully used for the quantification of the five a. Is. In different food matrices. Furthermore, chronic dietary risk was investigated using a hazard quotients (HQ) method based on European dietary habits. The chronic dietary exposure risk quotients ranged from 1.0 * 10-5 (lower bound scenario) to 2.7 * 10-4 (upper bound scenario) which were significantly lower than 1. Data obtained indicate that the dietary exposure risks were acceptable for clethodim and its major and minor metabolites applied in apple, table grape, rice and table olive. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Investigation of different dietary-fibre-ingredients for the design of a fibre enriched bread formulation low in FODMAPs based on wheat starch and vital gluten.		European Food Research and Technology					Consumption of fermentable oligo-, di-, monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAPs) often induces symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Since FODMAPs and dietary fibre (DF) share certain characteristics, IBS-patients have a limited intake of DF. Therefore, enrichment of a low FODMAP model bread (based on 84% wheat starch and 16% vital gluten) with various fibres (bamboo, cellulose, psyllium, guar gum) in two different concentrations (3 g/100 g and 6 g/100 g) was investigated. Physico-chemical properties of doughs and breads were analysed (fermentation quality, gluten development, specific volume and hardness), as well as the release of reducing sugars during in vitro digestion. High performance anion exchange chromatography with coupled pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) was used to determine the FODMAP levels (contents of mannitol, sorbitol, fructose in excess of glucose, fructans and alpha-galactooligosaccharides) of both dough and bread. Prototypes were compared with wheat flour-based breads (bakers' flour with and without wheat bran addition) to assess the performance of these prototypes. Prototypes showed a decreased quality compared to a baker's flour control, however, a quality comparable to commercial wheat bran breads was found. This in combination with a lower release of reducing sugars during in vitro digestion underline the potential of fibre enriched breads as part of a healthier and more palateable low FODMAP diet. Furthermore, this study highlights the importance of the type (viscous and insoluble) and the concentration of fibres used. Application of psyllium in a concentration of 3 g/100 g showed the most beneficial impact on both physical (specific volume, hardness after 0 h and 24 h) and nutritional aspects of bread. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Assessment of feed and economic efficiency of dairy farms based on multivariate aggregation of partial indicators measured on field.		Journal of Dairy Science					Many of the metrics used to evaluate farm performance are only partial indicators of farm operations, which are assumed to be best predictors of the whole farm efficiency. The main objective of this work was to identify aggregated multiple indexes of profitability using common partial indicators that are routinely available from individual farms to better support the short-term decision-making processes of the cattle-feeding process. Data were collected from face-to-face interviews with farmers from 90 dairy farms in Italy and used to calculate 16 partial indicators that covered almost all indicators currently used to target feeding and economic efficiency in dairy farms. These partial indicators described feed efficiency, energy utilization, feed costs, milk-to-feed price ratio, income over feed costs, income equal feed cost, money-corrected milk, and bargaining power for feed costs. Calculations of feeding costs were based on lactating cows or the whole herd, and income from milk deliveries was determined with or without considering the milk quality payment. Multivariate factor analysis was then applied to the 16 partial indicators to determine simplified and latent structures. The results indicated that 5 factors explained 70% of the variability. Each of the original partial indicator was associated with all factors in different proportions, as indicated by loading scores from the multivariate factor analysis. Based on the loading scores, we labeled these 5 factors as "economic efficiency," "energy utilization," "break-even point," "milk-to-feed price," and "bargaining power of the farm," in decreasing order of explained communality. The first 3 factors shared 83% of the total communality. Feed efficiency was similarly associated with factor 1 (53% loading) and factor 2 (66% loading). Only factor 4 was significantly affected by farm location. Milk production and herd size had significant effects on factor 1 and factor 2. Our multivariate approach eliminated the problem of multicollinearity of partial indicators, providing simple and effective descriptions of farm feeding economics. The proposed method allowed the evaluation, benchmarking, and ranking of dairy herd performance at the level of single farms and at territorial level with high opportunity to be used or replicated in other areas.

J		Aubert, C.; Bruaut, M.; Chalot, G.; Cottet, V.							Impact of maturity stage at harvest on the main physicochemical characteristics, the levels of vitamin C, polyphenols and volatiles and the sensory quality of Gariguette strawberry.		European Food Research and Technology					In this study, quality parameters (color, soluble solids content, titratable acidity), levels of sugars, organic acids, vitamin C, polyphenols and volatiles were determined during two successive years in Gariguette strawberries harvested at two stages of maturity (turning stage and fully ripe). Fruits were analyzed at harvest and after 2 days of storage at 10 °C. The descriptive sensory analyses of the samples were also performed by a trained panel. Whether at harvest or after storage, no significant difference was observed for sugars between samples, but strawberries harvested fully ripe had lower organic acids and higher levels of volatiles. Consistent with these results, strawberries harvested fully ripe were significantly noted sweeter and more aromatic than those harvested 75% red. No significant difference was observed for total vitamin C between samples, but strawberries harvested fully ripe were overall richer in polyphenols, particularly in hydroxycinnamic acids. This suggests strawberries harvested fully ripe could potentially have a greater impact on health. ©Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Nutritional and healthy value of chemical constituents obtained from patagonian squid (Doryteuthis gahi) by-products captured at different seasons.		Foods					This study focuses on the extraction of nutritional and healthy constituents of whole by-products resulting from the commercialisation of Patagonian squid (Doriteuthis gahi). By-products corresponding to squid individuals captured at different seasons were comparatively analysed for proximate composition, lipid classes content, fatty acid (FA) profile, and macroelement and trace element composition. As a result, moisture, lipid, protein, and ash values were included in the ranges 829.0-842.8, 17.5-21.8, 106.0-123.7, and 9.3-13.3 g.kg-1 by-products, respectively. Phospholipids showed to be the most abundant lipid class (359.2-463.5 g.kg-1 lipids), while triacylglycerols were only present in a 9.5-13.1 g.kg-1 lipids range. Valuable levels were detected for alpha-tocopherol (539.6-973.3 mg.kg-1 lipids), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA; 50.5-52.6 g. 100 g-1 FA), omega3 PUFA (47.0-48.6 g. 100 g-1 FA), PUFA/saturated FA ratio (1.4-1.6), and omega3/omega6 ratio (12.1-13.4). Among macroelements, S, P, and Na showed to be more abundant than K, Mg, and Ca. Profitable levels of Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn were detected in all kinds of individuals. In spite of content variations found as a result of the capture season of Patagonian squid individuals, whole by-products of this cephalopod species can be considered as a profitable source to provide the food and pharmaceutical industries with useful value-added constituents. © 2021 by the authors.

The structure and composition of extracted pectin and residual cell wall material from processing tomato: the role of a stepwise approach versus high-pressure homogenization-facilitated acid extraction.		Foods					In literature, different pectin extraction methods exist. In this study, two approaches starting from the alcohol-insoluble residue (AIR) of processing tomato are performed in a parallel way to facilitate the comparison of pectin yield and the compositional and structural properties of the extracted pectin and residual cell wall material obtained. On the one hand, pectin is extracted stepwise using hot water, chelating agents and low-alkaline conditions targeting fractionation of the pectin population. On the other hand, an industrially relevant single-step nitric acid pectin extraction (pH 1.6) is performed. In addition to these conventional solvent pectin extractions, the role of high-pressure homogenization (HPH) as a physically disruptive treatment to facilitate further pectin extraction from the partially pectin-depleted fraction obtained after acid extraction is addressed. The impact of HPH on the pectin cell wall polysaccharide interactions was shown as almost two thirds of the residual pectin were extractable during the subsequent extractions. For both extraction approaches, pectin obtained further in the sequence was characterized by a higher molecular mass and a higher amount of rhamnogalacturonan I domains. The estimated hemicellulose and cellulose content increased from 56 mol% for the AIR to almost 90 mol% for the final unextractable fractions of both methods. © 2021 by the authors.

Microstructural and texturizing properties of partially pectin-depleted cell wall material: the role of botanical origin and high-pressure homogenization.		Foods					In the current study, the texturizing properties of partially pectin-depleted cell wall material (CWM) of apple, carrot, onion and pumpkin, and the potential of functionalization by high-pressure homogenization (HPH) were addressed. This partially pectin-depleted CWM was obtained as the unextractable fraction after acid pectin extraction (AcUF) on the alcohol-insoluble residue. Chemical analysis was performed to gain insight into the polysaccharide composition of the AcUF. The microstructural and functional properties of the AcUF in suspension were studied before HPH and after HPH at 20 and 80 MPa. Before HPH, even after the pectin extraction, the particles showed a cell-like morphology and occurred separately in the apple, onion and pumpkin AcUF and in a clustered manner in the carrot AcUF. The extent of disruption by the HPH treatments at 20 and 80 MPa was dependent on the botanical origin. Only for the onion and pumpkin AcUF, the water binding capacity was increased by HPH. Before HPH, the texturizing potential of the AcUFs was greatly varying between the different matrices. Whereas HPH improved the texturizing potential of the pumpkin AcUF, no effect and even a decrease was observed for the onion AcUF and the apple and carrot AcUF, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					This study evaluated, at a meso-scale, the antifungal effect of 405 nm LED illumination against Botrytis cinerea and Rhizopus stolonifer on tomatoes, as well as its effect of on the physicochemical properties. Tomatoes were surface-inoculated with B. cinerea and R. stolonifer, and illuminated with 87 W/m2 for twelve days. Subsequently, the antifungal effect, defined as the difference in mold populations on the control and illuminated samples, was observed to be 1.9 log CFU/g for B. cinerea and 3.2 log CFU/g for R. stolonifer. In terms of physicochemical effects, beginning from day 9, the total phenolic content, TEAC and vitamin C content of illuminated samples was significantly higher (P > 0.05) by 24.6 %, 28.2 % and 16.5 %, respectively, compared to control, but a greater reduction in mass and lycopene content was also observed. Overall, these results suggest the potential of 405 nm LEDs for controlling mold growth on tomatoes during transportation and storage, retaining their physicochemical quality.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Trans-fatty acid (TFA) elimination from global food supply is a 2023 World Health Organization target. Brazil adopted the limit for TFA at 2 g/100 g fat to be implemented by 2023. This work aimed to evaluate the fat profile of about 600 industrialized products from Sao Paulo state, Brazil, between 2005 and 2018. The total fat (TF) was determined by gravimetric methods and the fatty acids by gas chromatography. The mean contents of TFA were higher than 2 g/100 g fat in 30% of samples (bakery products, potato chips, snacks, hamburgers, margarine, and spread). The highest mean content was verified in biscuits: cassava and salty (20.5 and 7.1 g/100 g fat). TFA mean contents evaluated over time decrease in sweet biscuit (4.9 to 1.2), potato chips (4.2 to 1.8), soybean oil (2.1 to 1.2), and canola oil (3.5 to 0.7) (g/100 g fat), whereas saturated and mainly polyunsaturated fatty acids in sweet biscuits and potato chips increased. Palm and polyunsaturated oils and interesterified fat have been used to avoid partially hydrogenated oils. Continuous monitoring of foods is essential to help in both government and corporate actions in adapting their products and meeting current regulatory restrictions on the content of TFA.

J		Augustine, D. A.; Bent, G. A.; Nelson, P. N.							Mechanistic evidence for the effect of sulphur-based additive: methionine, on acrylamide reduction.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The unavoidable presence of acrylamide in foods has fuelled the search for a suitable food additive, one that can successfully mitigate dietary acrylamide levels without changing food quality or compromising the health of consumers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of a sulphur-based additive and amino acid, methionine, on acrylamide reduction. Differential scanning calorimetry, supported by chromatographic measurements, has shown that methionine interacts with acrylamide at a possible optimum temperature of 160°C, thereby disfavouring acrylamide polymerisation. Analysis of the methionine-acrylamide interaction via density functional theoretical modelling (DFT/6-31+ G (d) /RCAM-B3LYP) revealed that methionine's reducing effect may be driven by a Michael-type conjugation of the vinyl group of acrylamide at both the sulphur atom (DeltaGf = -53 kJ mol-1) and the amino group (DeltaGf = -11.84 kJ mol-1) of methionine. The former conjugation pathway results in a product that is more thermodynamically feasible. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Baobab seed oil, obtained from the seed kernel of Adansonia digitata from Southern Africa, has experienced an increase in global demand. 1H and 13C NMR was used for the authentication of the baobab oils, allowing for the quantification of the characteristic cyclopropane and cyclopropene fatty acids. Through similarity analysis, differential NMR spectroscopy and multivariate data analysis substantial differences were observed in commercial samples, segregating the oil samples into two groups. The cyclopropane and cyclopropene fatty acids, were absent in one group of the samples, raising the possibility of falsification. Similarity analysis and multivariate data analysis, in which the spectral data were compared with those of fourteen other vegetable oils, indicated a high correlation between the potentially falsified baobab seed oils and soybean oil. A comparison of the phytosterol markers of the oils by differential NMR confirmed the adulteration with soybean oil.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This research aimed to evaluate effects of starch source, sucrose at high concentration and coconut milk on physical properties of chilled and frozen starch gels, considered as traditional Thai dessert models. Gel containing 15% w/w of starch was prepared from rice starch, tapioca starch or blended rice starch/tapioca starch (1:0.85 w/w) mixed with water, 45°Bx sucrose solution or coconut milk. The result showed that rice starch gel stored at 4 °C had highest hardness, degree of syneresis and melting enthalpy of the retrograded structure (DeltaHret). Degree of syneresis of frozen rice starch gels subjected to several freezing-thawing cycles was also highest. Under chilled temperature storage, starch gels containing sucrose or coconut milk had higher hardness and denser gel structure, comparing to the starch gels in water. This textural change was due to greater degree of starch retrogradation, sucrose recrystallization and/or formation of amylose-lipid complex crystallites shown in X-ray diffractograms. However, addition of highly concentrated sucrose or coconut milk increased freeze-thaw stability of the frozen starch gels, as shown by decreasing degree of syneresis. Results. From this study could be applied to formulate starch-based dessert with improved quality during chilled or frozen storage.

J		Aureli, V.; Scalvedi, M. L.; Rossi, L.							Food waste of Italian families: proportion in quantity and monetary value of food purchases.		Foods					Halving per capita food waste (FW) is one of the objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals. This study aims to evaluate the weight and monetary values of food waste among a sample of Italian families. In a representative sample of 1142 families, the adults responsible for food purchases and in charge of preparing meals were assessed with a self-administrated questionnaire measuring quantity and typology of FW. These data were linked with food purchases figures measured as an average of four weeks. Italian families wasted 399 kg of food per week (4.4% of the weight of food purchased), which correspond to a monetary value of 1.052 (3.8% of the overall food expenditure). Clustering the food groups according to waste quantity, typology, and monetary value made it possible to show that price has a role in the generation of food waste, as the lower the unitary cost, the higher the quantity of waste. Consequently, foods with high unitary costs were less wasted. The results of this study showed that Italian consumers are sensitive to the economic impact of waste and this should be considered in sensitization campaigns. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to compare the methods of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) on the lipid oxidation of chicken mortadella with substitution (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of chicken skin by green banana biomass (GBB) for 90 days of storage. The NMR method was correlated with the Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), medium-infrared spectroscopy, flame ionization gas chromatography (GC-FID), and physical-chemical parameters. During 90 days of storage, TBARS values ranged from 2.16 to 2.56 mg/kg-1. NMR showed appearance of allylic protons and there was an increase of the trans fatty acids content over 90 days in relation to the first day of storage with the decrease of GBB concentration. The lipid content was highly correlated with allylic protons and trans fatty acids content (R2 values ranged from 0.952 to 0.965), revealing that NMR is an efficient methodology with high precision for determination of lipid oxidation. Practical applications. Lipid oxidation is one of the main problems found in the processing and storage of emulsified meats, once these products present a high fat content. In this context, the present study suggested the use of green banana biomass as fat replacement in chicken mortadella, and the results showed a reduction in the total fat content as well as a lower concentration of trans fatty acids. In addition, this work presented understanding regarding the NMR method as the most indicated method in relation to the usual method, TBARS, to evaluate lipid oxidation during 90 days of storage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Green banana biomass: physicochemical and functional properties and its potential as a fat replacer in a chicken mortadella.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The potential of green banana biomass (GBB) as a natural ingredient and its impact as a fat replacer in chicken mortadella on sensory perception were investigated. The GBB was assessed for physicochemical characterization, antioxidant capacity and antimicrobial activity. Five chicken mortadella formulations were developed with fat replacement of 25, 50, 75 and 100% by GBB. Microbiological stability of the formulations was assessed, and the sensory profiling was evaluated by Preferred Attribute Elicitation (PAE). The dietary fiber, resistant starch, total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity in GBB were 3.99%, 4.16%, 518.39 mg GAE/100 g (GAE: Gallic acid equivalent) of dry sample, 5307.62 mumol of trolox equivalent (TE) /100 g of dry sample and 3583.12 mumol of trolox equivalent (TE)/100 g of dry sample, respectively. GBB contained potassium (1121 mg/100 g), phosphorus (183.6 mg/100 g), magnesium (77.4 mg/100 g), copper (0.53 mg/100 g) and iron (7.21 mg/100 g). The microbial counts in the formulations after 90 days of chill storage were within the safe limit. The results concluded that GBB showed desirable functional and technological proprieties to be used in chicken mortadella without affecting the characteristic flavor of these products. Besides, PAE proved to be a potential method to characterize chicken mortadella. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Auxzilia Preethi, K.; Durairaj Sekar							Dietary microRNAs: current status and perspective in food science.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Food safety and health conditions are global issues that are primarily caused by insufficient nutrition or contaminated food, which have enormous social, economic, and public health implications. Foodomics study mainly involves nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics, and nutritional epigenetics, which help in finding the correlation between genetic variation and nutrient-driven epigenetic alterations that are suggested as a primary challenge to nutritional needs. Micro-ribonucleic acids (miRNAs) are non-coding RNA molecules that have recently gained in popularity as a result of their critical roles in gene regulation and nutritional studies. In this commentary, the relevance of miRNAs to human nutrition is discussed. This study emphasizes the importance of dietary miRNAs based on numerous independent studies, which have explained the unique characteristics of dietary miRNAs in terms of gene expression regulation mechanism. There is an urgent requirement of measurement techniques to detect miRNA in food and evolutionary samples. These techniques may be helpful to find even low levels of miRNAs because of their high susceptibility and selectivity. There is a desperate requisite to evaluate the impact of dietary supplement compounds on circulating and tissue miRNAs. Food science studies in humans may aid in the identification of novel biomarkers and other necessary mode of action of certain dietary compounds, with the goal of facilitating how nutrients and bioactive components can influence miRNAs and enforce biological effects. Practical applications. Dietary microRNAs may be helpful to find even the low levels of miRNAs due to their high susceptibility and selectivity. There is also desperate need to evaluate the impact of dietary supplement compounds effect on circulating and tissue miRNAs. There is also requirement for new analytical tools to study the role of gene regulations and nutrition in different diseases. The quality of dietary miRNAs should be investigated, particularly the exogenous types which are used as high doses in food supplements. It would also be of great interest to use antagomir technology in food science research, in addition to omics technology. Dietary miRNAs may also aid in the identification of novel biomarkers. These are some of the practical applications of dietary miRNAs. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13827					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14628

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, 103 water, agricultural soil, and crops irrigated with wastewater or tube-well water were collected, and their heavy metal content was evaluated using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The Monte Carlo simulation method was used for exposure assessment and investigation of the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic effects of the studied elements in the crops. The results showed that the mean heavy metal contents of agricultural soil was lower than the suggested limit, except for Ni (8427mg/kg dry weight). The mean concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu, Pb, Cr, As, Co, Ni, Cd, and Hg in the crops were 3135.7, 3.73, 3.22, 0.980.7, 0.280.4, 0.140.1, 0.060.06, 0.030.04, 0.190.15, 0.030.06, and 0.010.06 mg/kg fresh weight, respectively. The non-carcinogenic risk of As was 1.5E+00 in the agricultural soil and 1.47E+00 in the crops (target hazard quotient >1.0). Moreover, the carcinogenic risk of As was 1.15E-04, which is higher than the safe level in children (1*10-6). Also, the carcinogenic risk of Ni, Cd, and As in most vegetables was higher than the tolerable limit (1*10-6). In conclusion, the present results provided some basic information about heavy metal contamination of crops and human health risks in Hamadan, Iran.

J		Avadi, A.; Acosta-Alba, I.							Eco-efficiency of the fisheries value chains in the Gambia and Mali.		Foods					The Gambian and Malian fisheries and fish processing value chains are predominantly artisanal and represent a key source of protein and livelihoods, yet their eco-efficiency has not been studied to date. A Life Cycle Assessment was used to estimate the associated environmental impacts of those value chains and provide information on the eco-efficiency indicators, which relate technical efficiencies to environmental impacts. The results showed that industrial Gambian fleets; fuel use efficiency is rather low as compared with the global mean fuel use intensity (landed fish/consumed fuel) for both small pelagics and demersal fish. In Mali, the fuel use intensity of motorised artisanal fisheries is lower than the mean values for artisanal inland fisheries in developing countries, but the important increase of frozen imported fish from fish farming multiplies the estimated impacts by four. The least energy-intensive fisheries (cast nets and stow nets in Gambia and opportunistic fishers in Mali) feature better eco-efficiency scores. Based on the identified sources of inefficiencies, we suggest improvements in the landing/processing infrastructure and fishing units' engines, coupled with technical and business training and improved processing methods, to ameliorate seafood eco-efficiency and a stronger recognition of the importance of the artisanal fisheries subsector to overcome challenges and improving resource management. © 2021 by the authors.

Gelation kinetics of aqueous gelatin solutions in isothermal conditions via rheological tools.		Food Hydrocolloids					We investigate the sol-gel transition of aqueous pig-skin gelatin solutions at different concentrations and temperatures. In particular, we characterize the isothermal gelation kinetics close to the critical melting temperature, previously evaluated with dynamic temperature ramp tests. The time evolution of the moduli is analyzed at a specific fixed frequency and at various temperatures and concentrations. The isothermal study allows to evaluate the gel time and to determine its dependence on concentration and temperature. The study of the gelation kinetics over a wide range of concentrations allows to link the behavior in solution to the gelation phenomenon, confirming a different temperature dependence of the sol-gel transition according to the concentration regime Although some models are available to describe this dependence, they do not simultaneously account for the effect of both parameters (i.e.temperature and concentration). Here, we propose a full empirical model that accommodates the dependence upon both temperature and concentration. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Avgoustaki, D. D.; Bartzanas, T.; Xydis, G.							Minimising the energy footprint of indoor food production while maintaining a high growth rate: introducing disruptive cultivation protocols.		Food Control					The majority of the cultivated species in indoor vertical farms require many hours of light each day to reach their full potential in terms of biomass, leaf size, nutritional value, taste, and colour. At the same time, the cost of electricity can be very high due to the many hours of operation, which can be an inhibiting factor for the advancement of technology and the profitability of the farm. In this study, we tested the growth of basil plants (Ocimum basilicum) under continuous and intermittent photoperiods. The leaf physiological traits of three different photoperiod treatments were assessed and used to estimate the toleration rate of the plants under different light schedules. In the first indoor growth chamber, the plants were grown under 16 h of continuous light, in the second chamber under a normal photoperiod of 14 h with intermittent light, and in the third chamber under a load-shifting demand response with 14 h of intermittent light. The purpose was to evaluate and design flexible intermittent light exposure to reduce the electricity consumption for crops grown in indoor environments while maintaining a high growth rate and biomass production of the plants. The presented results of this experimental research show a positive correlation of the plants' responses to abiotic stress when exposed to short 10-min periods of intermittent light, without having significant effects on the physiological responses of the cultivation. The physiological, biochemical, and morphological status of the plants were assessed in terms of photosynthetic rate, chlorophyll pigments, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rate of the plants. The protocol with intermittent light exposure induced a significantly 47% increase in biomass production compared to the continuous photoperiod, resulting in a more economical, sustainable, business, and ecological impact on the energy footprint of indoor food production.

J		Avijit Dey; Kiran Attri; Satbir S. Dahiya; Shyam S. Paul							Influence of dietary phytogenic feed additives on lactation performance, methane emissions and health status of Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Several feed additives have been used in recent past to reduce enteric methane production in ruminants. But most of them also inhibit feed digestibility and rumen fermentation, thereby lowering animal performance. Phytogenic feed additives are gaining importance owing to their safety in regard to human health issues. The present study examined the effect of dietary supplementation of phytogenic feed additive containing a blend of poplar (Populus deltoides) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus citriodora) leaves on feed utilization, milk production, methane emissions and health status of Murrah buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis). Results. The daily milk yield, 6% fat corrected milk yield, and fat-protein corrected milk yield were increased (P<0.05) in phytogenic composite feed additive (PCFA)-supplemented buffaloes. A decrease (37.3%) in methane concentration in exhaled air of supplemented buffaloes was evident. The digestibility coefficient of dry matter, organic matter and neutral detergent fibre was increased (P<0.05) in PCFA-fed buffaloes without affecting feed intake. Total digestible nutrient content of the ration fed to buffaloes of the PCFA group was significantly (P<0.05) increased. The buffaloes fed PCFA exhibited an enhanced cell-mediated and humoral immune response. Conclusion. A discernible positive impact was evident on overall performances and health status along with lowered methane production of buffaloes fed (15gkg-1 dry matter intake) a blend of phytogenic feed additive composed of leaves of poplar (P. deltoides) and eucalyptus (E. citriodora). © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	10	4390	4397	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11080					FSTA:2021-10-Pe5195

Disposition of dietary polyphenols in breast cancer patients' tumors, and their associated anticancer activity: the particular case of curcumin.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Some polyphenol-derived metabolites reach human breast cancer (BC) tissues at concentrations that induce cell senescence. However, this is unknown for isoflavones, curcuminoids, and lignans. Here, their metabolic profiling in normal (NT) and malignant (MT) mammary tissues of newly-diagnosed BC patients and the tissue-occurring metabolites' anticancer activity are evaluated. Methods and results. Patients (n = 26) consumed 3 capsules/day (turmeric, red clover, and flaxseed extracts plus resveratrol; 296.4 mg phenolics/capsule) from biopsy-confirmed diagnosis to surgery (5 2 days) or did not consume capsules (n = 13). NT and MT, blood, and urine are analyzed by UPLC-QTOF-MS using targeted metabolomics. Anticancer activity was tested in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 BC cells. Mainly phase-II metabolites were detected (108, 84, 49, and 47 in urine, plasma, NT, and MT, respectively). Total metabolite concentrations reached 10.7 11.1 and 2.5 2.4 mol L-1 in NT and MT, respectively. Free curcumin, but not its glucuronide, was detected in the tissues (1.1 1.8 and 0.2 0.2 mol L-1 in NT and MT, respectively). Breast tissue-occurring metabolites' antiproliferation was mainly exerted in p53-wild-type MCF-7 cells by curcuminoids through cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis induction via p53/p21 induction, while isoflavone-derived metabolites exerted estrogenic-like activity. Conclusion. Curcuminoids could be coadjuvants that might help fight BC upon regular consumption. © 2021 The Authors. Molecular Nutrition & Food Research published by Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Foods					Listeria monocytogenes is an important pathogen that has been implicated in foodborne illnesses and the recall of products such as fruit and vegetables. This study determines the prevalence of virulence-associated genes and serogroups and evaluates the effects of different growth media and environmental conditions on biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes. Eighteen L. monocytogenes isolates from Hass avocados sold at markets in Guadalajara, Mexico, were characterized by virulence-associated genes and serogroup detection with PCR. All isolates harbored 88.8% actA, 88.8% plcA, 83.3% mpl, 77.7% inlB, 77.7% hly, 66.6% prfA, 55.5% plcB, and 33.3% inlA. The results showed that 38.8% of isolates harbored virulence genes belonging to Listeria pathogenicity island 1 (LIPI-1). PCR revealed that the most prevalent serogroup was serogroup III (1/2b, 3b, and 7 (n=18, 66.65%)), followed by serogroup IV (4b, 4d-4e (n=5, 27.7%)) and serogroup I (1/2a-3a (n=1, 5.5%)). The assessment of the ability to develop biofilms using a crystal violet staining method revealed that L. monocytogenes responded to supplement medium TSBA, 1/10 diluted TSBA, and TSB in comparison with 1/10 diluted TSB (p< 0.05) on polystyrene at 240 h (p< 0.05). In particular, the biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes (7.780.03-8.820.03 log10 CFU/cm2) was significantly different in terms of TSBA on polypropylene type B (PP) (p< 0.05). In addition, visualization by epifluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and treatment (DNase I and proteinase K) revealed the metabolically active cells and extracellular polymeric substances of biofilms on PP. L. monocytogenes has the ability to develop biofilms that harbor virulence-associated genes, which represent a serious threat to human health and food safety. © 2021 by the authors.

Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains isolated from dairy products: relationship of ica-dependent/independent and components of biofilms produced in vitro.		International Dairy Journal					This study investigated the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in dairy products, and the relationship between polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA) dependence/independence of MRSAs and the components of biofilms produced in vitro. Of 141 samples of dairy products collected, 26% were positive for S. aureus and 14% of S. aureus isolates were MRSA. MRSA biofilms (8.37-9.89 and 9.53-9.59 log10 cfu cm-2 for ica-positive and negative MRSA, respectively, in TSBNaCl on stainless steel) were characterised by epifluorescence microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and biofilm detachment was assessed with DNase I (32-44%) and proteinase K (18-32%) (p< 0.05). MRSA biofilms isolated from dairy products are a source of food contamination, thus a need to implement food safety systems and strategies for biofilm prevention and removal in the dairy industry.

Insights into the optimisation of the Clean-In-Place technique: cleaning, disinfection, and reduced environmental impact using ozone-based formulations.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Chemical and food industries are focusing on reducing the economic and environmental impact of cleaning operations. This study aims to analyse the use of alkaline ozonated formulations to remove starch adhering to stainless steel surfaces, improving disinfection of mature biofilms with Listeria and Pseudomonas, and reducing the environmental impact of wastewater. Three key cleaning parameters have been analysed in a lab-simulated Clean-In-Place system (CIP): temperature (20-60 °C), time (20-120 min), and cleaning formulations containing ozone and surfactant (linear alkylbenzene sulfonate, alkylpolyglucoside, fatty ethoxylated alcohol, lauramine oxide) were assayed. Higher temperature, time, and ozone concentration improved starch removal and disinfection of the stainless-steel surfaces, as well as the environmental impact of cleaning wastewater. Therefore, ozone-based CIP protocols could provide new opportunities to achieve cleaner, greener, and safer industries by intensifying cleaning, disinfection, and wastewater treatment in one step, saving operational costs compared to conventional CIP techniques.

J		Avtar Singh; Soottawat Benjakul; Peng Zhou; Bin Zhang; Shanggui Deng							Effect of squid pen chitooligosaccharide and epigallocatechin gallate on discoloration and shelf-life of yellowfin tuna slices during refrigerated storage.		Food Chemistry					This study evaluated the effects of treatments of squid pen chitooligosaccharide (COS) or epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) or COS/EGCG mixture (1:1, w/w) at different concentrations (0, 200, and 400 mg/kg) on the discoloration and quality changes in yellowfin tuna slices stored at 4 °C for 12 days. Tuna slices added with 200 and 400 mg/kg of COS (C2 and C4, respectively) showed the lowest reduction in oxymyoglobin and a* value (redness) ascertained by the lower metmyoglobin formation than other samples. Additionally, C2 and C4 samples showed a lower total viable count and TBARS value than the remaining samples. EGCG alone and its mixture with COS exhibited lower efficacy in retaining the quality loss than COS alone. COS at both levels effectively reduced the metMb formation. It maintained the redness with sensory acceptability of slices up to 9 days, and C4 sample prolonged shelf-life for 12 days based on the microbiological limit.

J		Avtar Singh; Soottawat Benjakul; Bin Zhang; Shanggui Deng; Ajay Mittal							Effect of squid pen chitooligosaccharide in conjugation with different modified atmospheric packaging conditions on color and storage stability of tuna slices.		Food Control					Effect of squid pen chitooligosaccharide (COS) at different concentrations (0, 400, and 800 ppm) on the discoloration and quality changes in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) slices packed under modified atmospheric packaging (MAP) using oxygen, argon or their mixture at 4 °C up to 9 days was investigated. Tuna slices packed with oxygen-based MAP in the presence of 400 ppm COS (C4-OXY) showed the lowest reduction in oxymyoglobin (oxyMb) and a* value (redness). This coincided with the lowest formation of metmyoglobin (metMb) than other samples (p < 0.05). Additionally, C4-OXY sample showed lower total viable count and lipid oxidation than the remaining samples (p < 0.05). However, argon-based MAP had no positive effect in retaining the quality of tuna slices. Nevertheless, COS at a high concentration (800 ppm) decreased the redness of tuna slices, especially those packed under argon-based MAP. COS generally lowered the oxidation of fatty acids of C4-OXY sample, as indicated by higher polyunsaturated fatty acids content than that of control sample (without COS treatment and kept in air). Overall, COS at 400 ppm in combination with oxygen-based MAP effectively reduced the metMb formation and maintained the redness of slices and prolonged shelf-life of slices with sensory acceptability at 4 °C for 9 days.

J		Avtar Singh; Soottawat Benjakul; Thummanoon Prodpran; Pornpot Nuthong							Effect of psyllium (Plantago ovata Forks) husk on characteristics, rheological and textural properties of threadfin bream surimi gel.		Foods					Effects of psyllium (Plantago ovata) husk powder (PHP) at various concentrations (0, 1, 2, 3 and 4%, w/w) on gelling properties of surimi from threadfin bream (Nemipterus sp.) were investigated. The addition of 1% PHP resulted in the highest increase (50%) in the breaking force (BF) of surimi gel (S), compared to that of the control gel (CON; without PHP). Lower BF was obtained for gel incorporated with PHP at the higher levels (2-4%) (p< 0.05). On the other hand, deformation (DF) was decreased with the addition of PHP at all levels compared to the CON gel. The whiteness and expressible moisture content of gels were decreased with augmenting levels of PHP (p< 0.05). Protein patterns revealed that PHP at all concentrations did not affect the polymerization of the myosin heavy chain. A loss in the elasticity of the gel was attained with the addition of PHP as indicated by decreased storage modulus (G). A finer and more compact network was detected in gels containing 1 and 2% PHP than that found in the CON. FTIR spectra suggested that the addition of PHP influenced the secondary structure as well as functional groups of myofibrillar proteins. Based on the sensory evaluation, the surimi containing PHP at 1-3% showed a similar overall likeness score to the CON.

J		Avtar Singh; Soottawat Benjakul; Pornpot Nuthong; Thummanoon Prodpran							Elemental and structural changes associated with white spot formation in sun-dried Pacific white shrimp shells.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Structural and elemental properties of dried Pacific white shrimp (WSS) (Litopenaeus vannamei) shell having the white spots were compared with non-white spot shrimp (NWSS) shell. Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, both samples showed two characteristic peaks representing chitin. However, WSS sample had two additional major peaks at 2theta of 26.65 and 29.53°, which were related to quartz and calcite, respectively. Scanning electron microscope coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrophotometer (SEM-EDX) mapping showed the movement of various elements towards the exo- and endocuticle. The Raman spectroscopic study confirmed the formation of calcite crystals in the white spots. The looser chitin matrix was obtained for WSS as compared to that of NWSS as depicted in SEM micrographs. Therefore, the white spots developed in the shell were caused by the formation of calcite, which exhibited different structural arrangements and elemental positioning as compared to shrimp shell without white spots. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	6	2760	2767	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14907					FSTA:2021-10-Re3504

Foods					Green beans are a perishable crop, which deteriorate rapidly after harvest, particularly when minimally processed into ready-to-eat fresh-cut green beans. This study investigated the effectiveness of ethanol, ascorbic acid (AsA), tea tree essential oil (TTO), and peppermint essential oil (PMO) on the quality and storability of fresh-cut green bean pods samples stored at 5 °C for 15 days. Our results indicated that samples treated with ethanol, AsA, TTO, and PMO preserved appearance, firmness (except ethanol), chlorophyll content, and moisture compared with the samples without any treatment (control). Additionally, higher vitamin C, total soluble solids (TSS), total sugars, and total phenolic compounds (TPC) were observed in samples treated with ethanol, AsA, TTO, and PMO compared with the control. The most effective treatments for controlling microbial growth were ethanol followed by either TTO or PMO. All the treatments had positive effects on shelf life, maintained quality, and reducing microbial growth during 15 days of cold storage. A particular treatment can be selected based on the economic feasibility and critical control point in the value chain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Journal of Food Biochemistry					Phosphorus (P) flow in agricultural land depends on the P taken off from harvested product, its losses through runoff and fertilizer applied to balance the removed P. Phytic acid (PA), the major storage form of phosphorus (P) in cereal grains is a key anti-nutrient for human and non-ruminants leads to eutrophication of waterways. As the natural non-renewable P reserves are limited, enhancing P use efficiency is needed for field crops. SULTR-like phosphorus distribution transporter (SPDT) is a novel rice transporter transfer P to the grain. Any alteration in transporter gene reduce grain P with concomitant rise in the leaves. A low PA (3.0 g/kg) rice Khira was identified where a single nucleotide mutation in LOC_Os06g05160 gene encoding SPDT showed low P transportation to grain. An amino acid change was detected as Valine-330 to Alanine at the 3′ end of fifth exon. Highest expression of SPDT was observed in node I of rice as compared to low PA genotype. The mutation in SPDT could significantly affect P and PA accumulation in the grains with increased mineral bioavailability. Practical applications. Excessive P application in crop leads to higher production cost as well as rapid depletion of limited rock phosphate. Alteration of P transporter function in the rice lower PA and total P accumulation in the grains with increased mineral bioavailability. The re-distributed P in the straw can be applied as manure to the rice field. Thus, less P will be removed from the field, result in the decreased requirement for P fertilizer. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13822					FSTA:2021-10-Me6153
J		Awais Khan; Muhammad Nadeem; Muhammad Imran; Anjum Khalique							Impact of winterization on fatty acids' composition, isomers, and oxidative stability of conjugated linoleic acids produced from selected vegetable oils.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Degummed, refined, winterized (at -60 °C), and non-winterized soybean, sunflower, cottonseed, and safflower oil samples were used for the production of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) by urea treatment. Fatty acids' composition and CLA isomers of winterized and non-winterized versions of oil were analyzed on GC-MS. Winterization improved the concentration of linoleic acids (LAs) in all vegetable oils. Safflower oil exhibited the highest concentration of LAs at 84.19% followed by sunflower oil (68.54%), cottonseed oil (63.74%), and soybean oil (59.88%), respectively. In safflower oil derived CLAs, concentrations of Delta9 c, 11 t-18:2, Delta10 t, 12 c-18:2, Delta9 c, 11 c-18:2, Delta10c, 12 t-18:2, Delta8, 9, 11,10, 12c-c18:2, and Delta8, 9, 11,10, 12t-t18:2 were calculated 47.68%, 39.95%, 5.42%, 1.89%, 3.06%, 0.55%, and 1.45%, while in winterized safflower oil derived CLAs, these concentrations were 55.67%, 41.92%, 0.19%, 0.78%, 0.65%, 0.47%, and 0.32%, respectively, with significant difference in induction period and peroxide value. Yield of CLA from winterize soybean, sunflower cottonseed, and safflower oil was 22.58%, 24.95%, 23.16%, and 36.68%. Practical applications: Conjugated linoleic acids (CLAs) are naturally present in milk, dairy products, and beef. However, the amount of CLAs in dairy products and beef accounts limited moreover, the yield of CLA supplement produced from safflower oil is about 20%. To make the industrial processes economical, and sustainable fortification strategies, yield of CLA supplement should be increased. In the current study, winterized version of sunflower, soybean, cottonseed, and safflower oils were used to produce CLA supplement. Using winterized version, the yield of CLA supplement from safflower oil was increased to 36.68%. This work is highly suitable for the food industries to produce functional foods containing CLA. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15254					FSTA:2021-07-Ne1563
J		Awobusuyi, T. D.; Oyeyinka, S. A.; Siwela, M.; Amonsou, E. O.							Nutritional properties of provitamin A-biofortified maize amahewu prepared using different inocula.		Food Bioscience					Amahewu is a traditional fermented beverage made from white maize that is widely consumed in South Africa. In this study, amahewu was prepared from provitamin A-biofortified maize (PBM) and different inocula and the nutritional properties of the beverage were assessed using standard methods. The amahewu samples were prepared by fermenting maize porridge using lactobacillus starter culture (LSC), wheat bran (WB) and malted provitamin A maize (MM) together with either MM or WB. The inoculum types did not substantially influence the overall composition of amahewu. Carbohydrate (82%) followed by protein (12%) were the major nutrients in all samples. However, inoculating amahewu beverage with LSC substantially reduced the fermentation time. Iron, zinc, and lysine contents increased slightly after fermentation, especially in the sample with added LSC. Protein digestibilities of amahewu samples also increased slightly after fermentation. The beta-carotene contents (approx. 1.8mug/g) were very similar across amahewu samples and these were substantially retained after fermentation. Hence, PBM may be a better alternative to white maize for the preparation of amahewu beverage with improved nutritional quality. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					Lettuce is an important dietary source of bioactive phytochemicals. Screening and identification of the health beneficial metabolites and evaluating the relationships with phenotypic characters can help consumers adjust their preferences for lettuce plant types. Thus, we explored the major health-beneficial individual metabolites and antioxidant potential of 113 red pigmented lettuce leaf samples. A UV-Vis spectrophotometer and UPLC-DAD-QTOF/MS (TQ/MS) instruments were used for the identification and quantification of metabolites and antioxidant activity accordingly. The metabolites were quantified against their corresponding external standards. The contents of metabolites varied significantly among lettuce samples. Cyanidin 3-O-(6'-O-malonyl) glucoside (4.7~5013.6 mug/g DW), 2,3-di-O-caffeoyltartaric acid (337.1~19,957.2 mug/g DW), and quercetin 3-O-(6'-O-malonyl) glucoside (45.4~31,121.0 mug/g DW) were the most dominant in red pigmented lettuce samples among anthocyanins, hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives, and flavonols, respectively. Lettuces with dark and very dark red pigmented leaves, circular leaf shape, a strong degree of leaf undulation, and highly dense leaf incisions were found to have high levels of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamoyl derivatives. Principal component analysis was used to investigate similarities and/or differences between samples, and the partial least square discriminant analysis classified them into known groups. The key variables that contributed highly were determined. Our report provides critical data on the bioactive constituents of red pigmented lettuce to breeders developing varieties with enhanced bioactive compounds and to nutraceutical companies developing nutrient dense foods and pharmaceutical formulations. © 2021 by the authors.

Mycotoxins affecting animals, foods, humans, and plants: types, occurrence, toxicities, action mechanisms, prevention, and detoxification strategies-a revisit.		Foods					Mycotoxins are produced by fungi and are known to be toxic to humans and animals. Common mycotoxins include aflatoxins, ochratoxins, zearalenone, patulin, sterigmatocystin, citrinin, ergot alkaloids, deoxynivalenol, fumonisins, trichothecenes, Alternaria toxins, tremorgenic mycotoxins, fusarins, 3-nitropropionic acid, cyclochlorotine, sporidesmin, etc. These mycotoxins can pose several health risks to both animals and humans, including death. As several mycotoxins simultaneously occur in nature, especially in foods and feeds, the detoxification and/or total removal of mycotoxins remains challenging. Moreover, given that the volume of scientific literature regarding mycotoxins is steadily on the rise, there is need for continuous synthesis of the body of knowledge. To supplement existing information, knowledge of mycotoxins affecting animals, foods, humans, and plants, with more focus on types, toxicity, and prevention measures, including strategies employed in detoxification and removal, were revisited in this work. Our synthesis revealed that mycotoxin decontamination, control, and detoxification strategies cut across pre-and post-harvest preventive measures. In particular, pre-harvest measures can include good agricultural practices, fertilization/irrigation, crop rotation, using resistant varieties of crops, avoiding insect damage, early harvesting, maintaining adequate humidity, and removing debris from the preceding harvests. On the other hand, post-harvest measures can include processing, chemical, biological, and physical measures. Additionally, chemical-based methods and other emerging strategies for mycotoxin detoxification can involve the usage of chitosan, ozone, nanoparticles, and plant extracts. © 2021 by the authors.

Effects of microsecond pulsed electric field (musPEF) and modular micro reaction system (MMRS) treatments on whey protein aggregation.		International Dairy Journal					Electric field (EF) processing has been suggested to be a promising technology in the valorisation of side-streams, such as whey, by enhancing the functionality of biomacromolecules. Shifting from batch to continuous processes and utilising more industry-relevant matrices are of great interest, yet studies thereof are lacking. A continuous plate-plate microsecond pulsed electric field (musPEF) setup was optimised and whey protein concentrate (10%, w/w) was treated at 3 kV cm-1, 10 mus, 40-50 Hz. A diffuser inlet/outlet improved the process stability considerably. Average outlet temperatures between 64.1 °C and 73.2 °C were investigated and aggregate formation between 0.04 mum and 2000 mum was quantified. musPEF-triggered particles were compared with those obtained in thermal treatments, conducted in a modular micro reaction system (MMRS) with similar temperature and residence times. A comparison of the Sauter mean diameter revealed that in the given EF process window, mainly thermal effects were responsible for aggregation shifts. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Chemical characterization of carob seeds (Ceratonia siliqua L.) and use of different extraction techniques to promote its bioactivity.		Food Chemistry					Nowadays, the use of carob (Ceratonia siliqua L.) is reduced to its seeds. In fact, the food additive E410, locust bean gum, is obtained from its endosperm. However, the available information regarding the bioactive potential of carob seeds is limited and, often, with poorly established terminologies, not allowing the reader to know if the studied samples included seedless or seeded samples. So, the present study intended to carry out a chemical characterization of carob seeds focused on their bioactive compounds and test their bioactive properties. Carob seeds proved to be a source of tocopherols and organic acids, including phenolic compounds. Its antioxidant potential was demonstrated in vitro, as well as its antimicrobial capacity. This work proves that carob seeds have other functions in addition to those associated with E410. Thus, another potential can be given to the locust bean seed, namely the function of food preservative. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ayala-Aponte, A.; Cardenas-Nieto, J.; Tirado, D.							Aloe vera gel drying by refractance window: drying kinetics and high-quality retention.		Foods					In most cases, conventional drying produces inferior quality products and requires higher drying times. A continuous pilot Refractance Window equipment was used to dry Aloe vera gel slabs of 5 and 10 mm thick at 60, 70, 80, and 90 °C, seeking a dry product with high-quality retention. Based on five empirical models, drying kinetics, diffusion coefficient, and activation energy were analyzed. Midilli-Kuck was the best predicting model. Short drying times (55-270 min) were needed to reach 0.10 g water/g solid. In addition, the technique yielded samples with high rehydration capacity (24-29 g water/g solid); high retention of color (Delta E, 3.74-4.39); relatively low losses of vitamin C (37-59%) and vitamin E (28-37%). Regardless of the condition of temperature and sample thickness, a high-quality dried Aloe vera gel could be obtained. Compared with other methods, Refractance Window drying of Aloe vera achieved shorter drying times with higher quality retention in terms of color, vitamins C and E, and rehydration. Finally, the dried Aloe vera gel could be reconstituted to a gel close to its fresh state by rehydration. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Microbial load and antibiotic resistance of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus isolated from ready-to-eat (rte) khebab sold on a university campus and its environs in Ghana.		Journal of Food Quality					The demand for ready-to-eat (RTE) foods is handy to busy urban dwellers. Handling, processing, and selling are known to contaminate these foods and cause foodborne outbreaks. This study assessed a load of S. aureus and E. coli in khebabs (beef, chevon, and gizzard) sold on the KNUST campus and its environs and how resistant they are to clinically relevant antimicrobial agents. Thirty-six (36) khebab samples were purchased from vendors at Kotei, Ayeduase, Kentinkrono, Boadi, KNUST campus, and Ayigya. They were analyzed for S. aureus and E. coli and their resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobial agents checked using standard methods. S. aureus and E. coli load ranged from 4.09 to 5.96CFU/g and 1.79 to 6.12 MPN/g in beef, 4.02 to 6.01CFU/g and 1.99 to 4.44MPN/g in chevon, and 5.37 to 6.18CFU/g and 1.79 to 6.10MPN/g in gizzard khebabs in the different locations. E. coli (n=27) were multiresistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, gentamicin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and cotrimoxazole (51.85%) and susceptible to chloramphenicol (100%). S. aureus (n=36) isolates were multiresistant to penicillin, tetracycline, flucloxacillin, cefuroxime, ampicillin (97.22%), erythromycin (75%), cotrimoxazole (86.11%), and gentamicin (69.44%). It can therefore be concluded that the majority of khebabs from the KNUST campus and its environs were contaminated with S. aureus and E. coli above the acceptable standard limits (≤4 log10CFU/g and <2 log10MPN/g, respectively). Also, the S. aureus and E. coli isolated were multiresistant to the antibiotics tested and could be a medium for the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and therefore expose consumers to a high risk of contracting foodborne infections with drug-resistant strains.

Ensafi							Magnetic and gold nanocomposite as a novel aptasensor for early detection of tetracycline residues.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Tetracycline (TET) is one of the most conventional antibiotics with a widespread application in veterinary medicine and livestock like mastitis. Detection of this antibiotic in milk is far important because its presence reduces the dairy products and also can increase the antibiotic resistance in human body. In current study, an electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor was designed for TET residues detection as a sensitive, selective, and rapid way based on a pencil graphite electrode (PGE) using magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and gold nanoparticles (GNP) composite. The linear concentration range and detection limit values of the aptasensor was obtained as 1.0 pM to 1.0 muM, and 0.03 pM toward TET, which is lower than the value determined as allowable by the European Union (225 nM). A high selectivity for TET was shown by aptasensor over the other antibiotics including Sulfadiazine, Ampicillin, Penicillin G, and Streptomycin. The results of the TET-spiked in milk samples suggested reasonable recoveries between 92 and 102%. As a result, 90 min was the optimization time for aptasensor response. The relative standard deviation (RSD) was obtained as 5.9%, indicating an acceptable reproducibility for the aptasensor. The obtained results showed that the fabricated aptasensor is an effective, selective, and rapid assay for TET detection in milk and food quality control. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	4	3387	3396	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00917-7					FSTA:2021-12-Pe6885
J		Ayat Mohammad-Razdari; Rahim Ebrahimi; Mohammad Zarein; Mandana Mahfeli; Hoda Yoosefian, S.							Investigation of 60Co gamma irradiation on dehydration kinetics: a case study of apple slices.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Little research has been done on the effects of irradiation on dehydration kinetics of dried fruit in recent decades. Hot air drying is a convenience method frequently used for dehydration and moisture removal in products, such as fruits and vegetables. However, there are some disadvantages to using hot air dryers that often lead to the production of dried products with inferior quality due to its low drying efficiency. The present research aims to investigate the hot air dryer performance and presents a new strategy to improve dried bio-products quality using gamma irradiation as a drying pretreatment. The effects of irradiation dosage (control, 0.5, 2, and 5kGy) and air temperature (50, 65, and 80 °C) on the dehydration rate, moisture ratio, activation energy, and diffusion coefficient of dried apple slices were investigated. The results showed that different dose 0.5, 2, and 5kg decreased moisture content average 35, 21, and 11%, respectively. Also, by decreasing dehydration temperature, moisture content decreased to 42, 31, and 25%, respectively. The effective diffusivity values at different temperatures increased by increasing the irradiation dosage (control, 0.5, 2, and 5kg increased to 12, 17, 29, and 43% respectively), and vice versa for the activation energy. Practical Applications. Irradiation is one of the few food technologies that can maintain food quality and address food safety and security problems without significantly affecting a food's sensory or nutritional attributes. The destructive effect of60Co gamma-ray irradiation on interior tissue of some fruit and vegetables may change product structure to some extent. These kinds of structural changes can affect the drying kinetics, dehydration rate, moisture ratio, activation energy, and diffusion coefficient. Therefore, the investigation of hot-air drying kinetics of apple slices pretreated by60Co gamma-ray was required to improve the product quality. Additionally, it can cause a reduction in drying quality and improve the product characteristics during the drying process. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	6			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13697					FSTA:2021-10-Je12907

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Origanum haussknechtii Boiss. (Lamiaceae), an endemic herb growing in Turkey, is consumed as a tea in folk medicine. This study aimed to investigate antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities of the methanol, and water extracts from the aerial parts of O. haussknechtii, as well as to determine their phenolic profiles by using HPLC analysis. The methanol extract of O. haussknechtii displayed the highest antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli with an inhibition zone of 11.57 mm, and MIC of 100 g/mL. The methanol extract also exhibited an 80.53% inhibition effect on biofilm formation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In addition, the methanol extract showed cytotoxicity against the A549 cancer cell line with the growth inhibition of 47.7%. In the phenolic analysis, rosmarinic acid was detected to be a major compound in both methanol, and water extracts, with the amount of 43.17, and 17.68 mg/g extract, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first report on the antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and cytotoxic activities of O. haussknechtii, as well as the phenolic compositions using HPLC. Our data revealed that O. haussknechtii has the potential to be used in pharmaceutical, and cosmetic raw materials, as well as food supplements for application as novel bioactive agents. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aydar, A. Y.; Mataraci, C. E.; Saglam, T. B.							Development and modeling of a novel plant-based yoghurt produced by Jerusalem artichoke and almond milk using L-optimal mixture design.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The objective of this study was to optimize the almond milk and Jerusalem artichoke milk content to produce plant-based yoghurt high in total phenolic content, water holding capacity and overall acceptability. L-optimal mixture design was used for optimization of plant-based yoghurt produced by almond milk (AM) and Jerusalem artichoke milk (JAM). Lower L* values and titratable acidity were observed in plant-based yoghurts made from 75% Jerusalem artichoke milk and 25% almond milk compared to other yoghurts. Total phenolic contents and water holding capacity of plant-based yoghurts ranged from 49.68 to 61.78 mg GAE/100 g yoghurt and from 81.45 to 89.77%, respectively. The higher Jerusalem artichoke milk concentration in yogurt exhibited lower syneresis, higher water holding capacity and higher phenolic content. It was determined that the optimum concentration was 61.12% and 38.88% for Jerusalem artichoke milk and almond milk, respectively. The results of this study identified the key quality parameters of plant-based yoghurts made from different ratios of plant milks, that could play an important role in future plant-based product development. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aydemir, O.; Saricaoglu, F. T.; Atalar, A.							Dynamics of carob flour contents and palm stearin/palm olein ratios in cocoa carob cream production-a new product development.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					A new cocoa carob cream was developed and textural, rheological, and sensorial characteristics of the product were investigated. Three different carob flour (7.5%, 10%, and 12.5%) and palm stearin/palm olein mixture ratios (3.5/96.5%, 5/95%, and 6.5/93.5%) were used in laboratory-scale model manufacturing. The accelerated oil separation (AOS), water activity, spreadability and stickiness values in cocoa carob creams ranged from 6.27% to 12.80%, 0.274 to 0.309, 113 to 1, 122 gs, -77.5 to -436 gs, respectively. As the palm stearin content increased and palm olein content decreased, spreadability, stickiness, apparent viscosity, yield stress K′, K, G′, G, Aalpha values increased, however, AOS, Casson plastic viscosity and n′ and n values decreased. The palm oil mixture ratio had more effect on the characteristics of the cocoa carob cream than carob flour content. It is concluded that the most preferred cocoa carob cream by panelists has 10% carob flour and 5/95% palm stearin/palm olein ratio. Novelty impact statement. Cocoa carob cream has been developed as a new product. Cocoa carob creams were acceptable by panelists based on sensory evaluation. Ten percent carob flour and 5/95% palm stearin/palm olein ratio provided the best textural, rheological, and sensory results in the production of cocoa carob cream. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Chemistry					In this study, 3,3-bis (4-hydroxy-3-((E)-((4-hydroxyphenyl) imino) methyl) phenyl) isobenzofuran-1 (3H)-one (HMBP) was designed as a ""turn-on fluorogenic chemosensor to detect Al 3+. Studies were performed in C2H5OH-HEPES (v/v, 9/1, pH 7.0) media at lambdaem=475 nm. The LOD value was found to be 0.113 M. The stoichiometric ratio of HMBP-Al 3+ was determined as 1:2 by Job's plot and ESI-MS as well as 1H NMR titration. The binding constant of chemosensor HMBP with Al 3+ from the Benesi-Hildebrand equation was determined to be 1.21*10 8 M -1. The quantum (Phi) yields were obtained as 0.040 and 0.775 for the chemosensor HMBP and HMBP-Al 3+, respectively. The response of the chemosensor HMBP towards Al 3+ was attributed to the strategies of blocking the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) and CN isomerisation mechanisms. Finally, the sensing of the chemosensor HMBP for the determination of Al 3+ in real food samples, drinking waters and herbal teas, were employed. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Aydin, D.; Ozkan, K.; Aydin, A.							The combination of amygdalin with some anticancer, antiparasitic, and antigout drugs against MG63, Saos2, SW1353, and FL cells in vitro.		Journal of Medicinal Food					Osteosarcoma has a poor prognosis and survival rate due to inadequate chemotherapy, high recurrence ability, high metastasis potential, and almost no radiotherapy being applied. One of the strategies to solve these problems is to develop the pharmacologically active plant metabolite, amygdalin, in combination therapeutic systems. In this project, the antiproliferative effects of amygdalin alone and in binary or ternary combinations with some anticancer drugs (cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, and camptothecin), antiparasitic drugs (metronidazole and miltefosine), and an antigout drug (colchicine) were examined using human bone osteosarcoma cell lines (MG-63 and Saos2), the chondrosarcoma cell line (SW1353), and the normal human cell line (FL). Known half-maximal inhibitory concentration values of the drugs were taken into consideration, and the recommended combination ratios were used in the Chou-Talalay method. The strong synergistic effect commonly seen in the combination of amygdalin with miltefosine, metronidazole, camptothecin, colchicine, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin dual drug indicates that these combinations can be used in cancer treatment. The synergistic effect caused by amygdalin decreases toxicity by increasing drug yield. However, amygdalin antagonism seen in several combinations may prevent these pairs from being used together. In combination with antagonistic effects, it may be preferable to use amygdalin alone as it generally causes strong antiproliferative effects. Besides, there is a more potent synergism between amygdalin and triple drug combinations. Overall, these results emphasize that amygdalin combinations in treatment of bone cancer are significant.

J		Aydin, N.; Kian-Pour, N.; Toker, O. S.							Caramelized white chocolate: effects of production process on quality parameters.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The impact of different temperatures (110-120 °C) and times (30-120 min) on rheological properties, aroma components, color, browning index, and sensory characteristics of the caramelized white chocolate was examined. Ostwald de Waele model best fitted to flow behavior of the chocolates. The dependency of viscosity on temperature was modeled by the Arrhenius equation. After 90 min of caramelization at 115 °C and 120 °C, the consistency coefficient significantly increased and samples demonstrated doughy structure, with no desirable sensory properties due to the formation of solid particles. The formation of furfural and linalool increased by increasing the time and temperature of caramelization which demonstrated that at 120 °C, the caramelization time should not exceed 90 min otherwise, bitterness flavors, burned and bad taste were sensed. The most desirable samples according to sensory evaluation were at temperatures below 120 °C. Ultimately, the most appropriate process conditions were determined for 110 °C (60-90 min) and 115 °C/60 min. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Aydin, S.; Sayin, U.; Sezer, M. O.; Sayar, S.							Antioxidant efficiency of citrus peels on oxidative stability during repetitive deep-fat frying: evaluation with EPR and conventional methods.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Deep-fat frying process is a commonly used procedure for food preparation, and the oxidative stability is an important quality issue for frying oils. In this study, the effect of citrus peel extracts (orange, lemon, mandarin) and BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene; a synthetic antioxidant) on oxidative stability of sunflower oil during the deep-fat frying process was investigated. For this purpose; classic chemical wet methods (free fatty acid, peroxide, p-anisidine, conjugated dienes) and a spectroscopic method (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance [EPR] spectroscopy, spin trapping technique) were used. According to both chemical data and EPR spin trapping results, the antioxidant effects of citrus peel extracts were found to be comparable to BHT. Moreover, the antioxidant effect of lemon peel extract was higher than other citrus peel extracts. EPR spin trapping technique can be used as an earlier and more accurate detection method in determining lipid oxidation during repetitive deep-fat frying. Practical applications. Citrus peels, which are among the by-products of the fruit juice industry, have antioxidant properties. For this reason, citrus peels have the potential to improve the safety, quality, and nutritional value of industrial edible oils. In addition, waste can be reduced and value-added products can be produced by the utilization of citrus peels. EPR spectroscopy is the only technique in which lipid radicals, which are the most important indicators of lipid oxidation in industrial edible oils, can be directly and precisely defined. However, today mostly classical methods are used to measure oil quality. The more sensitive detection of oxidation in industrial edible oils may give us a clearer knowledge about the efficiency of the antioxidant source and the conditions under which they can be used. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Aydin Shekari; Naghshiband Hassani, R.; Soleimani Aghdam, M.; Mehdi Rezaee; Abbasali Jannatizadeh							The effects of melatonin treatment on cap browning and biochemical attributes of Agaricus bisporus during low temperature storage.		Food Chemistry					Exogenous melatonin application at 0, 1, 10, 100, and 1000 M retarded cap browning of button mushrooms (Agaricus bisporus) by 78.35, 31.40, 30.91, 27.17, and 32.50%, respectively. Mushrooms treated with 100 M melatonin also had lower weight loss and higher firmness. During the first 5 days of storage at 4 °C, higher H2O2 accumulation may serve as a signal for promoting endogenous melatonin accumulation by triggering the expression of TDC, T5H, SNAT, and ASMT genes, beneficial for preserving membrane integrity. Besides, the higher accumulation of phenols in mushrooms treated with 100 M melatonin may be ascribed to higher PAL and lower PPO gene expression and enzyme activity. Moreover, higher DPPH scavenging capacity in mushrooms treated with 100 M melatonin may be ascribed to the higher accumulation of phenols and ascorbic acid.

J		Aydin Shekari; Naghshiband Hassani, R.; Soleimani Aghdam, M.							Exogenous application of GABA retards cap browning in Agaricus bisporus and its possible mechanism.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					In this study, the effect of exogenous gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at 0 (control), 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mM on cap browning and quality of button mushrooms during 15 d of storage at 4 °C was investigated. GABA at 0.1 mM yielded the lowest cap browning. Weight loss, electrolyte leakage, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were significantly lower in mushrooms treated with 0.1 mM GABA, while their firmness was higher. The increased accumulation of total phenolic compounds in the 0.1 mM GABA treated mushrooms was associated with a higher expression and activity of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) accompanied by a lower expression and activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO). GABA treatment was capable of reducing H2O2 content and increasing ascorbic acid (AsA) content. Exogenous GABA increased the endogenous GABA content by increasing the expression of the glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) gene and decreasing the expression of the GABA transaminase (GABA-T) gene. Overall, GABA treatment could be employed for retarding cap browning and maintaining the sensory and nutritional quality of button mushrooms during cold storage.

International Dairy Journal					Reconstituted milk protein concentrate (MPC; 80% protein) was mixed with lactose (MPC-Lac) or milk permeate (MPC-Perm) to 20% dry matter (DM) before been evaporated to 45% DM and subsequently spray dried. The pH of protein solutions, measured during evaporation from 20 to 45% DM at 50 °C, decreased from pH 6.64 to pH 6.53 and from 6.1 to 5.95 for MPC-Lac and MPC-Perm, respectively. The particle size and viscosity were greater in MPC-Perm than MPC-Lac solutions after evaporation. However, the heat stability of rehydrated MPC-Perm powder (3.5% protein) were significantly higher than MPC-Lac at pH values between 6.4 and 6.8, which may be attributed to the lower calcium ion concentration in MPC-Perm than in MPC-Lac. This study highlighted the complexity of mineral addition and phase distribution in protein-standardised milk systems; whereby higher levels of mineral addition contribute to viscosity and age thickening, but not necessarily lower heat stability.

Journal of Food Quality					The world population is expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, which will require an increase in agricultural and food production by 70% to fit the need, a serious challenge for the agri-food industry. Such requirement, in a context of resources scarcity, climate change, COVID-19 pandemic, and very harsh socioeconomic conjecture, is difficult to fulfill without the intervention of computational tools and forecasting strategy. Hereby, we report the importance of artificial intelligence and machine learning as a predictive multidisciplinary approach integration to improve the food and agriculture sector, yet with some limitations that should be considered by stakeholders.

J		Ayele, H. H.; Latif, S.; Bruins, M. E.; Muller, J.							Partitioning of proteins and anti-nutrients in cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) leaf processing fractions after mechanical extraction and ultrafiltration.		Foods					Cassava plays a major role in improving food security and reducing malnutrition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of mechanical pressing coupled with ultrafiltration (UF) on the quality of different fractions of cassava leaves. Cassava leaves harvested from the greenhouse at the University of Hohenheim were passed through a mechanical screw press to extract the juice and separate the press cake. The juice was centrifuged and filtered to separate the sediment and clear supernatant. The clear supernatant was filtered using a 10 kDa UF system. The nutritional contents of the different fractions were analyzed at each processing step. The total phenolic content was significantly lower in the press cake that had a higher fiber and ash content. The juice and sediment fractions had higher crude protein and total phenolic content. Processing did not negatively affect the concentrations of essential amino acids except for tryptophan in the juice fraction. Non-protein nitrogen was mainly present in the UF permeate, illustrating the potential of UF for upgrading soluble protein fractions. The results indicated that the different fractions during processing could be a possible source of protein for food, feed (juice, sediment, and retentate), or fiber (press cake) for ruminant feed. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Ayeni, A.							Nutrient content of micro/baby-green and field-grown mature foliage of tropical spinach (Amaranthus sp.) and roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.).		Foods					Micro/baby-greens are gaining popularity in human diets as functional foods that deliver superior nutritional values and health benefits to consumers. This study conducted multiple times between 2017 and 2019 under greenhouse conditions and in the field at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA, showed that micro/baby-greens from tropical spinach (Amaranthus sp.) and roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) are rich in digestible carbohydrates, digestible protein, and dietary fiber. On dry weight basis, both vegetables have high relative percentages of P, K, and Mg; and relatively high ppm Fe, Mn, and Zn. Foliage tissues of both species are relatively low in total fat, Ca, and Cu. Between 10 and 20 days after sowing (DAS), percent digestible carbohydrates in fresh foliar tissue increased 100% in tropical spinach and 50% in roselle, while digestible protein dropped 21% in tropical spinach and 50% in roselle. Compared to field grown mature foliage, greenhouse-grown micro/baby-greens were lower in digestible carbohydrates and Ca but higher in digestible protein, P, K, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn. © 2021 by the authors.

Souza, F. d'						Selective impedimetric chemosensing of carcinogenic heterocyclic aromatic amine in pork by dsDNA-mimicking molecularly imprinted polymer film-coated electrodes.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Inspired by the easy intercalation of quinoxaline heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs) in double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), we synthesized a nucleobase-functionalized molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) as the recognition unit of an impedimetric chemosensor for the selective determination of a 2-amino-3,7,8-trimethyl-3H-imidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (7,8-DiMeIQx) HAA. HAAs are generated in meat and fish processed at high temperatures. They are considered to be potent hazardous carcinogens. The MIP film was prepared by potentiodynamic electropolymerization of a pre-polymerization complex of two adenine- and one thymine-substituted bis(2,2′-bithien-5-yl)methane functional monomer molecules with one 7,8-DiMeIQx template molecule, in the presence of the 2,4,5,2′,4′,5′-hexa(thiophene-2-yl)-3,3′-bithiophene cross-linking monomer, in solution. The as-formed MIP chemosensor allowed for the selective impedimetric determination of 7,8-DiMeIQx in the 47 to 400 muM linear dynamic concentration range with a limit of detection of 15.5 muM. The chemosensor was successfully applied for 7,8-DiMeIQx determination in the pork meat extract as a proof of concept.

J		Ayesha Ikram; Muhammad Nadeem; Muhammad Imran							Impact of vitamin A supplementation on composition, lipolysis, stability, and sensory of refrigerated stored Cheddar cheese.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					In the present investigation, cheese milk was supplemented with vitamin A (retinol palmitate) at four different concentrations, i.e., 3,500, 4,000, 4,500, and 5,000 IU (T1, T2, T3, and T4), respectively. Treatment without supplementation of vitamin A was used as control. Prepared Cheddar cheese samples were stored at 4 °C and further analyzed for vitamin A, organic acids, and fatty acids composition at different stages of ripening using high performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Supplementation of vitamin A at all concentrations showed no significant effect on moisture, fat and protein contents of Cheddar cheese. After salting, recovery of vitamin A in control, T1, T2, T3, and T4 was 91.98%, 91.60%, 91.47%, 91.92%, and 91.56%, respectively. Storage period of 90 days significantly affected the fatty acids composition in control and all experimental samples. No significant difference was recorded in free fatty acids, peroxide value, and sensory characteristics in 90-day-old cheese samples. Practical applications. Effect of vitamin A supplementation on retention and stability of Cheddar cheese was first time investigated. These results suggest that vitamin A supplemented Cheddar cheese may be prepared by supplementing the cheese milk from 3,500 to 5,000 IU retinol palmitate with acceptable sensory properties. In modern world, the Cheddar cheese prepared with vitamin A supplementation may have huge market and can be widely used in many countries worldwide as indispensable part of wide range of fast foods and also a part of daily meals in some regions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15651					FSTA:2021-11-Pj5791

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Inappropriate use of pesticides and unhygienic supply chains contaminate fresh fruit and vegetables with health-hazardous micro-organisms and chemical residues. Here, combined efficacy of aqueous ozone and ultrasound to disinfect and decontaminate strawberry fruits from food-borne microbial pathogen and pesticide residues was evaluated. Strawberry fruits were exposed to either ozone (flow rate≥3.3 mg min-1 for 125 g strawberry L-1 water) or ultrasound (40 kHz at 100 W) for 3,6 and 9 min. Treatment of strawberry fruits with either ozone or ultrasound for 3 min effectively reduced bacterial survival by 44-fold and 17-fold, respectively, compared to control. Then, strawberry fruits were simultaneously treated with both ozone and ultrasound for 1,2 or 3 min and stored at 20.5 °C and 95% relative humidity for 12 days. Ozone and ultrasound treatment for 3 min was most effective in reducing bacterial survival (98%) and residues of various pesticides (98-99%) compared to control. Strawberry fruits treated with ozone and ultrasound for 3 min exhibited delay in fungal decay by 4 days and 4% reduction in weight loss during cold storage for 12 days. Also, gradual decline in total soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, ascorbic acid and anthocyanins in cold-stored strawberry fruits was also hindered. Ozone and ultrasound treatment for 3 min also restrained 62% higher catalase, 52% higher peroxidase, and 70% higher superoxide dismutase in strawberry tissues compared to control after 12 days in cold storage. Thus, combined treatment of ozone and ultrasound for 3 min increased marketable life of strawberry fruits for 6 more days under cold storage conditions. Overall, results revealed a positive effect of ozone and ultrasound on disinfecting and decontaminating strawberry fruits along with extending their marketable life under cold storage conditions. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1437	1451	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00735-3					FSTA:2021-10-Jf13767
J		Ayesha Maryam; Raheel Anwar; Ullah Malik, A.; Aleem Khan, S.							Influence of macro-perforated polyethylene terephthalate and low-density polyethylene packaging films on quality and storability of strawberries.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Perishable nature of strawberry poses serious challenges in maintaining quality and extending its market life. In this study, efficacy of macro-perforated polyethylene terephthalate polyester (PET), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and composite film packaging (PET+ LDPE) was evaluated to inhibit fungal decay and retain nutritional and organoleptic attributes of strawberries stored at 20.5 °C. Strawberries packed in LPDE exhibited better moisture retention, least fungal infection, and delayed loss of membrane permeability compared to PET+ LDPE and PET. The LDPE film was also more effective in delaying increase in pH and total soluble solids and decline in fruit dry weight, titratable acids, ascorbic acid, and organoleptic acceptability. Overall, marketable life of strawberries packed in LDPE film was 2-and 1.5-fold higher than strawberries packed in either PET or LDPE+ PET, respectively. Higher levels of antioxidant enzymes catalase, superoxide-dismutase, and peroxidase in LDPE-packed strawberries suggest that LDPE retained strawberry quality was partly through maintaining ROS-scavenging mechanism in fruits. Practical applications. Low-density polyethylene film effectively preserves physical and biochemical properties of fresh strawberry fruit and extends its storability under low temperature conditions, an important aspect for long-distance local marketing and export. Findings of this research can be translated to other highly perishable crops and, with basic research support, local packaging industry can be involved to manufacture commodity-specific flexible film packaging. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15068					FSTA:2021-06-Jf7881

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The commercially important edible crab species from Pakistani waters are Portunus pelagicus, Portunus sanguinolentus, Scylla serrata and Charybdis feriatus. The present study has been designed to investigate the nutritional composition of edible crab species including proximate composition, vitamins, minerals and amino acids content. Among all the species, fat content were found at low levels (0.25%-1.86%), however, the protein content was higher in hard shell crab (S. serrata), i.e. 23.3%, than those in soft shell crabs (P. Pelagicus, P. sanguinolentus and C. feriatus), 16.4%, 14.2% and 15.1%, respectively. Energy value was high in S. serrata (107 kcals/100 g) whereas C. feriatus recorded the lowest value (65.5 kcals/100 g). In terms of amino acid profiling a total of eighteen amino acids were detected from which arginine (19.0 mg/100 g in S. serrata and 9.98 mg/100 g in P. sanguinolentus) and lysine (0.15-6.53 mg/100 g) have shown the highest values with variations in all crab samples. Of the seven minerals examined, calcium was the highest ranging between 292 ppm and 513 ppm followed by zinc (15.7 ppm-47.4 ppm) in all four crab species. Among the vitamins, niacin (Vit B3) recorded the highest value ranging between 16.9 mg/100 g and 49.2 mg/100 g followed by thiamine (Vit B1) and ascorbic acid (Vit C) in all crab samples. The results showed that the crabs contained appreciable amounts of nutrients. The present study findings revealed that the mud crab S. serrata has higher values of nutrients in terms of protein, amino acids, vitamins and minerals than other species.

Drying kinetics and effect of drying conditions on selected physicochemical properties of foam from yellow-fleshed and white-fleshed cassava (Manihot esculenta) varieties.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Fresh cassava is highly susceptible to rapid post-harvest physiological deterioration due to the high water activity. Therefore, foam mat drying was considered as an alternative drying technique for preservation. The drying kinetics of white-fleshed cassava foam (air volume fraction=0.26, overrun=36.0%) and yellow-fleshed cassava foam (air volume fraction=0.24, overrun=32.2%) were studied. The influence of temperature and foam thickness on moisture removal ratio (MR), drying rate, diffusivity and some important physicochemical properties of the cassava foams (CSF) during drying were researched and compared with those of non-foamed cassava pulp (NFP). The cassava foams were dried to foam powders at temperatures of 50 °C, 65 °C and 80 °C and foam thicknesses of 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The CSF exhibited two falling rates. The CSF powders had significantly lower total cyanogenic glucosides content compared to the NFP powder, and a high retention of total carotenoids. The dry foam powders had higher lightness/luminosity (L*) values than dry pulp powders. Micrographs revealed interactions between starch granules and the hydrocolloids but microstructure was not affected by increasing temperatures. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ayhan, N. K.; Rosenberg, E.							Development of comprehensive liquid chromatography with diode array and mass spectrometric detection for the characterization of (poly-)phenolic and flavonoid compounds and application to asparagus.		Food Chemistry					The main objective of the present work was to develop a method for the simultaneous and comprehensive analysis of (poly-)phenolic and flavonoid compounds with liquid chromatography with diode array and mass spectrometric detection and its application to green asparagus samples. To this end, a representative set of polyphenols was used to develop the method. A through method validation was carried out with these. The method was applied to asparagus samples known as a healthy vegetable being rich in bioactive compounds. Polyphenol contents of asparagus samples were determined by carrying out quantitative and qualitative analyses by LC-DAD-ESI/MS. In this context asparagus sample extracts were obtained using solvents of different polarity. The results were evaluated statistically and showed that rutin is the major phenolic compound in asparagus. This demonstrates the versatility of this rapid and sensitive method for the simultaneous analysis of (poly-)phenolic and flavonoid compounds which was successfully applied to asparagus samples.

J		Ayhan, N. K.							Investigation of antioxidant properties of chamomile consumed as herbal tea.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Common chamomile is consumed as herbal tea due to its antioxidant properties and biological activities in daily life. In this study, antioxidant activities and total phenolic contents of white and yellow chamomiles were investigated in terms of extraction methods and solvent types. In all extraction methods used for extraction of both chamomiles, the best antioxidant activity and total phenolic results were obtained with water extracts. Also, the best yield was found with sonication-assisted stirring for both chamomile extracts obtained using three extraction solvents. DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities obtained by sonication-assisted stirring for water extracts were 10.8860.244 mg TEAC/g and 8.7020.567 mg TEAC/g for white chamomile, and 11.7090.693 mg TEAC/g and 11.1390.514 mg TEAC/g for yellow chamomile. The total phenolic contents were determined as 3.8630.325 mg GAE/g for white chamomile and 5.2250.417 mg GAE/g for yellow chamomile. Novelty impact statement. In this study, the antioxidant properties of white and yellow chamomile were examined in detail in terms of different extraction methods and solvent types. Sonication-assisted stirring and water were determined to be the best extraction method and solvent for both chamomiles. According to the results, it can be stated that chamomile has higher antioxidant properties than white chamomile under the best extraction conditions. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15327					FSTA:2021-06-Hn6246
J		Aykas, D. P.; Menevseog, A.							A rapid method to detect green pea and peanut adulteration in pistachio by using portable FT-MIR and FT-NIR spectroscopy combined with chemometrics.		Food Control					In this research, the determination of green pea and peanut adulteration in pistachio by portable Fourier transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) and Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) spectroscopy was studied. A rapid method to detect adulteration in pistachio is a necessity in the food industry because of its high commodity value and being one of the most consumed tree nuts. Pistachio nut is a target for economically motivated adulteration, and green pea, spinach, and peanut are the most seen adulterants in pistachio. Portable FT-MIR and FT-NIR spectrometers are simple, non-invasive, rapid, easy to transport, and cheaper alternatives to traditional methods, including chromatography (GC, HPLC), mass-spectroscopy (GC-MS, LC-MS) for the detection of pistachio adulteration. Powdered pistachio samples were adulterated with powdered green pea and peanut samples at different concentrations (5-40%). Spectra were collected with a portable FT-MIR and FT-NIR spectrometers and analyzed by Soft Independent Modeling of Class Analogy (SIMCA) to generate a classification model to authenticate pure pistachio, and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) to predict the levels of adulterants in pistachio. SIMCA provided, in both units, very distinct clusters for pure and adulterated samples with inter-class distance (ICD) over 3. Both units also showed superior performance in predicting adulterant levels with rVal>0.99, standard error of prediction (SEP) < 2.5%. Based on SIMCA and PLSR models, portable FT-NIR spectrometer provided more advantages over portable FT-MIR unit because the prediction with the FT-NIR spectrometer was more precise than the FT-MIR unit. Both portable FT-MIR and FT-NIR units can be used as alternative methods to traditional methods and showed great potential for real-time surveillance to detect green pea and peanut adulteration in pistachio.

J		Aykin-Dincer, E.; Ozdemir, M.; Topuz, A.							Quality characteristics of bone broth powder obtained through Refractance Window drying.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this study was to produce bone broth powder with maximum efficiency and quality through Refractance Window (RW) drying. Concentrated bone broth samples were dried at different water temperatures (50,70 and 90 °C) and sample thicknesses (0.5 and 1 mm) and the quality properties of the obtained powders were compared with those of freeze-dried powder. The thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) value was higher in RW-dried powders and increased from 44.92 mumol MDA/kg to 61.13 mumol MDA/kg with the increase in the temperature. The solubility, bulk density and tapped density were also higher in RW-dried powders, and the parameters other than solubility increased with the increase in temperature, while they decreased with the increase in thickness. RW-dried powders had the lower turbidity value and L*, and higher a* and b* values indicating that these samples had a darker color and contained less undissolved particles. In addition, microbiological quality of powders increased as the temperature increased to 90 °C and as sample thickness decreased to 0.5 mm. Moreover, the sensory properties of the soups obtained from powders dried at 50-90 °C and 1 mm had higher scores.

J		Aykin-Dincer, E.							Application of ultrasound-assisted vacuum impregnation for improving the diffusion of salt in beef cubes.		Meat Science					The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different vacuum impregnation (VI) conditions (Control, VI-250, VI-500, VI-750, US-VI-250, US-VI-500 and US-VI-750) on the salt gain (SG) and water gain (WG) kinetics of beef cubes. The cubes were immersed in brine solution (4 g NaCl/ 100 g solution) and salted at different levels of vacuum (250, 500 and 750 mbar) using VI method with and without ultrasound. The final moisture and salt contents of the cubes were 78.60% and 1.59%, respectively, and the samples were salted the fastest with US-VI-250. Five kinetic models were selected to evaluate the SG and WG kinetics, and Azuara model exhibited the best fit. In addition, the salt (Ds) and moisture (Dw) diffusion coefficients were in the range of 5.94-8.11 * 10-9 m2/s and 5.17-8.64 * 10-9 m2/s, respectively. It can be concluded that the ultrasound-assisted VI could shorten the brining time by improving the salt diffusion in beef cubes. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Ayon Tarafdar; Pal Kaur, B.; Sunil Pareek							Effect of microfluidization on deteriorative enzymes, sugars, chlorophyll, and color of sugarcane juice.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Various enzymes are responsible for the quality and color degradation of sugarcane juice and need to be inactivated through suitable interventions. In this study, microfluidization of sugarcane juice was attempted over a pressure range of 50-200 MPa with 1-7 processing cycles to remediate the problem. The impact of microfluidization on the activity of polyphenol oxidase (PPO), peroxidase (POD), and sucrose neutral invertase (SNI) along with the sugar, color, and chlorophyll content of sugarcane juice was assessed. Results showed that microfluidization reduced the PPO activity by 39.4-64.7% and POD activity by 16.4-75.0%. However, SNI activity was restricted only at specific processing conditions. Reducing sugar increased with microfluidization but was found comparable to control, while total sugars decreased by 11-54%. Chlorophyll content increased up to 100 MPa pressure and showed no degradation at higher pressures. Juice color was relatively stable up to a pressure of 150 MPa with distinct high intensity of greenness. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the processed juice revealed that amide II band in the structure of PPO and POD was more susceptible to pressure treatment, while SNI can be more effectively reduced at 50 and 100 MPa. Genetic algorithm-based optimization showed 159 MPa pressure/1 cycle as suitable processing condition for maintaining the quality of sugarcane juice. Although microfluidization significantly reduced the activity of deteriorative enzymes in sugarcane juice while maintaining its color characteristics, complete inactivation could not be achieved which could hinder long-term preservation. In this regard, microfluidization-assisted technologies could be a future breakthrough for juice preservation. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	7	1375	1385	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02651-w					FSTA:2021-10-Lc1666
J		Ayon Tarafdar; Yogesh Kumar; Pal Kaur, B.; Prarabdh C. Badgujar							High-pressure microfluidization of sugarcane juice: effect on total phenols, total flavonoids, antioxidant activity, and microbiological quality.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Sugarcane juice is rich in bioactive compounds but is easily degraded during processing. Here, we observe the effect of microfluidization, an emerging high-pressure technique, on the phenols, flavonoids, antioxidants (by four assays), and microbiological safety of sugarcane juice. Results show a reduction of 30%-58% in phenols, 14%-54% in flavonoids, 24%-65% in ferric reducing antioxidant power, and 13%-64% in metal ion chelating activity of sugarcane juice. 2,2-diphenyl-1picryl hydrazil (DPPH) radical scavenging activity was unaffected after microfluidization, while hydroxyl radical scavenging activity increased by 31%-33% up to 100 MPa pressure. Sequential color palette analysis highlighted 100-150 MPa with three processing cycles as a suitable microfluidization conditions for sugarcane juice. However, sample processed at 150 MPa/3 cycles exhibited higher polyphenols and antioxidants in addition to being microbiologically safe. Variation in sugarcane juice parameters with microfluidization was found different from that of other food processing techniques perhaps due to its unique principle of operation. Practical applications. Bioactive components of sugarcane juice are very sensitive to processing and require adequate food processing interventions for retention. Thermal and certain nonthermal methods of processing are known to degrade the polyphenols of sugarcane juice thereby depleting its nutritional quality. Due to these constraints and the unavailability of suitable processing technique/condition, the commercialization of sugarcane juice becomes difficult. This work investigates an emerging nonthermal technique and its effect on sugarcane juice polyphenols and antioxidants. The efficiency of microfluidization in retention of these polyphenols has been quantified for potential industrial application of the technique for plant based extracts. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15428					FSTA:2021-09-Lc1502
J		Ayon Tarafdar; Pal Kaur, B.							Microfluidization-driven changes in some physicochemical characteristics, metal/mineral composition, and sensory attributes of sugarcane juice.		Journal of Food Quality					This work evaluated the effect of microfluidization at different pressure (50,100, 150, and 200MPa)-cycle (1,3, 5,7) combinations on the physicochemical (total soluble solids, titratable acidity, pH, and electrical conductivity), sensory, and metal/mineral composition of sugarcane juice which was previously unexplored. Juice extracted from blanched sugarcane stems (var Co 0238) was microfluidized, and the analysis for different parameters was conducted using standard protocols. The mineral/metal composition was determined using ICP-OES following a wet digestion method. Results showed that TSS decreased from 18.88 °Brix to a range of 10.15-15.7 °Brix with the former (lower value) being due to the release of insoluble matter after microfluidization which was further solubilised at higher processing cycles (as in the latter). The pH did not vary significantly as compared to control and was in the range of 5.2-5.7. However, a decrease in titratable acidity (0.1-0.26%) was found as compared to control (0.26%). The electrical conductivity of microfluidized sugarcane juice varied from 4.45 to 5.12mS as compared to 4.95mS for control. Metal/mineral analysis showed rich reserves of magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in sugarcane juice which degraded after microfluidization perhaps due to filtration effect caused by the micropore in the interaction chamber of the microfluidizer. The sensory score showed acceptability of the juice after microfluidization (overall acceptability ~7).

J		Ayon Tarafdar; Pal Kaur, B.							Sedimentation rate of microfluidized sugarcane juice.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sugarcane juice contains unstable particles that readily undergo agglomeration and sedimentation. In this work, microfluidization was used as a processing tool to generate a possible solution to the sedimentation problem in sugarcane juice for the first time. Stoke's law was used to determine the particle sedimentation rate. Experiments were devised to explore the majority of the pressure range of microfluidization (50-200 MPa) with variation in processing cycles (1-7). Particle size and apparent viscosity of sugarcane juice were determined. Microscopic analysis was also carried out to visualize the effect of microfluidization on the particles in the juice. Microfluidization in the pressure range of 50-150 MPa with less than 7 cycles of processing reduced the size of suspended juice particles successfully. Results revealed that 150 MPa pressure with 5 cycles was suitable for sugarcane juice processing as it generates the lowest particle size (~437 nm) and minimum particle sedimentation rate (4.91*10-2 mm/day).

Toxins					The present study investigated the dietary and urinary OTA occurrence among 44 Lebanese children. Relying on HPLC-FLD analysis, OTA was found in all the urine samples and in 46.5% and 25% of the 24 h duplicate diet and dinner samples, respectively. The means of OTA levels in positive samples were 0.32 0.1 ng/g in 24 h diet, 0.32 0.18 ng/g in dinner and 0.022 0.012 ng/mL in urines. These values corresponded to margin of exposure (MOE) means of 7907 5922 (neoplastic) and 2579 1932 (non-neoplastic) calculated from positive 24 h diet, while 961 599 (neoplastic) and 313 195 (non-neoplastic) calculated from the urine. Since the MOE levels for the neoplastic effect were below the limit (10,000), a major health threat was detected and must be addressed as a health institutions' priority. Besides, the wide difference between PDIs and MOEs calculated from food and urine suggests conducting further OTA's toxicokinetics studies before using urine to measure OTA exposure. © 2021 by the authors.

Changes in cell wall neutral sugar composition related to pectinolytic enzyme activities and intra-flesh textural property during ripening of ten apricot clones.		Food Chemistry					The changes of texture and cell wall characteristics of apricot were investigated in ten clones at two maturity stages. Fruit firmness, cell wall composition and enzyme activity of three apricot flesh zones were analysed. The AIS (alcohol-insoluble solids) were characterised by high amounts of uronic acid (179-300 mg g-1 AIS) and relatively high amounts of cellulosic glucose (118-214 mg g-1 AIS). The methylesterification degree varied significantly among the different clones ranging from 58 to 97 in Ab 5 and Mans 15 respectively. Conversely to zones firmness, enzymatic activity was higher in pistil followed by equatorial and peduncle zones. The ripening effect has been observed in firmness evolution according to enzymatic activity. This correlation allowed a classification of clones depending on softening. Among studied clones, Ab 5, Marouch 16, Mans 15 and Cg 2 were less influenced by softening and have the advantage of a technological valorisation for the processing industry.

Assessment of nutritional, technological, and commercial apricot quality criteria of the Moroccan cultivar "Maoui" compared to introduced Spanish cultivars "Canino" and "Delpatriarca" towards suitable valorization.		Journal of Food Quality					Apricot is among the most important fruits in Morocco. This study aimed to determine the main physical, physicochemical, and biochemical quality criteria of three principal apricot cultivars in Morocco, namely, "Maoui," "Canino," and "Delpatriarca." Different physicochemical and biochemical methods have been improved and adapted for the assessment of the apricot's quality. Fruit of "Canino" has shown a good organoleptic quality due to interesting biometrics, richness of carotenoids (up to 113.67mug of beta-carotene g-1 of fresh weight (FW)), and an important content of soluble solids (SS) that reached 17.20 °Bx. "Delpatriarca" is rich in organic acids (27.35g/kg FW for total acids) while "Maoui" has high water content (83.77%) and a SS content of 16.03 °Bx. The association of the total acidity and soluble solids determination with the use of the HPLC for determining the organic acids was very practical and effective in determining the organoleptic quality of the fruit. High correlations were detected between several attributes. In addition, an important relationship between total carotenoids concentration and color parameters (L*a*b*) demonstrated that these parameters are good for apricot quality and ripening indices. The obtained results also revealed the presence of a high variability among the quality criteria of the three apricot cultivars. These characteristics could be useful for promoting the consumption of the "Maoui" as fresh fruits and the use of "Canino" and "Delpatriarca" for industry derivatives products. The results could also be useful for new apricot breeding program among different eco-geographical groups of the Mediterranean region.

J		Ayranci, U. G.; Karaca, H.							Effect of in-package gas composition on growth and aflatoxin production of Aspergillus flavus in culture medium and red pepper.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					In this study, the effect of in-package gas composition on growth and aflatoxin production of toxigenic Aspergillus flavus was investigated. For this purpose, semi-dried red pepper samples and potato dextrose agar media with different pH values (3.5, 5.6, 7.0 and 9.0) were inoculated with A. flavus and packaged under different gas atmospheres (air, 100% N2, 70% N2 + 30% CO2 and 100% CO2). The growth of the fungus was monitored during storage at 25 °C for 8 days and the aflatoxin levels produced were determined at the end of storage. The highest growth rate was observed in the medium at pH 9.0 and the highest toxin production was in the medium at pH 5.6. Slowdowns up to 55.6% and 28.0% in the growth of A. flavus in the culture medium and red pepper were observed when packaging under 100% N2 was employed. It was found that 70% N2 + 30% CO2 atmosphere was more effective than 100% N2 in inhibiting the growth of A. flavus in red peppers; however, the difference between the aflatoxin levels produced in the samples packaged under these gas compositions was not significant (p> 0.05). CO2 concentrations higher than 90% in the package were quite effective against A. flavus resulting in 60% and 99% reductions in the growth and aflatoxin production of the fungus in red pepper.

J		Ayseli, M. T.; Kelebek, H.; Selli, S.							Elucidation of aroma-active compounds and chlorogenic acids of Turkish coffee brewed from medium and dark roasted Coffea arabica beans.		Food Chemistry					Turkish coffee is a popular hot beverage owing to its delicious taste and pleasant aroma in Turkey. In the present study, key odorants of medium (MRC) and dark roasted Turkish coffee (DRC) brews were studied using GC-MS-Olfactometry. A total of 26 and 28 key odorants were detected in the MRC and DRC samples, respectively, with flavour dilution (FD) factors varying between 4 and 2048. The highest FD factor (2048) was found for 2-ethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazine and 2-ethyl-3-methyl pyrazine in the MRC and DRC brew samples, respectively. One of the main differences between the two brew samples was the guaiacol with phenolic-burnt odour. A higher amount of chlorogenic acids (CGAs) was determined in the MRC as compared to the DRC using LC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS. According to the sensory analysis, the Turkish coffee sample brewed from the MRC beans had a higher score of general impression and pleasant coffee sensory descriptors as compared to the DRC.

Food Bioscience					Physicochemical properties, structural features, and biological activities of polysaccharide fractions isolated from Nitraria sibirica (NS) pall fruit were investigated. Structural characterization was carried out using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, gas chromatography, partial acid hydrolysis, peroxide oxidation, Smith degradation, and nuclear magnetic resonance. The results showed that three of the polysaccharide fractions with average molecular weights of 21.5, 14.4, and 49.4 kDa were composed of different molar ratios of rhamnose, galactose, glucose, mannose, and arabinose, and have different chain structures and glycosidic linkages. The structural characteristics of polysaccharide fractions were also evaluated by scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetric analysis. NSP-3 exhibited a better biological activity compared to NSP-1 and NSP-2, with IC50 value of anti- MCF-7 at 50.89 mug/mL, and inhibition rate against cyclooxygenase-2 was 85.60% at a concentration of 100 mug/mL. These results suggested that polysaccharides obtained from N. sibirica fruits could be a promising ingredient for health-beneficial functional foods.

J		Ayustaningwarno, F.; Fogliano, V.; Verkerk, R.; Dekker, M.							Surface color distribution analysis by computer vision compared to sensory testing: vacuum fried fruits as a case study.		Food Research International					Color is a main factor in the perception of food product quality. Food surfaces are often not homogenous at micro-, meso-, and macroscopic scales. This matrix can include a variety of colors that are subject to changes during food processing. These different colors can be analyzed to provides more information than the average color. The objective of this study was to compare color analysis techniques on their ability to differentiate samples, quantify heterogeneity, and flexibility. The included techniques are sensory testing, Hunterlab colorimeter, a commercial CVS (IRIS-Alphasoft), and the custom made CVS (Canon-CVS) in analyzing nine different vacuum fried fruits. Sensory testing was a straightforward method and able to describe color heterogeneity. However, the subjectivity of the panelist is a limitation. Hunterlab was easy and accurate to measure homogeneous samples with high differentiation, without the color distribution information. IRIS-Alphasoft was quick and easy for color distribution analysis, however the closed system is the limit. The Canon-CVS protocol was able to assess the color heterogeneity, able to discriminate samples and flexible. As a take home massage, objective color distribution analysis has a potential to unlock the limitation of traditional color analysis by providing more detailed color distribution information which is important with respect to overall product quality.

Currently, limited amounts of einkorn are produced within a few regions of Europe and the US, and therefore it is sold at higher prices than common wheat. Either for unfair economic gain (adulteration) or to compensate its weaker gluten structure, einkorn flour tends to be adulterated with bread wheat flour, which is frequently encountered in commercial einkorn flour or einkorn baked products. In this study, einkorn and bread wheat flours were initially analyzed for their common quality properties following the traditional analytical methods. Then, two rapid methods, Computer-Based Image (CBI) Analysis and Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), were evaluated to rapidly estimate the% level of bread wheat flour in both einkorn-wheat flour mixtures and the bread made of those mixtures. For this purpose, binary mixtures of einkorn flour and the adulterating bread wheat flour were prepared for calibration (46 samples) and external validation (18 samples) sets, with wheat flour content in the mixtures ranging between 5 and 95% (w/w). Then, for each binary mixture, a loaf of conventional bread was produced. Flour mixtures and loaves of bread samples produced were analyzed by both CBI and NIRS. Our results suggested that CBI could only yield high correlation levels between the wheat flour content and some color properties in bread samples (>0.96), while no sufficient correlations were observed in flour mixtures. Regarding the NIRS, highly accurate models were developed for both flour mixtures (correlation coefficients > 0.99, standard errors < 1.39% and RPD level of 19.3) and bread samples (correlation coefficients > 0.94, standard errors < 2.64% and RPD level of 10.1). Our results indicate that both NIRS and CBI may be implemented in the rapid and easy screening of wheat flour adulteration in einkorn bread, while only NIRS is suggested to be used for the same purpose in flour mixtures.

J		Azadeh Asadzadeh; Hossein Jalali; Hossein Azizi, M.; Mohammadi Nafchi, A.							Production of oat bran functional probiotic beverage using Bifidobacterium lactis.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					A non-dairy probiotic beverage based on oat bran extract was produced through fermentation of beverage using a probiotic strain Bifidobacterium lactis. Physicochemical characteristics, viability of probiotic bacteria, and sensory specification were investigated during three weeks of refrigerated storage with various concentration of oat bran extract and carbon dioxide in grape flavor beverage. It was observed that the acidity of the beverage samples significantly increased by increasing the percentage of oat bran extract and carbon dioxide, while the Brix decreased during storage and reached the lowest value after 21 days. The viability of the bacteria was significantly enhanced by increasing the amount of carbon dioxide and oat bran extract concentration until the 14th day after fermentation. The viability extremely decreased with increasing the storage time to 21 days. Oat bran is a rich source of nutrients including carbohydrates, protein, minerals, vitamins and soluble beta-glucan. The use of oat bran as a profitable substrate to produce a non-dairy grape flavor probiotic beverage was examined. Due to high viability of the Bifidobacterium lactis after two weeks of storage at 4 °C, the formulation was characterized with 15% (w/v) oat bran extract and 1% carbon dioxide. The highest sensory score was obtained by 15% (w/v) oat bran extract and 0.5% carbon dioxide sample. Therefore, incorporation of the oat bran in formulated grape flavor probiotic could enhance the nutritional value of the beverage. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1301	1309	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00726-4					FSTA:2021-10-Hs9517

Prevention of decay and maintenance of bioactive compounds in strawberry by application of UV-C and essential oils.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The present study investigated the impact of exposing strawberry fruits against UV-C intensity, besides basil and eucalyptus essential oils (EOs) with 40 L on phytochemical content of the strawberry fruit. After treatment, fruits were transferred to 4°C and the quality parameters comprising weight loss, firmness, antioxidant capacity, total phenolics, ascorbic acid, anthocyanins, titratable acidity, total soluble solids, and decay index were assessed after 1, 4, 8 and 12 days of cold storage. Results. Showed that all the factors were affected by the applied treatments, as well as the storage duration. The highest levels of firmness were found in BEO (2.47 N) and UV-C (2.44 N) treated fruits without significant difference. At the end of storage, the highest total phenol content (198.21mg GAE L-1) and antioxidant activity (3.51mmol Fe II g-1 FW) were found in fruits treated with UV-C radiation, as well as l-ascorbic acid content (33.0mg ascorbic acid/100g FW) compared to the control group. The highest and lowest decays were recorded in control fruits (80%) and those treated with basil essential oils (43.3%), respectively. Applying UV-C radiation and volatile oils in vapor phase could improve the quality properties of treated strawberry fruits by increasing antioxidant activity due to the preservation of phenolic compounds. Further investigations are required to introduce the most convenient, optimized, and effective methods for increasing the strawberry fruits storage time. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	6	5310	5317	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-01095-2					FSTA:2022-07-Jf9657

M.; Elhadi Yahia							Shelf-life extension of pomegranate arils using chitosan nanoparticles loaded with Satureja hortensis essential oil.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. This study was conducted in two parts to improve the antimicrobial activity and stability of Satureja hortensis essential oil (SEO) and its impacts on the quality of pomegranate arils. In the first part, SEO was encapsulated by an ionic gelation technique into 142.2-267.7 nm chitosan nanoparticles (CSNPs). In the second part of the experiment, the CSNPs and CSNPs-SEO were applied to improve storability of pomegranate arils. Arils were dipped in water (control), CSNPs and CSNPs-SEO for 5 min. After superficial water removal, arils were packed into polystyrene boxes and stored at 5 °C for 18days. Results. Based on spectrophotometry analysis, the encapsulation efficiency (EE) of SEO-loaded CSNPs (CSNPs-SEO) decreased from 26.57% to 7.41% and their loading capacity (LC) increased from 4.72% to 6.17%, respectively, upon increasing the initial SEO content from 0.125 to 0.5 gg-1 of chitosan. Phytochemicals and water content were maintained, and microbial counts were reduced in the coated arils during storage. Total phenol and antioxidant activity decreased during storage. At the end of storage, the highest total phenol content (2980.0 mg gallic acid equivalents L-1) was found in arils treated with CSNPs-SEO, whereas ascorbic acid content was maximal (6.32mgL-1) in arils treated with CSNPs. The encapsulation of savory essential oil in chitosan nanoparticles did not have undesirable effects in pomegranate arils. Conclusion. Pre-storage treatment of pomegranate arils with CSNPs-SEO could be considered a beneficial treatment to better maintain the biochemical and sensorial quality during storage. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	9	3778	3786	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11010					FSTA:2021-10-Jg12940

New sensitive methods for fraud detection in buffalo dairy products.		International Dairy Journal					The rising consumption of buffalo milk derivatives in recent years has highlighted the search for buffaloes in Brazilian livestock farming. These products have greater added value compared with common dairy milk products. Consequently, addition of variable amounts of cows' milk during manufacture of buffalo dairy products may occur, which constitutes fraud by product adulteration. Thus, the present study developed and standardised a DNA extraction protocol for application on different dairy derivatives and two methods based on real-time PCR for fraud identification: high-resolution melting (HRM) and rhAmp SNP system. The extraction method allowed to extraction of DNA from eleven different dairy products. The sensitivity of the rhAmp method (1%) was five times higher than HRM assay (5%) and may be considered a better choice for identification of product adulteration when high sensitivity levels are required.

J		Azevedo, E. S. de; Norena, C. P. Z.							External ionic gelation as a tool for the encapsulation and stability of betacyanins from Bougainvillea glabra bracts extract in a food model.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					External ionic gelation was employed to encapsulate Bougainvillea glabra bracts extract with sodium alginate and inulin as wall materials. The inulin content increases from 10% to 20% (w/w) in the capsules, resulting in betacyanins encapsulation efficiencies of 79.28% and 89.01%, respectively. It increased the rupture strength from 12.44 to 40.24 N, respectively, and resulted in more compact and spherical capsules with higher thermal stability until 200°C. The betacyanins degradation kinetics was also studied using the capsules formulation with 20% (w/w) inulin into gummy candies as a food model during 35 days of storage. The betacyanins content in the gummy candies varied from 3.28 to 0.12 mg/g, with 3.66% of retention. Betacyanins degradation followed first-order kinetics (R2 = .995), with a reaction rate constant of 0.0942 days-1. The higher water activity of the gummy candies (0.954) was considered the main cause of betacyanins degradation. Novelty impact statement. A simple, economical, and environmentally friendly encapsulation method was employed to increase the stability of betacyanins from B. glabra bracts extract when incorporated as natural colorants in food formulations. Inulin was utilized as a filling material in the structures of the B. glabra bracts extract capsules, and the increase in this polymer content raised the betacyanins encapsulation efficiencies, the rupture strength, the thermal stability, and also contributed to the formation of compact and spherical capsules. With the use of gummy candies as a food model, it was possible to assess the encapsulated betacyanins degradation during storage when employed as natural colorants into food formulations. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15637					FSTA:2022-01-Tb0057

Rhamnolipids-based nanostructured lipid carriers: effect of lipid phase on physicochemical properties and stability.		Food Chemistry					In this work rhamnolipids were evaluated as surfactants for the production of nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). NLCs were produced by melt-emulsification using ultra-homogenisation followed by ultrasonication and different ratios of medium-chain-triglycerides and glycerol monostearate (lipid phase) were tested. NLCs presented sizes and polydispersity index values ranged between 97 and 120 nm and 0.20-0.26, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy observations confirmed the size and the spherical morphology of the NLCs. The thermal analysis and X-ray diffraction showed that the amount of solid lipid (glycerol monostearate) influences the melting, crystallisation and enthalpy of NLCs and their degree of crystallinity. Results showed that NLCs were more stable at 4 °C and the best formulation (1% of water phase, 0.05% of biosurfactant and solid: liquid ratio of 10:90) was stable for 30 days. This work showed the possibility of using rhamnolipids to produce NLCs and represent an important step for the development of lipid-based nanosystems using biosurfactants.

Food Chemistry					Olive anthracnose is caused by fungal species within the Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense complexes. Anthracnose causes severe pre-and post-harvest olive drupe fall. This study aimed to design a species-specific qPCR assay, based on klap1 gene, suitable for C. acutatum s.s. Quantification in cv. Galega Vulgar fruit samples. The developed qPCR assay presented a detection limit of 10.14fg/reaction, and a linear cycle threshold of R2=0.996. C. acutatum inoculum was detected in pulverized olive fruits, and in early infection stages, before symptom appearance, 16h after inoculation (Ct values=28.291.1). In olive samples, the derived melting curve was specific presenting a single dissociation peak (Tmelting=88.7 °C). The designed assay was effectively applied in C. acutatum detection and quantification using infected olive samples, with a LOD of 0.59ng and a LOQ of 1.8ng, allowing its application to orchard management.

Optimisation of alginate-pectin bead formulation using central composite design guided electrospray technique.		International Food Research Journal					Alginate-pectin beads act as a carrier in improving the oral bioavailability of bioactive compounds. Electrospray technique facilitates the production of uniform size and shape of alginate-pectin beads. Interaction between key electrospray process parameters affects the size and shape of the beads. A proper model should be employed to establish these correlating interactions. In the present work, the electrospray technique was guided with a central composite design (CCD) and response surface methodology (RSM). One quadratic and one linear model were obtained for size and sphericity coefficient, respectively. The CCD-RSM empirical model derived from the present work is essential to determine the significant factors and their levels in producing beads with consistent size and sphericity coefficient. The results indicated that the applied voltage had the most significant influence on size, while the alginate-pectin concentration was the most prominent factor in producing spherical beads. Spherical beads with a minimum size of 2.97 mm were obtained at an alginate-pectin concentration of 3.5%, a flow rate of 10.0 mL/h, an applied voltage of 2.4 kV, and a distance between the nozzle and the gelation bath of 16.0 cm.

Foods					The function of packaging is crucial in the maintenance of fresh meat product quality. This study aimed to assess the efficiency of six films added with coatings 2379L/220 and 2379L/221 (containing sage extracts) to inhibit Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, which showed that two of the six films had a significant effect. Additionally, the effects of the films on refrigerated skinless chicken breast meat were evaluated based on microbiological content, colour, weight loss, texture and pH. Four of the six films were examined could extend the storability of refrigerated chicken breast fillets for up to seven days. All six treated films improved the pH, colour stability, weight loss, and texture of the chicken fillets. Therefore, these findings suggested that the coatings containing sage extracts having different viscosities (2379L/220 and 2379L/221) were effective as antimicrobial adhesives in food packaging films and can be commercially applied in prolonging the storage of chicken breast meat without affecting their quality. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Azimi Mahalleh, A.; Parvin Sharayei; Elham Azarpazhooh							Investigating the characteristics of the Nepeta binaludensis encapsulated extract and its release kinetics in laboratory conditions.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					This study aimed to investigate the encapsulation of the Nepeta binaludensis extract and its release kinetics under laboratory conditions. The Nepeta extract (extracted using a pulse electric field process, 6000 v and pulse number 60) was encapsulated with maltodextrin (with dextrose equivalent of 7 (MD7) and 20 (MD20)) and Arabic gum (AG) with a mass ratio of 1:5 (extract/wall material, w/w). Response Surface Methodology (RSM) has been used to optimize the microencapsulation efficiency and the physicochemical properties of encapsulated powders, considering the type of wall content. To investigate the release kinetics under laboratory conditions, the microcapsules stored for 35 days at a relative humidity of 55 and 75% at 4 and 25 °C and every 7 days were measured the amount of microencapsulated phenolic compounds. The results showed that the combination of MD7 (16.67), AG (16.67), and MD20 (66.67) had higher efficiency in the production of microcapsules, total phenolic compounds, antioxidant power and glass transition temperature compared to other cases. These microcapsules were thin, uniform, non-porous, and indented in shape. The monitoring of release kinetics during storage showed that the loss of phenolic compounds was significantly affected by the type of wall composition, such that the wall with formula MD7 (16.67), AG (16.67), and MD20 (66.67), had a higher inhibitory effect on reducing total phenolic compounds compared to other walls. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	1	164	176	1935-5130				10.1007/s11947-020-02560-4					FSTA:2021-06-Aj9391

Food Science & Nutrition					Dracocephalum moldavica L. Is a significant component in the Iranian food basket. This study aimed to investigate the bioactive compounds and biological activities of different extracts obtained from D. moldavica aerial parts. From the aerial parts, a crude methanolic (MeOH) extract and its four sub-fractions, that is, petroleum ether (Pet), ethyl acetate (EtOAc), n-butanol (n-BuOH), and aqueous (water) extracts were obtained. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents as well as the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities of the extracts were determined. Moreover, the phytochemical profiles of the essential oil (EO) and of those extracts with the highest antioxidant activity measured by GC/MS and UPLC-PDA-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. Results showed that the highest concentrations of phenols and flavonoids as well as the most potent antioxidant potential according to the DPPH method were determined in the EtOAc and MeOH extracts with IC50 values of 22.0 and 34.4 g. Ml-1, respectively. Quantitative analysis of these extracts was subsequently performed by UPLC-PDA-ESI-QTOF-MS/MS. Both extracts contained mainly rosmarinic acid, caffeic acid, and 2-hydroxycinnamic acid, which may be responsible for their high antioxidant activity. Moreover, none of the extracts showed cytotoxic effects against MCF7, SW48, and a normal cell line of mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (NIH/3T3) in the tested concentrations (up to 400 mug. Ml-1). Additionally, GC-MS analysis showed that oxygenated monoterpenes (55.4%) were the main constituents of the EO of D. moldavica. © 2021 The Authors.

Sensitive and selective electrochemical detection of bisphenol A based on SBA-15 like Cu-PMO modified glassy carbon electrode.		Food Chemistry					This work reports the electrochemical detection of bisphenol A (BPA) using a novel and sensitive electrochemical sensor based on the Cu functionalized SBA-15 like periodic mesoporous organosilica-ionic liquid composite modified glassy carbon electrode (Cu@TU-PMO/IL/GCE). The structural morphology of Cu@TU-PMO is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET). The catalytic activity of the modified electrode toward oxidation of BPA was interrogated with cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) in phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) using the fabricated sensor. The electrochemical detection of the analyte was carried out at a neutral pH and the scan rate studies revealed that the sensor was stable. Under the optimal conditions, a linear range from 5.0nM to 2.0M and 4.0 to 500M for detecting BPA was observed with a detection limit of 1.5nM (S/N=3). The sensor was applied to detect BPA in tap and seawater samples, and the accuracy of the results was validated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The proposed method provides a powerful tool for the rapid and sensitive detection of BPA in environmental samples.

J		Aziz Habibi-Yangjeh; Mahdi Davari; Reza Manafi-Yeldagermani; Alikhah Asl, S.; Samira Enaiati; Asgar Ebadollahi; Solmaz Feizpoor							Antifungal activity of TiO2/AgBr nanocomposites on some phytopathogenic fungi.		Food Science & Nutrition					TiO2/AgBr composites were synthesized by a simple ultrasonic strategy. Various instruments such as SEM, EDX, XRD, and FT-IR were exploited to investigate their characteristics. Antifungal activities of the as-obtained samples were assessed through the inactivation of Fusarium graminearum in the spore suspension method and mycelial growth inhibition of F. graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in the microdilution method. The results represented that the TiO2/AgBr samples possess higher antifungal activities on F. graminearum spores than the pure TiO2. The sample with 20 wt% silver bromide represented the highest inhibitory effect on the growth of F. graminearum so that all fungal spores were degraded in the initial times of the treatment process. The inactivation of fungal spores after 60 min was 35.2%, 97.8%, 98.9%, and 98.7%, in respect, for 5, 10, 20, and 30 weight percent of AgBr in the binary nanocomposites, while the inhibition rate was 13.4% for the pure TiO2. With increasing ultrasound irradiation time for more than 30 min, the inactivation rate constant decreased. It was also found that the antifungal activity of the nanocomposites without calcination was higher than those of the calcined materials. Considering the antifungal potential against phytopathogenic fungi and advantages such as simple synthesis and eco-friendly nature, it seems that TiO2/AgBr nanocomposites can be used instead of synthetic chemicals after additional field investigations and mass production. © 2021 The Authors.

Pulsed electric field of goat milk: impact on Escherichia coli ATCC 8739 and vitamin constituents.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					There is a dire need to produce shelf-stable and safe goat milk with minimal effects on its nutritive quality. In this study, raw goat milk was processed with a continuous pulsed electric field (PEF) system, at various electric field strength (EFS: 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40kV/cm) and processing time (5, 7, 10, and 13mus). The maximum log reduction of Escherichia coli was 3.87 log CFU/ml, achieved at 40kV/cm for 13mus. Weibull and Peleg models were better fitted to the inactivation kinetics of E. coli ATCC 8739 as a function of processing time and EFS, respectively. The mean concentration of vitamin A (as beta-carotene) and B-group vitamins (thiamine, riboflavin, and niacin) were nonsignificantly (p> .05) decreased compared to the unprocessed sample. Since the inactivation level did not reach the minimum log reduction recommended by USFDA, PEF is recommended as a complementary method to mild thermal pasteurization. Practical Applications. PEF processing has gained recognition in food processing through halting an adverse issue of thermal processing. Although PEF is drifting toward industrial practice, it is essential to verify the efficiency of PEF in a complex matrix like goat milk to assure PEF can be utilized for industrial use. The results of this study show that the PEF can be recommended as a complementary method to mild thermal pasteurization as a hurdle processing technique to ensure the safety and nutritive qualities of goat milk at the industry level. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	9			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13779					FSTA:2021-12-Pe6887
J		Azizian, H.; Dugan, M. E. R.; Kramer, J. K. G.							Clarifications of the carbonyl and water absorptions in fourier transform near infrared spectra from extra virgin olive oil.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					The Fourier transform near infrared (FT-NIR) spectrum of extra virgin olive oils (EVOO) shows two minor carbonyl absorptions at 5280 and 5180 cm-1 that has been used to assess their authenticity. To establish components absorbing at 5280 cm-1, volatile aldehydes and ketones, triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerols (DAG), free fatty acids (FFA), phenolics, and water are investigated and sometimes added to refined olive oil (ROO). Except TAG, the remaining carbonyls contribute to 5280 cm-1 by broadening peak. Water absorption is demonstrated by its removal using Na2SO4 or deuterium oxide addition; FT-NIR spectral changes are reconstituted by water addition. Water absorption depends on being free or complexed with polar compounds in oil. The size of absorption is not related to abundance, but on unique absorption specificity of components; water shows the strongest absorption. Heat removes water and volatiles, leaving behind DAG, FFA, and phenolics, and makes it possible to differentiate absorption of water, volatile and non-volatile carbonyls. Cloudy olive oils are analyzed using FT-NIR methodology after warming for 3 min at 50 °C. FT-NIR index values are replaced by a new calibration model based on correlating gravimetric mass loss of water plus volatiles with spectral changes. The FT-NIR methodology is expanded to include EVOOs with 15.5% to 21% linoleic acid. Practical Application. Testing for authenticity of EVOOs remains a challenge because adulterations continue to be a problem due to economic gains. Spectroscopy methods, specifically FT-NIR, are much preferred to targeted chemical methods because they measure all constituents in products and are non-destructive and fast. The current universal FT-NIR methodology assesses 13 different parameters: five major FAs, and the DAG and FFA contents. The FT-NIR index value measuring the content of moisture plus volatiles is now replaced by a gravimetric determination. The methodology identifies four major types of adulterants, high in oleic acid, linoleic acid, palm olein or ROO. The composition of olive oils makes it necessary to develop five oil-specific groups, but cloudy samples still need to be clarified by slight warming before measuring. The value of this universal FT-NIR methodology will increase after being adopted by commercial and in regulatory settings. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	5			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000288					FSTA:2021-08-Ne1955

Food Science and Biotechnology					Fresh-cut lettuce is a very well-known salad for today's routines because it obliges minimal preparation to minimize the loss of health beneficial vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and other phytochemicals. It is a prodigious challenge to serve its consumers fresh. Quality of freshly processed lettuce under high CO2 modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) has been investigated as a realistic alternative technique for its preservation. Storage under high CO2 atmospheric treatments exhibited a significant impact in microbial development, electrolyte leakage, volatile metabolites and sensory quality of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce. This storage condition (MAP 1: 5 kPa O2 and 20 kPa CO2 balanced by N2 at 7 °C for 6 days) inhibited the growth of mesophilic bacteria and yeasts; delayed the enzymatic browning (cut-edges and intact surface) of fresh-cut iceberg lettuce and overall visual quality was also in acceptance limit. The development of off-odors was perceived in high CO2 MAP as a consequence of volatiles (ethanol and acetaldehyde) accumulation which was persisted at an inexcusable level during 6 days of storage periods. ©The Author(s) 2021.										2021	30	3	413	421	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00881-4					FSTA:2021-08-Jq9992
J		Azman, E. M.; House, A.; Charalampopoulos, D.; Chatzifragkou, A.							Effect of dehydration on phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) pomace.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This study examined the effect of dehydration on the phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity of blackcurrant (Ribes nigrum L.) pomaces (DBP) subjected to hot air oven drying (HOD), industrial rotary drying (IRD) and freeze drying (FD). Temperature and residence time were evaluated for HOD, whereas air-on and air-off temperature, ratio of drum rotor speed to air speed and particle size were evaluated for IRD. The highest total anthocyanins (ATC) and flavonols (FLV) were obtained in particle size of> 5.0 mm using IRD at 475 °C/97 °C (air-on/air-off) and higher ratio of drum rotor speed to air speed. Smaller size particles were found susceptible to degradation due to high temperature and retention time applied in IRD, resulting in loss of phenolic compounds in DBP, and thus, HOD was deemed more suitable. Overall, drying method selection and parameters of operation are key in preserving the concentrations of individual HCA and FLV in DBP. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Mohamed							Egyptian chia seeds (Salvia hispanica L.) during germination: upgrading of phenolic profile, antioxidant, antibacterial properties and relevant enzymes activities.		Food Science and Biotechnology					Little studies on chia sprouts were not deeply address the polyphenols profiles and their functional properties during long period of germination. This study aims to evaluate the impact of germination process on the phenolic profile, antioxidant and antibacterial properties and relevant enzymes activities of Egyptian chia seeds. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of chia sprouts increased several times during ten days of germination and maximized on 7-day sprouts (6.4 and 11.5 folds, respectively). In HPLC analysis, seventeen phenolic compounds were detected on 7-day sprouts compared to fifteen in dry seeds, where two new phenolic compounds (p-coumaric acid and kaempferol) were detected. The concentrations of all the identified phenolic compounds increased several folds (1.8-27) on 7-day sprouts. The total antioxidant activity increased 10,17, and 29 folds on 7-day sprouts using DPPH, ABTS and PMC antioxidant methods, respectively compared to the dry seeds. Both antioxidant and carbohydrate-cleaving enzymes increased in chia sprouts and correlated with their phenolic content and antioxidant activity. The phenolic content of 7-day sprouts showed a potent antibacterial activity against some human enteric pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli O157-H7, Salmonella typhi, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureuswith lower MIC values compared to the raw seeds. © The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2021.										2021	30	5	723	734	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-021-00902-2					FSTA:2021-09-Na2167

Wahab							Improvement of melting and crystallisation properties of rambutan seed fat as cocoa butter improver by two-stage fractionation technique.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The search for hard fats is increasing by the day due to their demand for industrial purposes. Rambutan seed fat (RSF) was fractionated prior to investigate the melting and crystallisation behaviours, triacylglycerols (TAGs), and morphology using different chromatographic and thermal techniques. The increasing trends were observed for high-melting symmetrical monounsaturated TAGs such as 1,3-distearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol and 1-palmitoyl-3-stearoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol in both solid fractions upon fractionation. The solid fractions (F1-S) and (F2-S) exhibited small peaks towards low melting area and big peaks towards high melting area with the offset temperatures of 35.29-48.75 °C and 43.58-52.70 °C with significantly higher enthalpies (93.49 and 105.13 J g-1) upon fractionation. F2-S showed the densely packed microstructure compared to that of crude RSF and F1-S. Based on the thermal behaviours as well as morphology of RSF fractions, cocoa butter improver could be prepared that has the potential to be utilised in chocolate manufacturing in tropical countries. © 2020 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).

J		Baawad, A.; Rice, C.; Hamil, T.; Murphy, K.; Joshua Park; Dong-Shik Kim							Molecular weight effects of low acyl gellan gum on antioxidant capacity and rheological properties.		Journal of Food Science					The current study investigated the antioxidant capacity of enzymatically cleaved low acyl gellan gum (LA-GAGR) fragments, named midi-GAGR (MWv: 1.2 * 105 Da) and mini-GAGR (MWv: 2.5 * 104 Da). Three different methods-hydroxide assay, superoxide assay, and DPPH assay-were used to measure the antioxidant capacity of the low acyl gellan gum fragments. Both mini-GAGR and midi-GAGR showed similar antioxidant capacities, 27.1% and 25.6%, respectively, for hydroxide radicals, whereas ascorbic acid showed 9.8%. For superoxide radicals, the fragments scavenged 41.7% (mini) and 35.6% (midi) of free radicals compared to 10.6% removal by ascorbic acid. Mini-and midi-GAGR displayed modest scavenging capabilities with DPPH radicals (8.5% and 6.6%, respectively) as compared to ascorbic acid (96.3%). Both midi- and mini-GAGR showed less gel-like behaviors than LA-GAGR. Midi-GAGR was observed to have a transition from liquid to gel at 63 rad/s. Practical Application. The results in the manuscript are helpful when gellan gum and its derivatives are directly applied to food processing as a dietary fiber supplement or a stabilizer for functional beverages. The antioxidant capacity results can be used to promote the functionality of gellan gum as a food additive and for controlling cell adhesion and growth on gellan gum scaffolds. The rheology results will be useful for synthesis of scaffolds for bone tissue generation and facilitating clinical treatments when gellan gum is injected as an adsorbent or a filler for treating bone fractures. In the pharmaceutical industry, they are useful when controlling the therapeutic effects of drug delivery systems. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Baba, W. N.; Priti Mudgil; Hina Kamal; Priya Kilari, B.; Chee-Yuen Gan; Sajid Maqsood							Identification and characterization of novel alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory peptides from camel whey proteins.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study explores the inhibitory properties of camel whey protein hydrolysates (CWPH) toward alpha-amylase (AAM) and alpha-glucosidase (AG). A general full factorial design (3 * 3) was applied to study the effect of temperature (30, 37, and 45°C), time (120, 240, and 360 min), and enzyme (pepsin) concentration (E%; 0.5, 1, and 2%). The results showed that maximum degree of hydrolysis was obtained when hydrolysis was carried out at higher temperature (45°C; P< 0.05), compared with lower temperatures of 30 and 37°C. Electrophoretic pattern displays degradation of all protein bands upon hydrolysis by pepsin at various hydrolysis conditions applied. All the 27 CWPH generated showed significant AAM and AG inhibitory potential as indicated by their lower IC50 values (mg/mL) compared with intact whey proteins. In total 196 peptides were identified from selected hydrolysates and 15 potential peptides (PepSite score > 0.8) were explored via in silico approach. Novel peptides PAGNFLMNGLMHR, PAVACCLPPLPCHM, MLPLMLPFTMGY, and PAGNFLPPVAAAPVM were identified as potential inhibitors for both AAM and AG due to their high number of binding sites and highest binding probability toward the target enzymes. CCGM and MFE, as well as FCCLGPVPP were identified as AG and AAM inhibitory peptides, respectively. This is the first study that reports novel AG and AAM inhibitory peptides from camel whey proteins. The future direction for this research involves synthesis of these potential AG and AAM inhibitory peptides in a pure form and investigate their antidiabetic properties in the in vitro, as well as in vivo models. Thus, CWPH can be considered for potential applications in glycaemic regulation. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Baba, Y.; Inagaki, S.; Nakagawa, S.; Kaneko, T.; Kobayashi, M.; Takihara, T.							Effects of L-theanine on cognitive function in middle-aged and older subjects: a randomized placebo-controlled study.		Journal of Medicinal Food					L-theanine (gamma-glutamylethylamide), an amino acid in green tea, has been shown to affect brain functions by relieving stress disorders, improving mood, and maintaining normal sleep. However, the cognitive functions for which theanine is effective are unclear. This study aimed to clarify which cognitive functions are positively affected by intake of L-theanine. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted. The subjects were Japanese men and women aged 50-69 years. Mini Mental State Examination-Japanese version score was 24 or higher. Cognitrax was used as a test battery for cognitive function. Evaluations were performed before the intervention, after a single dose of L-theanine, and after 12 weeks of regular intake. The single dose of L-theanine reduced the reaction time to attention tasks (Stroop test, Part 1), and it increased the number of correct answers and decreased the number of omission errors in working memory tasks (4-Part continuous performance test, Part 4). In conclusion, our study indicated that L-theanine may contribute to improving attention, thus enhancing working memory and executive functions. Clinical Trial No.: UMIN000033812.

J		Babaahmadifooladi, M.; Jacxsens, L.							Chronic dietary exposure to nickel from selected foods consumed in Belgium.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					The risk assessment conducted by the European Food Safety Authority stated some concerns regarding the chronic exposure of the European population to nickel due to food intake. This study aimed to evaluate the extent of the Belgian population's exposure to nickel via intake of different foods/drinks available in their market. Ni concentrations were measured in selected foods consumed in Belgium, and exposures from this limited group of foods were estimated for consumers of these foods. Legumes, soy products, breakfast cereals, and chocolate spreads were responsible for 26%, 14%, 11% and 8% of the overall exposure (overall chronic exposure through consuming all the included food types in this study except tap water) of children (3-9 years) to nickel. For adolescents (10-17 years), the highest percentage of overall chronic exposure again originated from legumes (19%). This was followed by breakfast cereals (14%), soy products (11%) and chocolate spreads (11%). For adults (18-64 years), major contributors to the overall chronic daily exposure were legumes (16%), dark chocolate (15%) and breakfast cereals (10%). The aggregate exposure assessment, including the highest contaminated foods, for different sub-populations, revealed mean exposure levels of 1.02, 0.60 and 0.34 mug kg-1 b. W. Day-1 for children, adolescents, and adults respectively. The mean, P75, P90 and P95 values for aggregate chronic exposure of the overall consumer's population were 0.62, 0.80, 1.5 and 210 mug kg-1 b. W. Day-1 respectively. This study recommends controlling the intake of food products with elevated nickel content especially for the more vulnerable sub-population groups such as children with lower body weight and nickel sensitised individuals. It also demonstrates a shift in potential risk on human health to nickel exposure due to the transition towards a more plant-based diet. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	1	95	112	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1833088					FSTA:2021-05-Cf1420
J		Babaahmadifooladi, M.; Jacxsens, L.; Wiele, T. van de; Junior, E. C. da S.; Laing, G. du							Assessment of bioaccessible and dialyzable fractions of nickel in food products and their impact on the chronic exposure of Belgian population to nickel.		Food Chemistry					This study aimed to investigate bioaccessible/dialyzable fractions of nickel in selected foods and to clarify the impact of the food digestion/absorption on the final exposure of consumers to nickel. In vitro gastrointestinal incubation experiments were conducted to estimate the bioaccessibility of nickel in different foods. For estimation of a dialyzable fraction, dialysis filtration was conducted. Highest bioaccessibility (99.6%) was observed for wheat-based breakfast cereals. Lowest bioaccessibilities was observed for dried-fruits (on average 20.4%). Highest (61.5%) and lowest (24.5%) dialyzable fractions were observed for wheat-based breakfast cereal and chocolate respectively. Bioaccessible/dialyzable fractions based exposure assessments were highlighted the overestimation of exposures calculated based on total nickel concentrations in foods. This is particularly important when exposure values were compared with toxicological thresholds in a risk characterization study. When threshold values have been obtained through animal studies in which nickel was dosed at 100% accessibility/availability, e.g. nickel salts this is even more important.

Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, Alyssum homolocarpum (AH) and Lepidium sativum seed gum (LS) at different ratios 1:0, 1:1, and 0:1 utilized to encapsulate red onion extract (ROE). In the first step, the total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoid content (TFC), and antioxidant activity of ROE were characterized. Further, the DPPH and FRAP assay showed that ROE at 1600 ppm exhibited highly antioxidant potential (DPPH=88.36%, FRAP=35.42%), and used for encapsulation. The chemical, microbial and sensory properties of beef fillets were monitored at days 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 of storage at 4 °C. Our results indicated that encapsulated ROE in AH : LS coating was more efficient in retardation of microbial chemical reactions of coated meat fillet and the shelf life was extended from 4 to 16 days due to inhibition of bacterial growth, reduction in pH, peroxide value, thiobarbituric value and microbial growth. Also, free ROE showed good preservative than 200 ppm of synthetic BHT preservative. This study confirmed that the encapsulated ROE in AH : LS coating, is a potential coating to improve the quality and shelf life of beef fillet. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	5	4771	4780	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00985-9					FSTA:2022-01-Sg0335
J		Babak Athari; Ali Nasirpour; Sima Saeidy; Ali Esehaghbeygi							Physicochemical properties of whipped cream stabilized with electrohydrodynamic modified cellulose.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Cellulose was extracted from sugarcane bagasse and treated with electrohydrodynamic (EHD) device. The EHD-treated and non-treated cellulose fibers were added to whipping cream at three levels of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% wt/wt. Whipped cream was prepared using different fat concentrations (25%, 30%, and 35% wt/wt). Analysis of physicochemical properties showed that increasing cellulose and fat concentrations increased viscosity, firmness, overrun, and stability against syneresis in whipped cream. Superior textural and color quality (greater whiteness index and lower yellowness index) were observed in whipped cream samples contained modified cellulose compared to those consisting non-modified cellulose at each fat level. The sample prepared with 1.5% of modified cellulose and 30% of fat exhibited preferable stability, textural, and color properties compared to those contained 0.5%-1.5% non-modified cellulose and 35% fat. The current study showed that EHD-treated cellulose fiber with improved textural properties could be used in fat-reduced cream. Novelty impact statement. Cellulose was extracted from sugarcane bagasse and treated with electrohydrodynamic device.

Determination of phenolics composition, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic potential of Golden marguerite (Cota tinctoria).		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Yellow chamomile (Cota tinctoria) is used for dye production in food industries and some health benefits as an herbal tea. This work was designed to comprehensively evaluate phenolic profiling, antioxidant activity, and therapeutic target enzymes' inhibitory effect of C. tinctoria using chromatographic and spectroscopic methods. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis and total phenol and flavonoid content determination were performed to investigate phenolics composition and concentration. Chlorogenic acid (6518 and 8338 g/g extract), rutin (752 and 1196 g/g extract), catechin (764 and 804 g/g extract), and apigenin (662 and 164 g/g extract) were determined As the major phenolics of methanolic extract and infusion, respectively. The antioxidant ability of methanolic extract and infusion of the herb was tested using six different mechanisms. Promising antiradical properties were recorded in DPPH and ABTS test (125-275 mg Trolox equivalents/g sample). Also, methanolic extract and infusion exhibited high reducing power (207-350 mg TE/g sample). Moreover, yellow chamomile showed moderate cholinesterase inhibitory (0.2-1.7 mg GALE/g extract), antidiabetic (0.06-0.55 mmol AE/g extract), and tyrosinase inhibitory (11.12 mg KAE/g extract) activities.

J		Babak Pakbin; Pishkhan Dibazar, S.; Samaneh Allahyari; Maryam Javadi; Alireza Farasat; Sina Darzi							Probiotic Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii supernatant inhibits survivin gene expression and induces apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells.		Food Science & Nutrition					Natural anticancer drug and compounds with other great benefits are of interest recently due to lower side effects than chemotherapy for cancer treatment and prevention. Different natural and synthetic drugs have been suggested to be used for treatment of gastric cancers, the second deadly cancer worldwide. The aim of this study was to investigate anticancer activity of SBS including inducing apoptosis and inhibition of survivin gene expression in gastric cancer cells. We evaluated cell viability, inducing apoptosis and change in survivin gene expression of EPG85-257P (EPG) and EPG85-257RDB (resistant to Daunorubicin, RDB) cell lines under exposure of SBS after 24, 48, and 72 hr. We found that SBS decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis, and reduced survivin gene expression in treated EPG and RDB cells (with the significant IC50 values of 387 and 575 g/ml after 72 and 48 hr for EPG and RDB cells respectively). However, we observed SBS was more efficient to induce apoptosis in EPG than RDB cells. We strongly suggest SBS be considered as a prospective anticancer agent or in formulation of complementary medication to treat and prevent gastric cancers. © 2020 The Authors.

Food Science & Nutrition					The emergence of multidrug-resistant Shigella is a significant threat to global public health. Limited studies have investigated the incidence, antimicrobial susceptibility, and genetic diversity of Shigella isolated from food products. Conventional culture-based, serologic, molecular, disk diffusion, PCR, and RAPD-PCR methods were used to determine the prevalence rate, phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance profile, and genetic diversity of the Shigella isolates from food samples including vegetable salad, ground meat, and raw cow's milk (405 samples). The prevalence rate of Shigella in food samples was 4.44%. The incidence of S. sonnei (3.7%) was higher than that of S. flexneri (0.74%). S. dysenteriae and S. boydii were not detected in food samples examined. Also, no Shigella were recovered from raw cow's milk. This study showed that the Shigella isolates were resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (83.3%), amoxicillin (66.6%), streptomycin (66.6%), tetracycline (61.1%), ampicillin (50%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (50%), azithromycin (50%), and chloramphenicol (50%) and completely sensitive to cefoxitin, cefepime, amikacin, and gentamicin. All Shigella isolates were multidrug-resistant. We detected blaSHV resistance gene in all isolates; however, no isolate harbored blaTEM gene. RAPD-PCR categorized the Shigella isolates into five main clusters. The highest antibiotic resistance was observed in the isolates of cluster R4. The finding of this study also indicated an association between antimicrobial resistance profiles and genotyping properties of the isolates. Novel food monitoring systems, including surveillance of multidrug-resistant foodborne pathogens, especially in developing countries, are required to control the foodborne diseases. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Babaoglu, H. C.; Tontul, S. A.; Akin, N.							Fiber enrichment of sourdough bread by inulin rich Jerusalem artichoke powder.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aims to determine the effects of Jerusalem artichoke powder (JAP) utilization on the physical quality and nutritional characteristics of sourdough bread. JAP was applied to both sourdough fermentation medium and bread formulation. The increasing rates of JAP had deteriorated effects on the physical properties (specific volume, color, and texture profile) of bread. JAP decreased significantly in vitro starch digestion rate in sourdough bread. The glycemic index value of 20% JAP-containing sourdough bread was detected to be 75.12. Additionally, total dietary fiber content increased from 2.62 to 5.30/100 g, by JAP incorporation. The total phenolic content and antioxidant activity of control were determined as 43.72 mg GA/100 g and 48.78 mol TE/100 g, respectively. In comparison, these values were 80.60 mg GA/100 g and 130.77 mol TE/100 g in samples supplemented with 20% JAP. According to the sensory analysis, utilization of JAP, over 10% resulted in quite low points. Practical applications. Inulin is generally used to increase dietary fiber content and decrease the glycemic index of foods. On the other hand, the utilization of foods with inulin-rich JAP not only increases the dietary fiber content but also enriches it with bioactive components and phytochemicals. However, the high addition levels of JAP can deteriorative effects on the sensory features of foods. In this study, due to the specific aroma and sour taste of sourdough bread, JAP was used above the levels stated in the literature without creating a negative effect on the sensory. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of sieving on nutritional value, glycemic index, and carbohydrate digestive enzymes activity of gruel made from maize and sorghum.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Cereal gruels are an important staple food in humid part of Africa, and commonly used as weaning food for children and the convalescents. This study sought to evaluate the effect of sieving; an important step in production of gruel. The cereal were soaked with distilled water for 72 hr, rinsed, and wet-milled, thereafter, portioned into two (sieved and Unsieved), and freeze dried. The nutritional value, mineral content, glycemic index, and alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase inhibitory ability of cereal gruels were investigated. The results make known that Unsieved gruel had a higher (p> 0.05) nutritional value and mineral content than sieved gruel. The sieved gruel had higher free sugar and glycemic index than the Unsieved. Nonetheless, the gruel extract inhibited alpha-amylase and alpha-glucosidase activity judging by their IC50 values in vitro. Based on the results of this study, it can be argued that unsieved gruels had better nutritional contents than sieved gruel. Practical applications. Cereal gruels are commonly used as weaning food for children and the convalescence, there are concerns about the nutritional value of the food over the time, and this had led to different ways of enhancing the nutritional value through fortification with other substance but the originality of the food is being eroded. However, exclusion of sieving in the processing step, improves the nutritional value of the gruel. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Occurrence of Alternaria and other toxins in cereal grains intended for animal feeding collected in Slovenia: a three-year study.		Toxins					In recent years, the less-studied Alternaria mycotoxins have attracted increasing interest due to the lack of survey data and their ability to cause toxic effects in animals and humans. To fill the gap, the aim of this three-year survey was to investigate the presence and co-occurrence of Alternaria and other mycotoxins in a total of 433 cereal grain samples from Slovenian farms and agricultural cooperatives from 2014 to 2016. Using the multi-mycotoxin method, 14 mycotoxins were determined. In 53% of 433 analysed samples, contamination with at least one mycotoxin was found. Deoxynivalenol (DON) and tenuazonic acid (TeA) were present in 32% and 26% of cereal grain samples, respectively, whereas alternariol (AOH), tentoxin (TEN), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), 3- and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3- and 15-AcDON), and zearalenone (ZEN) were present in fewer than 15% of the samples. Ochratoxin A (OTA) was found in one rye sample, while diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS), HT-2 and T-2 toxin, and fumonisins B1 and B2 (FB1 and FB2) were not detected. The highest maximum and median concentrations of Alternaria toxins were determined in spelt in 2016 (TeA, 2277 g/kg and 203 g/kg, respectively), and those of Fusarium toxins in wheat in 2015 (DON, 4082 g/kg and 387 g/kg, respectively). The co-occurrence of two or more mycotoxins was found in 43% of the positive samples. The correlations between Alternaria toxins were very weak but statistically significant (r: 0.15-0.17, p: 0.0042-0.0165). A well-known correlation between Fusarium toxins DON and ZEN was weak and highly significant (r = 0.28, p< 0.0001). © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Bioactive compounds, nutritional and sensory properties of cookies prepared with wheat and tigernut flour.		Food Chemistry					This study aimed to evaluate cookies made with wheat (0%, 80%, 60%, and 50%) and tigernut flour (0%, 20%, 40%, and 50%) from two different sources. Standard methods were applied to determine the chemical properties, phenolic component, fatty acid composition, mineral content, and sensory properties of cookies. Tigernut flour from both sources was rich in oil, and total and individual phenolics, but with low antioxidant activity compared to wheat flour. The addition of tigernut flour to wheat resulted in increase of the content of bioactive compounds, minerals, and fatty acid contents of cookies. The cookies produced by formulating wheat with tigernut had a comparable organoleptic quality scores to wheat flour cookies. The production of cookies with both wheat and tigernut flour showed that this mixture is an interesting opportunity to have a functional product rich in bioactive compounds and considered satisfactory by consumers.

Journal of Food Quality					Chyawanprash, a polyherbal formulation, is popular for its nutritional value and is widely used as a tonic, rejuvenator, immunomodulator, and enhancer. This study aimed to evaluate the quality profile of five different brands of Chyawanprash marketed in Nepal. Proximate analysis, estimation of heavy metal, physicochemical analysis, determination of microbial contamination, estimation of vitamin C, and detection of heavy metals were carried out to assess the therapeutical values and compare the quality control parameters. All the analyses were carried out based on standard procedures. The data analysis revealed that the presence of moisture content (11.831.61%-19.900.92%), ash content (1.2-2.3%), energy (316.121.96-36311.90Kcal/100g), acid-insoluble ash content (0.120.05-1.470.26%), pH (5.12-5.34), vitamin C (9.92-28.58mg/100g), and heavy metals was not detected in ppm in any of the brands. Chyawanprash holds tremendous amounts of nutritional value suitable for treating different types of illness. Thus, stringent quality control parameters should be implemented from the government level for product consistency and to reduce variation among different brands.

Use of modified atmosphere packaging combined with essential oils for prolonging post-harvest shelf life of mango (cv. Banganapalli and cv. Totapuri).		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to evaluate the combined application of modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) with essential oil (EO) vapours (Thyme, Clove, and Cinnamon) on the shelf life extension of cv. Banganapalli and cv. Totapuri mango fruit. The fruit quality was evaluated in terms of postharvest disease incidence and severity, physicochemical and sensory parameters. Also, the antioxidant enzyme activities, total phenolic, and flavonoid contents, DPPH radical scavenging activity, weight loss, and CO2 evolution were studied. Our results demonstrated that MAP + thyme oil vapour (TO) treatment significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the incidence and severity of anthracnose, and loss of fruit firmness. The MAP + TO treatment enhanced the shelf life of cv. Banganapalli up to 26 2 days and cv. Totapuri up to 23 2 days. MAP + Cinnamon EO treated fruits exhibited a shelf life of 22 2 and 19 1 days for cv. Banganapalli and cv. Totapuri, respectively whereas MAP + Clove EO prolonged the shelf life of mango up to 21 2 days for cv. Banganapalli and 20 1 days for cv. Totapuri fruits. The results of this study showed that a MAP + EO treatment could effectively control postharvest decay and preserve the physicochemical quality of mango fruits, extending their shelf life.

Optimization of protein extraction of oenological interest from grape seed meal using design of experiments and response surface methodology.		Foods					After grape processing, large amounts of seeds are produced as a side product. Grape seeds are rich in proteins that could be extracted and revalorized by the wine industry due to their high techno-functional value for modulating quality features of red wines or as an alternative to the use of other stabilizers, which are also proteins but submitted to legal restrictions. Box-Behnken design and response surface methodology were used to optimize the protein extraction from defatted grape seed meal to maximize the protein purity of the isolate under practical operating conditions of pH, temperature, meal/water ratio and extraction time. The most significant factor was pH, both in the linear and quadratic forms. Additionally, the interaction between pH and temperature exhibited a significant effect on protein content. The removal of phenolic compounds from grapeseed meal, before optimizing protein extraction, led to a significant increase of 7.70% in the protein purity of grape seed protein concentrate. Therefore, grape seeds can be used as a sustainable way for protein production in the oenological sector due to the availability of grape seeds, their low cost as a grape-processing by-product, and the protein purity reached thanks to the described procedure for optimization of protein extraction. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bacala, R.; Bin Xiao Fu; Cordova, K.; Hatcher, D. W.							Wheat Fusarium protease specificity and effect on dough properties.		Foods					Fusarium infection is a worldwide agricultural problem of billion dollar proportions globally, and it has increasingly threatened entire regional food supplies. In addition to the toxin deoxynivalenol (DON), Fusarium species express digestive enzymes that degrade starch and protein, affecting the quality of infected grains, especially wheat processing performance which depends largely on gluten proteins. In this study, the impact of Fusarium protease on the functionality of Canada Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat was assessed by adding Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK) to a FDK-free base wheat sample. Digestion of beta-casein by extracts of flours, milled from sound and FDK-spiked wheat samples, demonstrated elevated cleavage in FDK-spiked flour extracts as follows: N-terminal to lysine (eight-fold), N-and C-terminal to isoleucine (four-fold and three-fold, respectively), N-terminal to tyrosine (three-fold) and C-terminal to arginine at P1′ (five-fold). Comparison of abbreviated (45 min) and standard (135 min) extensigraph test results indicated that desirable increases in dough resistance to extension (Rmax) due to gluten re-polymerization after longer resting were partially to completely counteracted in FDK-spiked flours in a dose-dependent manner. Baking tests confirmed that while loaf volume is similar, proofed dough from FDK-spiked samples caused detectable loaf collapse at 3% FDK. Extensigraph Rmax and Fusarium protease levels were inversely related, and effected by both the extent and severity of infection. While the current FDK tolerances for grading Canadian wheat can effectively control protease damage, prevalence of deoxynivalenol (DON) weak-and non-producing Fusarium strains/species (e.g., F. avenaceum) in some growing regions must be considered to protect functionality if grading is solely based on DON content. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Background. Each country has specific social, cultural, and economic characteristics regarding the motivations for improving health. The aim of this study was to evaluate demographic characteristics, anthropometric data, and elements related to food behavior and health, as well as Romanians' motivations towards healthy eating. Methods. This is a descriptive cross-sectional questionnaire based study enrolling 751 Romanian participants, which was carried out in in 2017-2018. Results. We obtained a positive correlation between age and Body Mass Index, and this was maintained also when we analyzed the two genders separately, being, however, even stronger for women. The number of hours/day spent watching TV or in front of the computer was positively correlated with both age and BMI. In general, with aging, there is an increasing concern regarding the practice of a healthy diet. The higher education level was significantly associated with healthier choices. Conclusions. The study of the three dietary dimensions, food properties, health attitudes, and dietary behavior, vis-vis various disorders revealed that the group most concerned of their diet was those who suffered from cardiovascular disorders. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Baccarani, A.; Brand, G.; Dacremont, C.; Valentin, D.; Brochard, R.							The influence of stimulus concentration and odor intensity on relaxing and stimulating perceived properties of odors.		Food Quality and Preference					It is generally assumed that intensity can be used as a proxy of the arousing properties of odors: the more concentrated an odorant, the more intense an odor and the more stimulating and the less relaxing the odor. The aim of the present study was thus to investigate the relationship between relaxing and stimulating properties of odors when judged on two independent scales, for different levels of stimulus concentration. Thirty-three volunteers judged relaxing, stimulating, pleasantness, familiarity and intensity properties of four odors, namely strawberry, lavender, coffee, and lemon, at five concentrations. Our findings show that for all odors, higher stimulus concentration was associated with higher perceived intensity and higher stimulating judgments whereas it was not associated with lower relaxing judgments. On the contrary, lavender and strawberry were also judged more relaxing when stimulus concentration increased whereas coffee and lemon relaxing properties remained the same overall whatever the concentration. Odor familiarity increased with stimuli concentration as well as pleasantness (with the exception of coffee odor). Our results underline the need to use two separate unipolar scales when assessing the relaxing and stimulating properties of odors in self-report questionnaires. They also question the suitability of the commonly used bidimensional framework (valence vs. arousal) to describe olfactory emotions. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Foods					In the context of the ongoing debate on front-of-pack labels (FOPL), extant research highlights a lack of clear indications on which label is most effective in increasing consumers' knowledge of food nutritional quality, and in favoring informed food choices. In this study, we have compared the effects of two different labels, one nutrient-specific label (i.e., NutrInform Battery) and one summary label (i.e., Nutri-Score), in terms of consumers' "subjective understanding" and "liking". Our work advances prior research on FOPL performance by focusing on two different countries-which have different socio-political contexts and which, from previous studies, present limited evidence on the topic-Slovenia, currently utilizing the Protective Food logo, and the Netherlands, who has recently adopted the Nutri-Score. The study also confirms, in line with previous research, a higher effectiveness of the nutrient-specific label, NutrInform Battery, on all analyzed dimensions in tested countries, when compared to the summary label, Nutri-Score. © 2021 by the authors.

Food and Bioproducts Processing					We describe techniques to rapidly increase the yield of bioactive compounds from plant sources such as elder bark and annatto seeds using microwave dielectric heating and ultrasonic cavitation bubbles, a substantial improvement over conventional heating methods. For elder bark, the optimal extraction parameters were obtained with ethanol, using 0.01 L g-1 of solvent to material and extracting for at least an hour at 55 °C. Ursolic acid was found to be more abundant in barks. Under the optimal conditions, the yields of oleanolic acid and ursolic acid were about 86% while using ultrasound assisted extraction and about 92% while using microwaves, respectively. Using the optimal extraction parameters for annatto seeds: ethyl acetate, the ratio of solvent to material at 0.05 L g-1 and at least 30 min. Extraction time, the yield of bixin reached about 85% with sonication and 95% with microwave heating. Assisted extraction techniques, with microwave assisted extraction being the most optimal technique, enhanced the extraction efficiencies and extracted higher concentrations when compared to standard methods.

Food Analytical Methods					Meltability is the property of a cheese to flow and spread, as well as the loss of the integrity of the cheese structure by heating, and is of great importance for cheeses used as ingredients in other products. Analytical methods for determination of cheese meltability are laborious and time-consuming, requiring heating of cheese samples followed by assessment of the dimensional changes, such as diameter and height. In this study, computer vision is proposed for rapid and accurate determination of meltability for five different types of cheese and compared to the reference Schreiber method. Digital images were acquired from the samples before and after melting, and the variation of samples was measured after segmentation and identification of the region of interest (ROI). The meltability measured by the Schreiber method varied from 0 to 45.37%, while the results determined by the computer vision method varied from 0.37 to 99.64%. The computer vision method presented high correlation with the Schreiber method, providing better results for samples that had irregular shape after melting, when compared to the traditional method. Additionally, the correlation between the manual and the automatic methods was calculated and the results showed a perfect correlation between all the computer vision methods. (>0.99). The results indicate the potential application of computer vision as a standard analytical method for determination of cheese meltability. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Near infrared hyperspectral imaging and spectral unmixing methods for evaluation of fiber distribution in enriched pasta.		Food Chemistry					Pasta is mostly composed by wheat flour and water. Nevertheless, flour can be partially replaced by fibers to provide extra nutrients in the diet. However, fiber can affect the technological quality of pasta if not properly distributed. Usually, determinations of parameters in pasta are destructive and time-consuming. The use of Near Infrared-Hyperspectral Imaging (NIR-HSI), together with machine learning methods, is valuable to improve the efficiency in the assessment of pasta quality. This work aimed to investigate the ability of NIR-HSI and augmented Multivariate Curve Resolution-Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) for the evaluation, resolution and quantification of fiber distribution in enriched pasta. Results. Showed R2V between 0.28 and 0.89, %LOF < 6%, variance explained over 99%, and similarity between pure and recovered spectra over 96% and 98% in models using pure flour and control as initial estimates, respectively, demonstrating the applicability of NIR-HSI and MCR-ALS in the identification of fiber in pasta.

Food Chemistry					The disinfection of water for human consumption with chlorine or other compounds produces secondary reactions with the organic matter, generating undesirable disinfection by-products (DBPs). Among these are trihalomethanes (THMs), identified as carcinogenic compounds. This work determined the trihalomethanes concentration, both speciated and total, in treated water distributed and stored in tanks of residential condominiums of different social classes. THMs were quantified using static manual Headspace as preconcentration technique, injecting the vapor phase collected in a GC/FID. The results show that the water distributed to the homes already contains THMs, trichloromethane being the major compound. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) with 60 water samples showed that there is no significant distinction among samples of treated water distributed water and water stored in tanks. This study warns to the importance of controlling the formation of trihalomethanes in water throughout treatment and distribution for users. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Physicochemical and microbiological characteristics of El-Guedid from meat of different animal species.		Meat Science					El-Guedid is an Algerian traditional meat-based product that is prepared from red meats. It belongs to the wide diversity of salted/dried meat products. This study described the physicochemical and microbiological properties of different products from four animal origins and during all the conservation. Results. Indicated that these products were mainly characterized by a low moisture with an average decrease of water content between 15.6% and 16.3% for all the samples, and a decrease in water activity ranging from 0.66 to 0.68, while the salt content ranged from 8.8 to 19.3%. A decrease in pH values oscillated from (6.3-6.4) to reach (5.2-5.5) at T0 and T365 consecutively, in all the samples. Microbial analyses revealed the absence of pathogenic bacteria such as Listeria and Salmonella but the sporadic contamination by Staphylococcus aureus up to one month of ripening. Lactic acid bacteria and coagulase negative staphylococci were the dominant populations in El-Guedid with Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus sakei, and Staphylococcus saprophyticusas the main species identified. All these populations decreased along the process and reached low levels (2 log CFU/g) at the end of storage (365 days). The drastic drying of El-Guedid led to safe traditional meat product that could promote its production. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Badia, A. Della; Hervas, G.; Toral, P. G.; Frutos, P.							Individual differences in responsiveness to diet-induced milk fat depression in dairy sheep and goats.		Journal of Dairy Science					Both sheep and goats can display very different individual degrees of milk fat depression (MFD), which might explain some apparent contradictions in the literature. Because the antilipogenic effect of certain fatty acids (FA) is the most likely origin of MFD, characterizing the milk FA profile of animals showing different degrees of MFD seems a helpful step to understand the physiological basis of the tolerance or susceptibility to the syndrome. Analyzing whether specific traits may predetermine a particular responsiveness would also be of relevance to meet this aim. However, information about these aspects is scant, not only in goats and sheep but in ruminants in general. This study was conducted with 25 Murciano-Granadina does and 23 Assaf ewes that were fed a total mixed ration without lipid supplementation for 3 wk (control period). Then, all animals received the same basal diet supplemented with 2% of fish oil (FO) for 5 additional weeks (MFD period). At the end of this second period, and on the basis of the extent of FO-induced decreases in milk fat concentration, the 5 most responsive (RESPON+) and the 5 least responsive (RESPON-) animals were selected within each species, 20 in total. Milk yield and composition, including a comprehensive FA profile, were examined at the end of each period. By design, between-group variation in milk fat concentration and yield was substantial, but no significant interaction with the effect of species was detected. Reductions in these 2 performance traits averaged 6% in RESPON-and 26% in RESPON+. Results do not allow suggesting that responsiveness to MFD would be clearly predetermined neither by the studied performance traits nor by milk FA profile, although a certain relationship with energy balance might exist. Furthermore, variations in ewes and does displaying different individual degrees of MFD may be associated with changes in certain candidate milk fat inhibitors, such as trans-10 18:1 and cis-9 16:1, whereas trans-10, cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid would only have a minor role in determining MFD severity. Alterations in the molar yield of de novo and preformed FA suggest relevant differences in the mechanisms underlying MFD in RESPON+ and RESPON-, with interspecies effects being observed only in more tolerant animals. Further research is still required to elucidate key determinants of responsiveness to MFD. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Badin, E. E.; Quevedo-Leon, R.; Ibarz, A.; Ribotta, P. D.; Lespinard, A. R.							Kinetic modeling of thermal degradation of color, lycopene, and ascorbic acid in crushed tomato.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The kinetics of the thermal degradation of color (L*, a*, and b* coordinates), lycopene (L), and L-ascorbic acid (AA) in crushed tomato were studied over a temperature range of 70 to 100 °C. These results showed that the changes in a*, L, and AA followed a first-order kinetic model (R2>0.91), while those for L* and b* did not fit any suitable kinetic models. The temperature effects on degradation rates were adequately compatible with the Arrhenius equation (R2>0.96) with the following activation energy values (Ea, kJ mol-1): a* (64.54), L (45.96) and AA (25.69). These Ea values indicated that a* was the most sensitive parameter towards temperature changes, while the reaction rate constants (k) showed that L had the highest degradation rate compared with the other parameters studied. A linear relationship between a* and L content was found, suggesting that a* measured instantaneously by tristimulus colorimeters can be used for the online determination of L degradation in crushed tomatoes during heat treatment. The knowledge gained from this study could be useful for improving the design and optimization of the thermal process of crushed tomato in order to preserve its nutritional value and sensory quality. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

Encapsulated Bioactive Ingredients of grape by-products applicate in fresh-cut fruit and juices diminished the ochratoxins.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Various fruits are involved in food models, including fresh-cut fruit, fruit salad, and juices. Toxigenic fungi in horticulture have attracted interest in order to the food safety requirements and their illnesses relation. This study aimed to apply grape by-products (Gbps) that contain bioactive compounds to reduce mycotoxin and limit toxigenic fungal-activity in fresh-cut fruit and juice. The Gbps were collected and extracted using ultra-sonication. Phenolic, flavonoids, antioxidants, and antifungal activities of extracts were evaluated. Grape stem and leaf extracts were micro capsulated to apply as bio-preservatives in food. The stems extract showed higher contents of p-coumaric and Ferulic acids. Leaves extract showed higher contents of epicatechin, quercetin, while rutin was high in both extracts. Stems extract showed high phenolic contents and more antifungal activity than leaves extract. Microcapsules of stem extract provided a greater ochratoxin reduction than that achieved by leaves microcapsules when they applied to juices or fruit salads. Practical Applications. This work aims to extend shelf life and increase the safety of some horticultural products that relatively consumed quickly, such as fresh-cut fruits, fruit salad, and juices. Those products traded in supermarkets as slides or kept deep in solutions. Results. Showed that; utilization of grape by-product extracts as bioactive capsules; formed a film on the product; had potency in the reduction of contamination and mycotoxin possibility, in horticultural products. This application will increase horticultural time availability in markets and facilitate their handling without the risk of contamination increases. In addition, it assists reducing mycotoxins if it was available in raw materials. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Badri Narayanan, K.; Gyu Tae Park; Sung Soo Han							Antibacterial properties of starch-reduced graphene oxide-polyiodide nanocomposite.		Food Chemistry					Graphene-based nanocomposites with superior antibacterial activity are highly sought after by the food packaging industries. Here, we report for the first time a method that utilizes soluble starch biopolymer as a functionalizing and reducing agent for the preparation of starch-reduced graphene oxide (SRGO), whereby polyiodide binds to the helical structures of amylose units of the starch (chromophore) to form a SRGO-polyiodide nanocomposite (SRGO-PI NC). UV-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and energy-dispersive spectroscopy confirmed the presence of polyiodide in SRGO. SRGO-PI NC exhibited good antibacterial activities against pathogenic Gram-negative (Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) microbes with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values (as determined by a broth-dilution method) of 2.5 and 5 mg/ml, respectively, for both E. coli and S. aureus. PrestoBlue viability assays showed half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 0.45 and 0.41 mg/ml for E. coli and S. aureus, respectively. Time-kill kinetic and live/dead bacterial viability assays revealed the antimicrobial activities of SRGO-PI NC against both E. coli and S. aureus. The study provides new insights regarding the utilization of graphene-polyiodide NCs as high-efficacy antibacterial starch-based nanomaterials for food packaging applications.

J		Badri Narayanan, K.; Gyu Tae Park; Sung Soo Han							Biocompatible, antibacterial, polymeric hydrogels active against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains for food packaging applications.		Food Control					Microbial infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria have become a public health threat and cause substantial morbidity and mortality in hospitals as well as in the community and livestock. Pseudomonas aeruginosa YUSA1 isolated from freshwater was found to contain an antagonistic compound against MRSA and other MDR S. aureus strains. The crude ethyl acetate extract (CEE) of cell-free supernatant exhibited in vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm properties against MRSA. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) values of CEE (as determined by broth-dilution) against MRSA were 25 and 50 mug/ml, respectively. The effect of CEE on MRSA biofilm formation was assessed by crystal violet staining and an MTT viability assay. Pretreatment of human skin fibroblasts (HSFs) with CEE dose-dependently inhibited MRSA adhesion and invasion, and in vitro cytotoxicity analysis showed CEE was compatible with HSFs at its MIC and MBC. In addition, an CEE containing poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA/CEE) hydrogel fabricated by freeze-drying method exhibited significant anti-MRSA activity at concentrations ≥200 mug/ml. Our results indicate CEE-incorporated PVA polymeric hydrogels have potential use as a food packaging material with antibacterial and antifouling effects on MRSA and other MDR S. aureus strains.

J		Badrul, S.; Jaafar, A. H.							Potential use of rosemary extract to increase the quality and safety of rendered chicken fat.		International Food Research Journal					A commercial rosemary extract was evaluated for antioxidant effectiveness in rendered chicken fat and antibacterial activity against selected food-borne pathogens. Four treatments were used in the experiment comprising of 25 and 50 ppm rosemary extract (RE), 200 ppm butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA; commercial antioxidant as positive control), and a negative control without antioxidant. All treatments were subjected to oxidative stability analysis tests including free fatty acid (FFA), peroxide value (PV), p-Anisidine value (AV), and total oxidation value (TOTOX), which were analysed weekly for a total period of seven weeks. In addition, RE was tested for antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus using disc diffusion assay (DDA). The results showed that the addition of 50 ppm of RE yielded the most potent antioxidant effect as evidenced by the lowest amounts for negative oxidation indicators (i.e., FFA, PV, AV, and TOTOX) as compared to the other treatments. BHA showed significant antioxidant effect between treatments for FFA and PV, and 25 ppm RE showed significant antioxidant effect between treatments for FFA only. DDA resulted in inhibition zones against all the tested bacteria ranging from 7.7 0.6 mm (S. enterica; weakest inhibition) to 11.8 0.4 mm (K. pneumonia; strongest inhibition). The findings showed that rosemary extract can be used as a natural antioxidant that effectively delays oxidation and exhibits antibacterial properties.										2021	28	3	554	565	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-12-Sn7568
J		Badry Mohamed, M.E.; Frag, E. Y.; Marzouk, H. A.							A validated potentiometric method for the rapid determination of chromium ions content in food samples using a portable graphite sensor.		Food Chemistry					Cr (III) has a vital role in the biological systems, and in many industrial and environmental processes, so the development of a selective, sensitive, and rapid method for its determination is a challenging goal. In this paper, an effective, selective, and inexpensive Cr (III) ions modified carbon paste electrode (MCPE) based on a simple ionophore named benazepril (BNZ) was developed and described. The proposed technique was validated using the EURACHEM guidelines. Our sensor shows a Nernstian slope of 19.200.39 mV/decade in the range of 8.0*10-6-1.0*10-1 mol L-1with a quick response time (10 s) and can be applied for the measurements for at least 54 days with negligible change in the results. The proposed sensor has a stable potentiometric response in the pH range of 2.5-6.5 and has great selectivity towards Cr (III) ions over numerous inorganic cations. The Cr (III)-BNZ surface interaction was scrutinized by a scanning electron microscope (SEM). Lastly, the proposed electrode was applied for the determination of Cr (III) ions in various food samples, and the results were compared with the results of the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES).

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate stability in ready-to-drink (RTD) green tea infusions in TiO2 and Oleic-acid-modified TiO2 polylactic acid film packaging stored under fluorescent light during refrigerated storage at 4 °C.		Foods					The light-protective effectiveness of titanium dioxide polylactic acid (TiO2 PLA) nanocomposite films (T-PLA) and oleic-acid-modified (OA_TiO2PLA) nanocomposite films was investigated in ready-to-drink (RTD) green tea infusions in oxygen-impermeable glass packaging. The stability of (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was evaluated in RTD green tea infusions in glass packaging covered with PLA (polylactic acid), T-PLA and OT-PLA under fluorescent light during 20 days of storage at 4 °C. Levels of EGCG and color change of RTD green tea infusions were determined. In addition, sensory tests for difference were conducted on green tea infusions in glass packaging without and with complete light protection during 10 days of storage at 4 °C. Of the panelists, 60% noticed sensory differences in the RTD green tea infusion in two different packaging conditions during 10 days of storage under fluorescent light by a triangle test (p< 0.05). During 20 days of storage, levels of EGCG with complete light protection decreased by 10.8% (0.73 mg/mL), and there was a 42.2% loss of EGCG (0.48 mg/mL) in RTD green tea infusions in the glass packaging covered by PLA film. Finally, 3% T-PLA preserved higher levels of EGCG in RTD green tea infusions compared to 1% T-PLA and OT-PLA. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Baenas, N.; Bravo, S.; Garcia-Alonso, F. J.; Gil, J. V.; Periago, M. J.							Changes in volatile compounds, flavour-related enzymes and lycopene in a refrigerated tomato juice during processing and storage.		European Food Research and Technology					The industrial processing and cold storage of minimally processed tomato juice might produce changes in volatile compounds responsible for the fresh tomato flavour. Many of these changes are related to the activity of the enzymes lipoxygenase (LOX) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), which are involved in the production of volatile compounds. The aim of this research was to ascertain changes in these enzymes and the major volatile compounds contributors to the fresh and green aroma attributes (aldehydes, alcohols, and lycopene volatile derivatives) in a refrigerated tomato juice, following a standardized industrial short thermal processing (96 °C, 30 s) and during refrigerated shelf-life storage (4 °C, 22 and 40 days). Results showed that, after the heat treatment, residual LOX and HPL activities were reduced in a 97% and 60%, respectively, compared to homogenized fresh tomatoes. The content of the volatile aldehydes hexanal and (Z)-3-hexenal decreased substantially from homogenized tomatoes (fresh tomato juice) to short thermal processed juice, however, (E)-2-hexenal increased probably by the action of isomerases. The content of the related alcohols, 1-hexenol and (Z)-3-hexenol, was increased with processing. The slight increase of the lycopene derived compound 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one during storage (from 0.68 to 0.73 mg L-1) could be associated with residual enzymatic activities and lycopene oxidative degradation processes, contributing positively to aroma attributes in the tomato juice. The content of lycopene in this tomato juice (27.25 mg kg-1 FW) only decreased 8% during storage. Minimizing the elapsed time from the initial tomatoes processing and the short thermal treatment is crucial to avoid volatile compounds degradation, mainly the aldehydes as the main contributors to the fresh aroma of tomato juice. The residual LOX and HPL enzymes activities should be studied in every particular case to avoid non-desirable changes in flavor-related compounds that could modify the final quality of the product. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Baerle, A.; Savcenco, A.; Tatarov, P.; Fetea, F.; Ivanova, R.; Radu, O.							Stability limits of a red Carthamin-cellulose complex as a potential food colourant.		Food & Function					This study covers aspects of stability and colouration of Carthamin-a unique red chalcone extracted from Carthamus tinctorius L. Due to its fast degradation in aqueous solutions even at room temperature, Carthamin has no significant use in the food industry. Therefore, obtaining Carthamin in a stable form is of high interest. Comparing UV-Vis spectra of Carthamin solutions and RGB-data of Carthamin-cellulose complex in the wet state showed a predominant formation of stable Carthamin conformation on the cellulose phase. It was determined that the wet Carthamin-cellulose complex acquires a stable and rich magenta colour in the pH range of 1-5. In aqueous suspensions with pH >6, the Carthamin-cellulose complex gets a purple colour, which is absolutely uncharacteristic for pure Carthamin in an aqueous solution. IR spectra indicate the fixation of Carthamin molecules on the cellulose, which presumably causes hindrance of free internal rotation of Carthamin molecules in the cellulose phase. The reduction of water activity in the cellulosic phase represents an additional stabilizing factor. As a result, the Carthamin-cellulose complex withstands heating up to 70 °C for 15 min in the pH range of 2-5, showing up to 90% of stability. These conditions are typical for the preparation of a wide range of food products. High stability in a food-like environment and magenta colour make the Carthamin-cellulose complex a prospective natural food dye. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Dysphagia management in Parkinson's disease: comparison of the effect of thickening agents on taste, aroma, and texture.		Journal of Food Science					Dysphagia is a frequent symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Thickening liquids facilitates safe swallowing, however, low treatment compliance is a major issue, due to patients' dislike of thickened liquids. Some studies suggest a negative impact of gum-based thickeners, currently most used in clinical practice, on sensory properties compared to starch-based thickeners. This has not yet been investigated in PD. This study's aim was to compare taste, texture, and aroma of gum-based and starch-based thickened soups in participants with PD. Gum-based resource thicken up clear (RTUC) and starch-based kitchen products potato starch (PS) and quinoa flour (QF) were evaluated in broccoli soup. Texture, aroma, and taste were characterized by rheology, volatile, and sensory profiling. Thickened soups were evaluated in participants with PD and controls through a paired comparison test. Reduced release of 61.4%, 46.2%, and 38.5% of volatiles was observed after thickening with RTUC, PS, and QF, respectively. Overall taste intensity was reduced in RTUC-and PS-thickened soup, respectively. Taste and aroma of PS-thickened soup were considered more intense by 70.3% and 63.8% of all participants, respectively (n=36 PD, n=41 controls), 56.3% preferred the PS-thickened soup's texture. Taste and aroma of QF-thickened soup were considered more intense by 68.1% and 65.6% of all participants, respectively (n=47 PD, n=31 controls), 58.0% preferred the QF-thickened soup's texture. Starch-based thickeners demonstrated higher taste and aroma intensity. However, volatile and sensory profiling demonstrated reduced taste and aroma in all thickeners. Combining kitchen products with flavor enhancers may increase palatability of thickened beverages. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Food Control					In 2019, a number of food companies came together in a workshop to share experiences on the use and implementation of whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in the food industry. Although the main benefits and high discriminatory power of WGS to differentiate isolates was well understood and acknowledged by participants, it was discussed that perhaps not all safety specialists in the food industry are familiar with terminologies, methodologies and interpretation of WGS technology. In order to address the knowledge gaps, a guidance document is provided here to help food safety and quality management professionals in the food industry in the understanding of WGS used for food safety. It also puts WGS in the context of other technologies used to characterize isolates and could be used as guidance to choose the appropriate technology for the intended purpose.

Nutritive manganese and zinc overdosing in aging C. elegans result in a metallothionein-mediated alteration in metal homeostasis.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Manganese (Mn) and zinc (Zn) are not only essential trace elements, but also potential exogenous risk factors for various diseases. Since the disturbed homeostasis of single metals can result in detrimental health effects, concerns have emerged regarding the consequences of excessive exposures to multiple metals, either via nutritional supplementation or parenteral nutrition. This study focuses on Mn-Zn-interactions in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) model, taking into account aspects related to aging and age-dependent neurodegeneration. Methods and Results. Chronic co-exposure of C. elegans to Mn and Zn increases metal uptake, exceeding levels of single metal exposures. Supplementation with Mn and/or Zn also leads to an age-dependent increase in metal content, a decline in overall mRNA expression, and metal co-supplementation induced expression of target genes involved in Mn and Zn homeostasis, in particular metallothionein 1 (mtl-1). Studies in transgenic worms reveal that mtl-1 played a prominent role in mediating age-and diet-dependent alterations in metal homeostasis. Metal dyshomeostasis is further induced in parkin-deficient nematodes (Parkinson's disease (PD) model), but this did not accelerate the age-dependent dopaminergic neurodegeneration. Conclusions. A nutritive overdose of Mn and Zn can alter interactions between essential metals in an aging organism, and metallothionein 1 acts as a potential protective modulator in regulating homeostasis. © 2021 The Authors.

Identification and characterization of antioxidant peptides obtained from the bioaccessible fraction of alpha-lactalbumin hydrolysate.		Journal of Food Science					Whey is an abundantand sustainable source of bioactive peptides obtained from cheese making process. Whey proteins such as alpha-lactalbumin can be biologically active when the bioactive peptides encrypted in the amino acid sequence of the native protein are released by enzymatic hydrolysis. In the present work, the identification, sequence analysis, and antioxidant activity of bioaccessible peptides from alpha-lactalbumin alcalase-hydrolysate was assessed. Antioxidant activity (ABTS, ORAC, and HORAC) of alpha-lactalbumin showed a significant increase (p< 0.05) after the enzymatic treatment with alcalase and this capacity increased even more after the simulation of the gastrointestinal digestion process. Peptides contained in the gastrointestinal digest of alpha-lactalbumin hydrolysate were separated by preparative RP-HPLC (55 fractions), and three peptides were identified by LC-MS/MS analysis from selected fractions: IWCKDDQNPH (MW: 1254.54 Da) f (59-68), KFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1439.64 Da) f (79-90), DKFLDDDLTDDIM (MW: 1554.67 Da) f (78-90). Among the chemically synthesized peptides, IWCKDDQNPH showed the highest antioxidant capacity determined by ORAC, ABTS, and HORAC assays (IC50 0.015 0.002, 0.45 0.02, and 1.30 0.05 mg/ml, respectively) and this activity may be related to the amino acid sequence. This is the first report where these bioaccessible peptides from alpha-lactalbumin hydrolysate were identified. The alpha-lactalbumin hydrolysate could be employed as a functional antioxidant ingredient. Practical Application. The present work studied the bioaccessibility of antioxidant peptides from an alpha-lactalbumin alcalase-hydrolysate by identifying three novel bioaccessible peptides responsible for the antioxidant capacity, providing evidence of the hydrolysate potential as an antioxidant ingredient in the formulations of functional foods and/or food supplements. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Thymus vulgaris traditionally used for pain management was investigated in this study for its activity on uterine contraction in the non-pregnant uterus, as a parameter for dysmenorrhea. The dried leaves of T. vulgaris were macerated in water, and the resulting aqueous extract was investigated on the isolated mouse uterus. Parameters investigated included spontaneous contractions, oxytocin-induced contractions, and high potassium chloride (KCl; 80mM)-induced tonic contractions. Mass spectrometric analysis of the thyme extract was also performed using liquid chromatography-high-resolution Fourier Transform mass spectrometry. Thyme extract inhibited the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous and oxytocin-induced uterine contractions. It also inhibited KCl-induced tonic contractions. The activities observed suggest that T. vulgaris inhibits uterine contractions through blockade of extracellular voltage-gated calcium channels. Secondary metabolites detected included compounds belonging to chlorogenic phytochemical class and flavonoids, which are known to have activities on extracellular calcium blockade. This study has shown that aqueous T. vulgaris extract, also known as thyme, inhibits contractions of the non-pregnant uterus and can be a lead plant in the drug discovery process for the management of dysmenorrhea.

J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Dornoush Jafarpour; Mohammad Jouki							Improving bioactive properties of peach juice using Lactobacillus strains fermentation: antagonistic and anti-adhesion effects, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, and Maillard reaction inhibition.		Food Chemistry					The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of Lactobacillus acidophilus PTCC 1643 and Lactobacillus fermentum PTCC 1744 against Shigella flexneri PTCC 1865 in fermented peach juice, as well as the anti-adhesion ability on epithelial Caco-2 cells. Moreover, the biological activities of peach juice were examined. We found that the studied Lactobacillus strains effectively inhibited the growth of S. flexneri during the peach juice fermentation. In addition, L. acidophilus revealed more anti-adhesion ability than L. fermentum. The inhibition of the Maillard reaction increased from 4.10% to 36.70% and 33.00% in L. acidophilus and L. fermentum treatments, respectively. Additionally, the ferrous reducing power, superoxide anion antiradical and anti-inflammatory activities of the beverage augmented during the fermentation period. These findings may be helpful for inhibition of foodborne pathogens by Lactobacillus strains and production of fruit-based fermented beverages with high functional and nutritional value.

J		Bagher Hashemi, S.M.; Aliakbar Gholamhosseinpour; Elahe Abedi							Biopreservative potential of Lactobacillus strains in yoghurt dessert.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The effects of Lactobacillus fermentum, L. helveticus, L. Reuteri and L. rhamnosus on radical scavenging activity (DPPH and ABTS), lactate concentration and antibacterial potential (against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, S. sonnei, S. aureus and B. cereus) of yoghurt dessert were investigated during fermentation (37 °C for 24 h). The amount of protein carbonyls and the peroxide and anisidine values were also examined during cold storage period (5 °C for 10 days) in order to evaluate the oxidative stability of produced samples. During the fermentation period, L. helveticus had the greatest effect on increasing the antioxidant activity (DPPH and ABTS) of samples, while the highest lactic acid concentration (22.1 g/kg) and strains viability (9.5 log CFU/g) were related to the samples fermented by L. fermentum. Lactobacillus fermentum was the most effective antipathogen strain, while the lowest antibacterial activity observed for L. rhamnosus strain. Moreover, P. aeruginosa and S. sonnei exhibited the highest and B. cereus the lowest resistance to Lactobacillus strains, respectively. During the cold storage, the viability of LAB showed an increasing trend until the fourth day and then gradually decreased by 7-11%. The oxidative stability of all fermented samples was significantly (p≤0.05) higher than that of control during the cold storage. The yoghurt dessert fermented by L. helveticus exhibited the lowest peroxide and anisidine values and the protein carbonyls concentration during the cold storage which it can be attributed to the higher antioxidant activity of this strain compared to others. It can be concluded that the Lactobacillus strains have the potential to be used as an effective biopreservation tool in yoghurt dessert production. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.										2021	15	2	1634	1643	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-020-00755-z					FSTA:2021-10-Pn5398
J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Dornoush Jafarpour							Antimicrobial and antioxidant properties of Saturn peach subjected to ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					This study was performed to investigate the effectiveness of ultrasound-assisted osmotic dehydration on reducing foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella Typhi and Shigella sonnei), as well as its impact on moisture content and antioxidant properties of Saturn peach. Peach samples were inoculated and underwent ultrasonic waves (50 and 75% amplitudes). Afterwards, the osmotic dehydration was performed by immersing the samples in 70% sucrose solution (for 4, 8 and 12 h). Results indicated that ultrasound pre-treatment markedly diminished the microbial count and the reduction levels of pathogens enhanced with the increase of ultrasound amplitude. The greatest reduction in pathogens was observed at 75% amplitude after 12 h storage in osmotic solution, in which the mean number of E. coli, E. faecalis, S. Typhi and S. sonnei was reduced to 0.1, 4.2, 3.7 and 0.1 log CFU/g, respectively. Additionally, osmotic dehydration treatment significantly reduced the amount of moisture content, total phenolics and DPPH antiradical activity of samples. It should be added that increasing the ultrasound amplitude led to a further decrease in the mentioned parameters.

J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Reza Roohi							Continuous and pulsed ultrasound treatment of barberry juice: microbial inactivation and kinetics models.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The inactivation of Escherichia coli, Salmonella Typhi, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis in barberry juice during the continuous and pulsed ultrasound treatment (100 W, 30 kHz) was simulated using the polynomial, modified Gompertz, Weibull, and biphasic linear equations. The reduction of Salmonella Typhi, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, and Enterococcus faecalis at 100% amplitude was calculated to be 5, 6, 4, and 4.9 log for continuous and 4, 5.2, 3, and 3.9 log for pulsed treatment, respectively. Results indicated that for 40% and 100% amplitudes, it was preferable to use the pulsed ultrasound, while for the amplitude of 70%, the continuous ultrasound was the best option for the inactivation process compared to the pulsed mode. It was found that the highest and lowest difference between continuous and pulsed mode occurred at the amplitude of 70% and 40%. Finally, all the used models predicted the inactivation process with sufficient accuracy. Practical applications. Traditional heating processing can change nutritional values and quality of food products. Therefore, nonthermal processing methods including high-power sonication have attracted significant interest. The inactivation of microorganisms during the sonication process can be simulated mathematically and the sonication performance can be determined. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	12			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.16083					FSTA:2022-04-Hq3191
J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Khodaei, D.							Basil seed gum edible films incorporated with Artemisia sieberi and Achillea santolina essential oils: physical, antibacterial, and antioxidant properties.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Active edible films were prepared by incorporating Artemisia sieberi and Achillea santolina essential oils (EOs) in basil seed gum (BSG) films. The results showed an increase in opacity, contact angel, and water vapor permeability of the films by the addition of EOs, whereas the moisture content, water absorption capacity, and water solubility declined. The presence of EOs significantly improved the DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activities of BSG films. The agar diffusion disc method was carried out to evaluate the antibacterial activity of the films against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella Typhi, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. BSG film containing A. santolina+ A. sieberi (1:2 v/v) demonstrated the highest antibacterial activity against the selected bacteria. It can be concluded that BSG film loaded with A. santolina + A. sieberi (1:2 v/v) EOs have the potential to be used as an active edible film and improve the shelf life of food products by delaying the oxidation and the microbial growth. Novelty impact statement. Active edible films were prepared by incorporation of Artemisia sieberi and Achillea santolina essential oils (EO) into basil seed gum (BSG) films. EOs significantly increased the opacity, water contact angel, and water vapor permeability of BSG films. Films incorporated with the mixture of EOs (A. santolina+ A. sieberi (1:2 v/v)) showed the highest antibacterial and antioxidant activities. BSG films that contained these EOs have the potential to be used as active packaging to increase the shelf life of food products. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Reza Roohi; Elahe Abedi; Mehran Sayadi							Kinetics and mathematics modeling of ochratoxin a detoxification in maize dough by Lacticaseibacillus casei subs. casei subjected to continuous and pulsed ultrasound.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The Lacticaseibacillus casei subsp. casei growth and ochratoxin A removal during fermentation of maize dough were mathematically modeled using the Baranyi and statistical models of Weibull and modified Gompertz models, respectively. The effect of important detoxification parameters including temperature level (35 and 37 °C), sonication duration (0, 5, 10 and 15 min) as well as continuous/pulsed ultrasound treatment was investigated. According to the obtained results, the utilization of the pulsed sonication can improve the performance of the conducted treatment in comparison to the continuous case for 15 min duration of sonication. However, for lower periods of sonication (i.e., 5 and 10 min), the continuous sonication was proved to be more efficient in detoxification process. It was observed 2 °C temperature increase lead to an average 4.33 g/kg reduction of the Ochratoxin A after 48 hr fermentation from the sonication. Practical applications: Microbial decontamination may give probable elimination of mycotoxins in food products under mild conditions, therefore preventive important losses in the quality of food products. Biological degradation of ochratoxin A under pulsed and continuous ultrasound was modeled. It was observed 2 °C temperature increase lead to an average 4.33 g/kg reduction of the Ochratoxin A after 48 hr fermentation from the sonication. Therefore, biological detoxification under optimal ultrasound treatment is an effective and rapid way to degrade ochratoxin A in maize dough. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	4			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15336					FSTA:2021-08-Mc4627
J		Bagher Hashemi, S. M.; Dornoush Jafarpour							Bioactive edible film based on Konjac glucomannan and probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum strains: physicochemical properties and shelf life of fresh-cut kiwis.		Journal of Food Science					This study investigates the efficacy of Lactobacillus plantarum strains (L. plantarum LP3, L. plantarum AF1, and L. plantarum LU5) incorporated into a Konjac-based edible coating in order to prevent fungi growth and retain physicochemical characteristics of fresh-cut kiwis kept at 4 °C for 5 days. For this purpose, probiotic survivability, fungi counts, decay percentage, color changes, titratable acidity (TA), total soluble solids (TSS), ascorbic acid content, chlorophyll amount, total phenolics, and DPPH radical scavenging of fresh-cut kiwis were evaluated. Results. Indicated that the population of L. plantarum strains in all treated groups retained at sufficient amounts of probiotic consumption (above 6 and 7 log CFU/g) at the end of the storage period and L. plantarum LP3 had the highest viability in comparison to other strains. The incorporation of L. plantarum in Konjac coatings markedly reduced the amount of decay and color changes and maintained the chlorophyll and ascorbic acid contents of fresh-cut kiwis compared to control samples. After 5 days of storage, total phenol content and the DPPH antiradical activities of coated kiwi slices treated with probiotics were observed about 1.2 and 10.23 g/kg compared to the pure Konjac-coated (0.84 and 7.6 g/kg) and Konjac-uncoated samples (0.44 and 4.1 g/kg), respectively. No significant difference in TSS and TA of various treatments was detected. Coated kiwi slices loaded with probiotics had higher overall acceptability compared to Konjac-coated and control samples. In addition, probiotic treatment significantly reduced mold and yeast counts compared to the control group. Practical Applications. Recently, edible films have received more consideration as a promising method to enhance the shelf life of fresh-cut fruit. The presence of probiotics in edible films reduces the growth of spoilage microorganisms and improves consumer health. Our findings encourage the application of edible coating incorporated with L. plantarum to design multifunctional foods and preserve the qualities of fresh-cut kiwifruit. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	2	513	522	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15568					FSTA:2021-05-Jg7009
J		Bagheri, N.; Al Lawati, H. A. J.; Hassanzadeh, J.							Simultaneous determination of total phenolic acids and total flavonoids in tea and honey samples using an integrated lab on a chip device.		Food Chemistry					A microfluidic device for simultaneous analysis of total flavonoids and total phenolic acids is presented for the first time. The process was based on the utilization of magnetic zinc-imidazole frameworks (ZIF-4), as a highly efficient media for on-line separation of phenolic acids and flavonoids, which were subsequently detected by a sensitive chemiluminescence (CL) method. Acrylate-based polymeric microchips containing a separation column (12.5 mm length, 3 mm width and 1 mm depth) were fabricated using a 3D-printer, and magnetic ZIF-4 was fixed into the column. The high porosity of the magnetic ZIF-4 made it a suitable adsorbent, guaranteeing an effective separation. The detection limits were in the range of 0.04-0.10 g mL-1 with relative standard deviation values of (2.19-4.38%). The system was successfully applied for the analysis of flavonoids and phenolic acids in tea and honey samples. The recovery was from 95.4 to 104.1%, indicating a good accuracy of the developed method. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bagheri Pebdeni, A.; Maryam Mousavizadegan; Morteza Hosseini							Sensitive detection of S. Aureus using aptamer- and vancomycin -copper nanoclusters as dual recognition strategy.		Food Chemistry					The proposed aptamer-and antibiotic-based dual detection sensor, combines copper nanoclusters (CuNCs) as an effective approach for the recognition and quantification of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as a pathogenic bacteria. A facile method for CuNCs based on vancomycin as the template using a fluorescence platform was proposed for the recognition of the S. aureus whole cells via antibiotic and aptamer. Using dual receptor functionalized CuNCs linked to vancomycin and a specific aptamer and during aggregation induce emission process enhanced fluorescence signal linearly with S. aureus concentrations between 102-108 CFU/mL, and the detection limit was 80 CFU/mL after 45 min As the optimum incubation time. Non-target bacteria generated negative results, proving the high specificity of the presented sensor. This strategy showed recoveries ranging 86%-98% in milk as real sample and can be used for the development of universal detection platforms for efficient and specific S. aureus detection with great potential applications for monitoring pathogenic bacteria.

J		Bahadi, M.; Ismail, A. A.; Vasseur, E.							Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy as a tool to study milk composition changes in dairy cows attributed to housing modifications to improve animal welfare.		Foods					Animal welfare status is assessed today through visual evaluations requiring an on-farm visit. A convenient alternative would be to detect cow welfare status directly in milk samples, already routinely collected for milk recording. The objective of this study was to propose a novel approach to demonstrate that Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy can detect changes in milk composition related to cows subjected to movement restriction at the tie stall with four tie-rail configurations varying in height and position (TR1, TR2, TR3 and TR4). Milk mid-infrared spectra were collected on weekly basis. Long-term average spectra were calculated for each cow using spectra collected in weeks 8-10 of treatment. Principal component analysis was applied to spectral averages and the scores of principal components (PCs) were tested for treatment effect by mixed modelling. PC7 revealed a significant treatment effect (p=0.01), particularly for TR3 (configuration with restricted movement) vs. TR1 (recommended configuration) (p=0.03). The loading spectrum of PC7 revealed high loadings at wavenumbers that could be assigned to biomarkers related to negative energy balance, such as beta-hydroxybutyrate, citrate and acetone. This observation suggests that TR3 might have been restrictive for cows to access feed. Milk FTIR spectroscopy showed promising results in detecting welfare status and housing conditions in dairy cows. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bahareh Arabpoor; Shima Yousefi; Weria Weisany; Mehran Ghasemlou							Multifunctional coating composed of Eryngium campestre L. essential oil encapsulated in nano-chitosan to prolong the shelf-life of fresh cherry fruits.		Food Hydrocolloids					This study aims to fabricate Eryngium campestre essential oil (ECEO) encapsulated chitosan nanoparticles (CHNPs) through an ion gelation method. The resultant CHNP-ECEO dispersions were characterized in terms of particle size, zeta potential and polydispersity index. To extend the shelf-life of sweet cherries, we have coated a thin layer of CHNP-ECEO on the surface of the fruits. The cherries coated with various concentrations of encapsulated ECEO, were assessed for their physicochemical characteristics (weight loss, pH, titratable acidity, respiration rate, firmness, antioxidant activity, and total phenolic contents) and microbial growth during the 21 days storage at 4 °C. The results showed a significant reduction of the microbial counts for all CHNP-ECEO coated cherries throughout the experiment. Besides, all CHNP-ECEO coated cherries exhibited a reduced titratable acid and weight loss compared to the control whereas the pH, firmness, total phenolic contents and antioxidant activity were changed in reverse direction and moderately increased. In conclusion, the coatings composed of CHNPs and ECEO were demonstrated to be efficient in controlling the microbial growth of the cherries and can be comparably applied for other types of fruits with similar compositions.

Food Bioscience					The health-promoting characteristics of garlic essential oil have been studied for many years. However, the intensive odor has restricted its consumption. The capability of beta-cyclodextrin (beta-CD) incorporation with sugar beet pectin was evaluated in the garlic oil encapsulation process. The highest encapsulation and production efficiencies were obtained for the samples with 3:6-1:2 and 1:6-1:2 of core: wall material and sugar beet pectin: beta-CD ratios, respectively. The scanning electron microscopic images revealed some jags, and especially surface wrinkles on the surface of the samples. The differential scanning calorimetry results showed that the encapsulation process improved the thermal stability of garlic oil. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy spectrum showed that the garlic oil was physically entrapped in the beta-CD cavity. Applying the sample with the highest level of sulfur content to a gastrointestinal tract model system and an acidic food environment and also studying the physicochemical and release behavior showed the potential of sugar beet pectin as a wall material for garlic essential oil in acidic systems.

J		Bahareh Salemi; Naser Sedaghat; Mohammad Javad Varidi; Seyed Mahmoud Mousavi; Farideh Tabatabaei Yazdi							The combined impact of calcium lactate with cysteine pretreatment and perforation-mediated modified atmosphere packaging on quality preservation of fresh-cut "Romaine" lettuce.		Journal of Food Science					The effect of perforation-mediated modified atmosphere packaging (PM-MAP) in combination with calcium lactate (1.5% CaL) and cysteine (0.1, 0.5% Cys) immersion pretreatments on the quality preservation of fresh-cut "Romaine" lettuce was assessed for 12 days, at 5 and 10 °C. The shredded lettuce was packed in low-density polyethylene films (LDPE, 62 m thickness), including different perforation numbers of 0 (N-MAP), 20 (20-PM-MAP, Diameter = 64 m), and 40 (40-PM-MAP, Diameter = 64m) per in square meter. Indices of quality maintenance were investigated. The total microbial counts were below the specified limits for ready-to-eat vegetables (< 6 log CFU/g) considering both pretreated 20-PM-MAP and N-MAP samples on day 12. After 8 days, a significant difference (P< 0.05) was observed in the browning index (BI), the total color difference (DeltaE), and the chlorophyll content between N-MAP and 20-PM-MAP samples with better results in 20-PM-MA packages. At 10 °C, the BI in pretreated 20-PM-MAP samples was 32.44% to 58.35% less than N-MAP samples, on the last day of storage. The 20-PM-MAP samples pretreated with 1.5% CaL/0.5% Cys had the highest (P< 0.05) crispness coefficient and water content values. It seems that packaging the pretreated lettuce in 20-PM-MA packages is more effective for maintaining the visual properties (green fresh appearance) of this product, from the 8th to the 12th day of storage. Practical Application. The medium to high respiration rate of fresh-cut lettuce causes O2 level drops below its tolerance limit (<1% to 3%) inside the modified atmosphere packaging (MAP). It results in severe browning, off-odors, off-flavor, and growth of anaerobiosis. Perforated-mediated modified atmosphere packaging (PM-MAP) technology can be introduced as an alternative to a nonperforated MAP system (conventional MAP) for fresh-cut lettuce. The application of the PM-MAP system in combination with calcium lactate and cysteine immersion pretreatment (CaL/Cys) may lead to better maintenance of the physicochemical properties of this product. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	3	715	723	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15619					FSTA:2021-07-Jq8390

Mechanical disintegration and particle size sieving of Chondrus crispus (Irish Moss) gametophytes and their effect on carrageenan and phycoerythrin extraction.		Foods					To better understand the migration properties of hybrid carrageenan from the seaweed tissue during carrageenan extraction, the effect of increasing the seaweed surface area by the mechanical disintegration of gametophyte Chondrus crispus chips was studied under various temperature and time extraction conditions. Dried Chondrus crispus seaweed chips were milled by a rotor beater mill and classified into eight different size fractions by sieving with varying mesh sizes from 50 to 2000 mum. During extraction at 22 °C, the red color of the filtrate increased significantly with the decreasing particle size of the fraction, correlating with the increasing phycoerythrin concentration (from 0.26 mg PE/g dry seaweed in the >2000 mum size fraction to 2.30 mg PE/g dry seaweed in the <50 mum size fraction). On the other hand, under the same extraction conditions, only a small increase in carrageenan precipitate was obtained with the decreasing size fractions (from no recovery in the >2000 mum size fraction to 2.1 0.1 g/kg filtrate in the <50 mum size fraction). This yield was significantly lower than the ones from extractions at 45 °C (5.4 0.1 g/kg) or at 90 °C (9.9 2.1 g/kg) for the same particle size and time conditions. It could be concluded that hybrid carrageenan extraction is not surface area dependent, while phycoerythrin is. Therefore, it seems that phycoerythrin and carrageenan extraction follow different mechanisms. This creates potential for the selective extraction of each of those two compounds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Development of two specific multiplex qPCRs to determine amounts of Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Brochothrix thermosphacta and Staphylococcus in meat and heat-treated meat products.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Culturing methods are conventionally applied to investigate the contamination of food with several microorganisms after heat processing. However, with these methods, it is not possible to evaluate whether heat-treated meat products, such as cooked sausages, contained parts of spoiled meat. Therefore, two specific multiplex qPCRs were developed in this study in order to determine the microbiological quality of the raw materials used for these products. The PCR targets focused on four bacterial groups often found on meat (family Enterobacteriaceae, genus Pseudomonas, genus Staphylococcus and species Brochothrix thermosphacta). Specificity as well as sensitivity of the developed multiplex qPCRs, validated by using 68 microbial species, were 100%. The applicability of both multiplex qPCRs compared to culturing methods was performed using 96 meat samples (fresh and naturally spoiled) and 12 inhouse-made "Lyoner" sausages containing variable ratios of spoiled meat (0%, 5%, 12% and 25%; n=3 for each group). Both methods showed similar results by evaluating the Deltalog10 cfu/g, the relative accuracy and the t-test analysis (p> 0.05). Comparing qPCR results of the different sausage groups, a significant difference between sausages containing fresh meat and sausages containing spoiled meat (12% and 25%) was found only for Pseudomonas and B. thermosphacta in both raw and cooked sausages. The statistical difference between 5% vs. 12% and 25% spoiled meat in cooked sausages, was also found only for these two bacterial groups. The developed multiplex qPCRs were further applied to 30 commercially available "Bologna-type" sausages. The results showed a total of 14 sausages considered to be suspicious for Food Fraud. While the role of Staphylococcus spp. In meat spoilage remains unclear, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteriaceae and B. thermosphacta could together be used as an indicator for "spoiled meat" used in sausages. The developed qPCR systems in this study allow the detection of four relevant bacterial groups in the heated Bologna-type sausages and provide information about the hygienic quality of raw materials used. This method could thus be helpful for screening food suspected of Food Fraud. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bahni Dhar; Majumdar, R. K.; Balange, A. K.; Sanath H. Kumar; Nayak, B. B.							Controlled degradation of protein and fat during fermentation of pangas (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus).		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The utilization of underpriced fish pangas (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) through salt fermentation was investigated. The fish was salt fermented, and its biochemical, sensory, and other quality characteristics determined for 180 days. Moisture and salt contents of the product toward the end of fermentation maintained at 54.34 and 16.54%, respectively, while the pH had dropped to 5.34. The first phase of fermentation continued up to 120 days where rapid changes in salt, pH, protein, and lipid degradation products were seen. This was followed by a stabilization phase till 150th day with minimal changes followed by the maturation stage where flavor components improved and many parameters were more stable than in the stabilization phase at the end. Slow increase in fat and protein degradation products like thiobarbituric acid (TBA), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN), free fatty acid (FFA), and peroxide value (PV) indicated controlled degradation of the macromolecules. At the end of 6 months of salt fermentation, product stability was found to be a result of hurdle effects of unfavorable intrinsic parameters. Practical applications. Application of salt curing on pangas will give new dimension to value addition of the fish and can make ways for better utilization and value realization of the underpriced fish. This could raise interest among the pangas growers for more production. The salt fermentation of pangas masks the original fatty flavor of the raw fish after fermentation and results in fermented flavor. This salt fermentation process could surely enhance the saleability value of pangas which can serve as an alternative to highly priced salt-fermented hilsa in India and Bangladesh. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	9			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15635					FSTA:2022-01-Rc0038
J		Bai Qu; Jingyi Xue; Yangchao Luo							Self-assembled caseinate-laponite nanocomposites for curcumin delivery.		Food Chemistry					In this study, novel self-assembled protein-clay nanocomposites were developed for curcumin delivery. Experimentally, curcumin was dissolved and deprotonated in sodium caseinate-laponite (NaCas-LAP) dispersion at pH 12.0 for 30 min followed by neutralization to pH = 7. Due to the pH-mediated dissociation and re-association process, curcumin was successfully encapsulated into NaCas-LAP nanocomposites. The colloidal properties and encapsulation capabilities of NaCas-LAP nanocomposites were investigated, including particle size, zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, release profile in simulated gastrointestinal tract, as well as nanoscale morphology. The results indicated that upon neutralization, NaCas-LAP nanocomposites were re-associated into smaller particles due to strong hydrophobic interactions among NaCas, LAP and curcumin. Specifically, 0.10% curcumin loaded nanocomposites prepared with 2% NaCas and 0.5% LAP showed improved encapsulation performance (73.4%) with smaller particle size (100 nm). The as-prepared protein-clay nanocomposites hold promising potential to deliver lipophilic bioactive compounds, such as curcumin.

J		Bai, Y.; Alemu, R.; Block, S. A.; Headey, D.; Masters, W. A.							Cost and affordability of nutritious diets at retail prices: evidence from 177 countries.		Food Policy					Many policies and programs aim to bring nutritious diets within reach of the poor. This paper uses retail prices and nutrient composition for 671 foods and beverages to compute the daily cost of essential nutrients required for an active and healthy life in 177 countries around the world. We compare this minimum cost of nutrient adequacy with the subsistence cost of dietary energy and per-capita spending on all goods and services, to identify stylized facts about how diet cost and affordability relate to economic development and nutrition outcomes. On average, the most affordable nutrient adequate diet exceeds the cost of adequate energy by a factor of 2.66, costing US$1.35 per day to meet median requirements of healthy adult women in 2011. Affordability is lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The sensitivity of diet costs to each requirement reveals the high cost of staying within acceptable macronutrient ranges, particularly the upper limit for carbohydrates. Among micronutrients, total diet costs are most sensitive to requirements for calcium as well as vitamins A, C, E, B12, folate and riboflavin. On average, about 5% of dietary energy in the least-cost nutrient adequate diets is derived from animal source foods, with small quantities of meat and fish. Over 70% of all animal products in least-cost diets is eggs and dairy, but only in upper-middle and high-income countries. In lower income countries where egg and dairy prices are significantly higher, they are replaced by larger volumes of vegetal foods. When controlling for national income, diet costs are most significantly correlated with rural travel times and rural electrification. These data suggest opportunities for targeted policies and programs that reduce market prices and the cost of nutritious diets, while improving affordability through nutrition assistance, safety nets and higher earnings among low-income households.

Sensory profiling, liking and acceptance of sea urchin gonads from the North Atlantic coast of Portugal, aiming future aquaculture applications.		Food Research International					Sea urchin gonads are receiving increasing attention for their exclusive sensorial attributes. However, the sensory profile of this highly demanded gourmet product has not yet been well described, and it may potentially help enhancing the gonads" marketability and acceptability. The main goal of this study was to build a sensory profile of sea urchin (Paracentrotus lividus) gonads, to evaluate differences between sex, harvest location, as well as the impact of presentation on consumer acceptance. Sixty untrained panellists (regular consumers of seafood) were asked to evaluate eight samples of raw sea urchin gonads, divided by sex, harvest location and presentation (in a clear translucent glass bowl or inside a sea urchin test). The panellists evaluated overall liking and acceptance (Food Action Scale), followed by a Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) ballot with a list of 38 sensory attributes divided into four dimensions: appearance (9), odour (8), texture (7) and taste (14), launched in Sense Gest. From a three-way ANOVA, no significant effect of sex, harvest location and presentation were identified for both liking and acceptance. However, a significant interaction between presentation and sex was identified: females with gourmet presentation were rated higher than females presented in a bowl; and males presented in a bowl were favoured in relation to gourmet presentation. Sensory profiling clearly separates gonads according to sex, with females being more appealing than males that presented a milky white fluid. Gonads were also separated according to the presentation method: the white background of the bowl seemed to highlight the orange colour of females; the gourmet presentation favoured the females in relation to the males, mainly because the male gonad colour and white-colour exudate were emphasized by the background of the sea urchin test. Moreover, the gourmet presentation in both sexes was correlated with a fresh, tropical and pleasant odour. This study concluded that sea urchin with an orange gonad and a sweet, fresh and tropical flavour is preferable, which will allow future nutritional research efforts to be focused on the enhancement of these gonad attributes.

J		Baifen Huang; Zengxuan Cai; Jingshun Zhang; Jiaojiao Xu							An efficient solid-phase extraction-based liquid chromatography method to simultaneously determine diastereomers alpha-tocopherol, other tocols, and retinol isomers in infant formula.		Journal of Food Quality					The separation and simultaneous quantitation of diastereomers of DL-alpha-tocopherol, eight tocol forms, and retinols (trans and cis) have been conducted by reversed-phase liquid chromatography followed by solid-phase extraction. A chiral silica stationary phase modified with polysaccharide derivative on the monodisperse macroporous silica gel (Unichiral OD-5H column, 150mm*4.6mm, 5mum, NanoMicro Technology Co., Ltd.) was employed for eluting each target compound. Instead of conventional solvent extract, a green and eco-friendly solid-phase extraction column, packing with nonpolar polystyrene divinylbenzene, was optimized in terms of capacity and solvent used in steps. Validation of the method was examined and confirmed to be satisfactory, with excellent linearity regression (r>0.9999), acceptable accuracy (74.66%~112.92%), and precision (0.20%~10.52%) results. Limit of detection ranged from 0.05mg. Kg-1 (retinols) to 0.4mg. Kg-1 (tocols). The method was checked by infant formula reference material SRM 1849a as well, which illustrated good agreement of mass fraction with certified value and enriched the important isomer data.

Insect protein concentrates from Mexican edible insects: structural and functional characterization.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Industrial valorization of proteins from traditional edible insects requires knowledge of their nutritional, chemical, technological characteristics. Therefore, these characteristics in two Mexican edible insects (A. cordifera and B. mellifica) were studied and compared to commercial insect species (H. illucens). The nutritional attributes of insect protein concentrates (PCs) were determined by their protein content, amino acid and polyphenol compositions. The chemical structure of the proteins was determined by Fourier-Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC). Moreover, the surfactant properties of insect-PC (emulsions) were evaluated. B. mellifica PC showed the highest content of protein content among the studied insects (57.1%). In contrast, H. illucens showed the highest polyphenols (12.7 mg/g). The emulsions prepared with insect-PC from A. cordifera and B. mellifica showed higher stability than H. illucens, where a bigger droplet size and a rapid phase separation occurred. The decrease in emulsification properties of black soldier fly larvae was attributed to a possible interaction between polyphenols and proteins that hinders emulsification. This study increases the understanding of the structural and techno-functional characteristics of insect-PC of commercial and local insect species. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

A comparative study of polyphenolic and amino acid profiles of commercial fruit beers.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The individual polyphenols, free amino acid (AA) profiles, and pigments (beta-carotene and monomeric anthocyanins) concentration of twenty-nine commercial beers were quantified. Additionally, a physicochemical characterization consisting of density, °Brix, color, and% alcohol content (ABV), was performed. The ABV ranged from 2 to 9%, °Brix from 2 to 12, and a broad color spectrum, ranging from yellow (4°SRM) to black (39°SRM) was observed. Total free amino acids (TAA) content ranged from 49-3,902mg/L. The concentrations of nineteen quantified polyphenols ranged between 4-298mg/L, being catechin (38-298mg/L) and epicatechin (19-354mg/L) the most abundant compounds, while the pigments content ranged between 4-35mg/L. The observed differences were mainly attributed to the brewing style as well as the type and amount of added fruit. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed five different groups for polyphenols, pigments, and AA related to their chemical structure. This allowed clustering samples according to the proportion in which each category contributed to the total phenolic+pigments content or TAA. It was noted that "Fruit Lambic" beers were the only brewing style that showed similar trends in the performed analysis. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food & Function					Obesity is closely associated with maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to systemic lipid metabolism disorders. Zeaxanthin (ZEA) is a kind of carotenoid with potent antioxidant activity and has been reported to promote mitochondrial biogenesis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism has not been explained. In this study, we first discovered that ZEA stimulated 3T3-L1 adipocyte browning by increasing the expression of specific markers (Cd137, Tbx1, Sirt1, Cidea, Ucp1, Tmem26, and Cited1), thereby reducing lipid accumulation. Besides, ZEA promoted mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing the expression of PRDM16, UCP1, NRF2, PGC-1alpha, and SIRT1. Moreover, the uncoupled oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of protons leaked in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was rapidly increased by ZEA treatment, which improved mitochondrial respiration and energy metabolism. Furthermore, we found that ZEA promotes browning by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis partly through the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. This study provided new insight into the promotion of browning and mitochondrial biogenesis by ZEA, suggesting that ZEA probably has potential therapeutic effects on obesity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	14	6283	6293	2042-650X				10.1039/d1fo00524c					FSTA:2021-11-Aj16160
J		Baimin Wu; Jiechao Liu; Wenbo Yang; Qiang Zhang; Zhengyan Yang; Hui Liu; Zhenzhen Lv; Chunling Zhang; Zhonggao Jiao							Nutritional and flavor properties of grape juice as affected by fermentation with lactic acid bacteria.		International Journal of Food Properties					Two lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains of Lactobacillus plantarum 21802 and Lactobacillus brevis 6239 were selected and combined for fermentation of grape juice. The changes of sugars, organic acids, volatiles, phenolic compounds as well as antioxidant capacity of the grape juice were characterized. Results showed that fermentation with LAB led to a slight decrease in sugar content and increased in organic acid content. The sugars were mainly consumed at the initial stage of fermentation, while the malic acid was consumed completely during the fermentation. The contents of total phenolics and flavonoids in grape juice decreased gradually during the fermentation process. As compared with the initial contents in unfermented grape juice, the contents of proanthocyanin B2, rutin, isoquercitrin, rhamnose-3-O-glucoside in the final fermented grape juice were increased by 26.83%, 249.24%, 138.48%, 139.60%, respectively, while the contents of gallic acid, proanthocyanin B1, catechin and epicatechin were decreased by 24.49%, 14.85%, 71.68%, 42.52%, respectively. The mice fed with the fermented grape juice showed higher activity of superoxide dismutase and lower level of malondialdehyde both in serum and liver tissue than those fed with the unfermented grape juice. Fermentation with LAB also enhanced the flavor profile by increasing the total number and content of volatile compounds, especially those of monoterpene alcohols, which are the main and characteristic aroma volatile compounds in Muscat aroma grapes. This research confirmed that fermentation with LAB might be a desirable option for improving the flavor and nutritional attributes of grape juice by altering the ratio of sugar to organic acid, improving the phenolic compounds, enhancing the antioxidant capacity, intensifying of the characteristic aroma and pleasant flavor of the grape juice.

International Food Research Journal					The present work aimed to investigate the effect of a newly proposed mixture of quinoa seeds and tiger nuts (QTM) (1:1) on low-fat beef patties. The chemical composition, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidant activity of QTM were determined. The chemical composition, water-holding capacity, cooking loss, and sensory evaluation of low-fat beef patties prepared with 10% QTM as a partial fat replacer were also studied. Microbiological quality of frozen minced meat semi-finished products (burger patties, at -18 °C) for 126 days was also determined. Based on the results, QTM contained 14.35% lipid, 9.37% protein, and 11.38% dietary fibre. Moreover, QTM also contained good amount of minerals and vitamins. The antioxidant activity of QTM was 20.41 mg/g. Results also showed that the addition of QTM had a positive effect on the sensorial quality of beef patties. Chemical composition, water-holding capacity, cooking loss, and pH profiles of newly formulated burger patties significantly improved following the addition of 10% QTM as a partial fat replacer. During the storage of semi-finished products, thiobarbituric values showed that the newly formulated beef patties had a lower level of lipid oxidation as compared to control. With lower microbial loads and lipid oxidation, the shelf life of the newly formulated beef patties also significantly increased as compared to control. As the conclusion, QTM could be applied as a functional component in meat products.

J		Bairagi, S.; Gustafson, C. R.; Custodio, M. C.; Ynion, J.; Demont, M.							What drives consumer demand for packaged rice? Evidence from South and Southeast Asia.		Food Control					The demand for improved packaging and labeling of rice is expected to rise in Asia due to rapid income growth, growing food safety concerns, and retail market transformation. Currently, about half of the rice in urban markets in South and Southeast Asia is sold in packaged form. However, urban market shares of packaged rice are highly heterogeneous among countries and range from 11% in the Philippines to 18% in Vietnam, 45% in India, 51% in Indonesia, 58% in Cambodia, 63% in Bangladesh, and up to 64% in Thailand. We identify the drivers of consumer demand for packaged rice by fitting a probit model on survey data from more than 4000 urban and rural consumers from seven countries in South and Southeast Asia. The results indicate that demand for packaged rice is driven by income, education, employment, household size, intrinsic quality attributes such as rice fragrance, per capita rice consumption and purchase frequency. The drivers of demand are found to depend on the stage of retail market transformation, distinguishing Thailand as a market leader from the rest of the countries in South and Southeast Asia. The findings in this study can help policymakers learn from more advanced countries and rice sectors in South and Southeast Asia and develop country-specific strategies to foster modernization and inclusiveness of rice retail markets consistent with their sectors' state of progress in retail transformation.

J		Baiyu Zhang; Mengmeng Liu; Gang Liu; Dan Li; Benhong Zhou							Oral absorption mechanism of the polysaccharides from Gastrodia elata Blume base on fluorescence labeling.		Food Research International					The mechanisms of action of polysaccharides in vivo have been widely elucidated. However, the systematic research of its absorption and transport mechanisms remains unclear. Herein, we extracted a polysaccharide fraction (GEP) from Gastrodia elata by water extraction and alcohol precipitation and aimed to reveal its oral absorption processes through animal models and Caco-2 cells monolayer models. Our research data showed that GEP-Cy5.5 could be absorbed through the small intestine and the main absorption intestinal segment was the ileum (the absorption rate constant [Ka]: (3.64 0.70) * 10-4 cm/s; the effective apparent permeability [Papp value]: (4.88 1.02) * 10-5 cm/s). The ligated intestinal loops also revealed that GEP-Cy5.5 could pass through the villi of the small intestine and the mucosal barrier into the submucosa. Furthermore, GEP-Cy5.5 was readily absorbed into the blood through the gastrointestinal tract, then distributed in the liver and the kidney. The Papp value of in vitro transport study was (1.29 0.08) * 10-6 cm/s, which was a time-dependent process. Notably, GEP-Cy5.5 was transported through the endocytosis process mediated by clathrin and macropinocytosis. The underlying absorptive mechanisms of GEP in vivo and in vitro were clarified, which provided the guidance for clinical medicine administration and could deepen the biological understanding of oral polysaccharides.

The impact of replacing wheat flour with cellular legume powder on starch bioaccessibility, glycaemic response and bread roll quality: a double-blind randomised controlled trial in healthy participants.		Food Hydrocolloids					The global rise in obesity and type 2 diabetes has generated significant interest in regulating the glycaemic impact of staple foods. Wheat breads (white or wholemeal) are popular staples, but have a high-glycaemic index, due to the highly digestible wheat starch. Reducing the glycaemic potency of white bread is challenging because the bread-making conditions are mostly conducive to starch gelatinisation. Cellular legume powders are a new source of type 1 resistant starch, where the starch is encapsulated by dietary fibre in the form of intact plant cell walls. The starch in these cell powders is less susceptible to gelatinisation and digestion than starch in conventional legume flours. However, legume cell resilience to baking conditions and the effects of this ingredient on glycaemic responses and product quality are unknown. Here we show that the integrity of cell wall fibre in chickpea powder was preserved on baking and this led to a ~40% reduction in in vivo glycaemic responses (iAUC120) to white bread rolls (~50 g available carbohydrate and 12 g wheat protein per serving) when 30% or 60% (w/w) of the wheat flour was replaced with intact cell powder. Significant reductions in glycaemic responses were achieved without adverse effects on bread texture, appearance or palatability. Starch digestibility analysis and microscopy confirmed the importance of cell integrity in attenuating glycaemic responses. Alternative processing methods that preserve cell integrity are a new, promising way to provide healthier low glycaemic staple foods; we anticipate that this will improve dietary options for diabetes care.

Food Science and Technology Research					This study aimed to use an existing ligand (imidazole)-assisted 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy protocol to determine sulfate content of seaweed sulfated saccharides. Twenty seaweed samples-spanning nine species and multiple geographic locations-were analyzed. Extracts were obtained by immersing freeze-dried seaweeds in boiling water, followed by alginate precipitation. Remaining supernatants contained natural crude polysaccharide (CP) fraction, including sulfated polysaccharides. To eliminate free CP carboxy groups that can interfere with the complex formation of imidazole with CP sulfate groups, the carboxy groups were chemically reduced to hydroxymethyl groups prior to 1H-NMR spectroscopy. Resultant sulfate content estimates were comparable to those obtained via a conventional barium-rhodizonate assay. Findings indicate that the imidazole-assisted 1H-NMR spectroscopy is an appropriate method for estimation of seaweed CP sulfate content.										2021	27	3	505	510	1344-6606				10.3136/fstr.27.505					FSTA:2022-01-Rg0193
J		Bak, K. H.; Richards, M. P.							Hexanal as a predictor of development of oxidation flavor in cured and uncured deli meat products as affected by natural antioxidants.		Foods					Effectiveness of commercial natural antioxidants from rosemary and green tea were investigated in deli-style meat products via headspace hexanal by solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography and sensory oxidation flavor by a trained panel at weeks 1, 7, and 13 of refrigerated storage. A water/oil-soluble rosemary extract at 400 mg/kg proved the most effective antioxidant in cured deli turkey (CDT). In chicken fillet (CF), a water-soluble rosemary extract at 400 mg/kg was most efficient, especially in combination with phosphate. In pulled pork (PP), none of the antioxidants were as efficient as phosphate, though all three tested antioxidants were moderately effective in PP without phosphate. Nitrite was such an efficient antioxidant on its own in CDT that hexanal levels were so low that it was not possible to build correlation models between headspace hexanal and sensory oxidation flavor throughout the storage period. Phosphate also proved very efficient on its own in both CF and PP. It was possible to build good correlation models throughout storage for both CF and PP. Hence, hexanal was found to satisfactorily predict development of oxidation flavor in different types of uncured deli meat products both with and without added phosphate. © 2021 by the authors.

Flavor characterization of animal hydrolysates and potential of glucosamine in flavor modulation.		Foods					Bovine (meat and heart) and porcine (hemoglobin and plasma) raw materials were hydrolyzed by Protease A (both endo-and exopeptidase activity), with or without glucosamine added during the enzyme inactivation step. Hydrolysates were characterized via peptide analysis (yield, UV-and fluorescence scanning spectroscopy, and peptide size distribution via size exclusion chromatography), sensory evaluation, and volatile compound analysis via gas chromatography mass-spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine if glucosamine-induced Maillard reaction improved taste and flavor. Porcine hemoglobin produced the most flavor-neutral hydrolysate, and could expectedly have the broadest application in food products. Both bovine meat and-heart hydrolysates were high in umami, and thereby good candidates for savory applications. Porcine plasma hydrolysate was high in liver flavor and would be suitable for addition to certain meat products where liver flavor is desirable. All hydrolysates had low perceived bitterness. Glucosamine-induced Maillard reaction had just a minor influence on the sensory profile via an increased perception of sweet taste (p = 0.038), umami taste (p = 0.042), and yolk flavor (p = 0.038) in the hydrolysates, irrespective of raw material. Glucosamine addition had a statistically significant effect on 13 of 69 volatiles detected in the hydrolysates, but the effect was minor and raw material-specific. © 2021 by the authors.

A study was conducted using four different yeast fractions of either autolysed or high-pressure homogeniser (HPH)-crushed yeast biomasses of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Brettanomyces bruxellensis. Near-infrared spectroscopy (FT-NIR) coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used and analysed by principal component analysis (PCA). The FT-NIR spectral region of Saccharomyces and Brettanomyces statistically analysed by PCA showed a clear discrimination accounting for 76% of the variation in the data for PC1; moreover, yeast hulls prepared from the same strain and subjected to two different treatments were also separated. These methods classify yeast cell hulls (YCH) according to strain, composition and treatment applied. Our results indicate that yeast hulls obtained by autolysis are less rich in proteins than those resulting from HPH treatment due to the high pressure that releases more proteins and exposes them on the surface of the cell wall. The composition of YCH at the extreme surface is similar to that found deeper in the wall. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Bakhtawar Naseer; Sanaullah Iqbal; Namrah Wahid; Jamshaid Qazi, H.; Muhammad Nadeem; Muhammad Nawaz							Evaluation of antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of rutin in combination with butylated hydroxytoluene in cheddar cheese.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The objective was to evaluate the preservative potential of rutin in combination with butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) in cheese. Cheddar cheese was prepared with various combinations of rutin (10-60 ppm) and BHT (60-240 ppm) along with positive (200 ppm BHT) and a negative control. Tests for antioxidant, storage stability, microbiological and sensory evaluation were performed at 0,30, 60, and 90 days. Two-way analysis of variance was applied at p<.05 followed by a post hoc test. Rutin in combination with BHT has significant effect on total phenolic contents and antioxidant activity in linoleic acid at all concentrations. Dose-dependent significant impact on lipolysis, microbiological stability and sensory attributes, flavor, taste, and overall acceptability was observed when compared with control, however, it has no effect on color. It can be concluded that low doses of rutin (40 ppm) with BHT (180 ppm) can increase cheddar cheese stability without adverse effect on sensory attributes. Practical applications. It is always needed to explore natural food preservatives to minimize the use of chemicals due to their adverse health effects. This study shows that rutin can be utilized as natural preservative in cheese as well as can be evaluated in other dairy and bakery products. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	1			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15046					FSTA:2021-05-Pj2781
J		Bakir, B. O.; Cebioglu, I. K.; Gunalan, E.; Bilgin, G. D.							The association of fat preference with eating behavior and sex: Turkish version of the Fat Preference Questionnaire©.		Food Science & Nutrition					The fat content of food may play a role in food preferences. Increased fat intake has a role in elevated body weight. Firstly, we aimed to establish the Turkish version of the Fat Preference Questionnaire© and secondly to evaluate the relevant factors with dietary fat preference including body mass index (BMI); sex; and subscales of the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ). The study was conducted with 261 participants among the academic staff of Yeditepe University. The Fat Preference Questionnaire© and TFEQ were applied. After the validity and reliability of the Turkish version of the Fat Preference Questionnaire©, Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated to reveal the relationship between the scores of the Fat Preference Questionnaire©, BMI, and the four subscales of TFEQ. Weakly or moderately correlated variables were selected to perform two sets of hierarchical regression analyses. Turkish version of the Fat Preference Questionnaire© had statistically acceptable validity and reliability. Fat preference did not correlate with BMI (p>.05). Women showed a lower preference for high-fat foods and a higher dietary fat restriction (p<.05). The two subscales of TFEQ, the Disinhibition of Eating Control and the Susceptibility to Hunger, contributed to explain the variances in fat preference and dietary fat restriction (Delta R2 =.04, p<.05). Fat preference correlates with Disinhibition of Eating Control and Susceptibility to Hunger, while fat restriction correlates only with Disinhibition of Eating Control although none correlates with BMI. Turkish version of the Fat Preference Questionnaire© is a valid instrument for further studies. © 2021 The Authors. Food Science & Nutrition published by Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bakir, C. H.; Drury, T.; Kent, G. A.							A factory experiment to assess different shredder-hammer configurations.		International Sugar Journal					Shredding is critically important to maximising the amount of pol extracted from the supplied cane by the milling tandem or diffuser Whilst modern shredders typically achieve high levels of preparation (greater than 85 POC), they also use considerable energy, have high maintenance costs and produce much noise. An experiment was undertaken at Rocky Point Mill during the 2016, 2017 and 2018 seasons to evaluate the effect of shredder-hammer configuration on shredder performance in terms of POC, windage, noise, hammer wear rates and hammer-tip wear rates. Two hammer configurations were tested: a conventional checkerboard configuration (114 hammers) and an "Alternative 1" configuration (152 hammers). The results showed that, although there were 33% more hammers in the "Alternative 1" configuration, the POC was surprisingly lower at 87 compared to 88 for the conventional configuration. Furthermore, the mean specific power, noise levels and windage were slightly higher for the "Alternative 1" hammer configuration. The wear rate for the hammers and hammer tips were ~40% and ~68% higher in the Alternative 1' configuration, respectively.

J		Bakker, C.; Underwood, K.; Grubbs, J. K.; Blair, A.							Low-voltage electrical stimulation of beef carcasses slows carcass chilling rate and improves steak color.		Foods					Electrical stimulation (ES) is used in beef slaughter plants to improve tenderness; however, varying levels of low-voltage ES have not been well characterized. The objective was to evaluate the influence of two levels of low-voltage ES on temperature decline, pH, glycolytic potential, and meat quality. Forty-two beef carcasses were chosen from a commercial packing facility. One side of each carcass received either 40 or 80 volts of ES for 60 s at 45 min postmortem. The paired side of each carcass did not receive ES (Control). Temperature loggers were placed in the sirloin of 12 carcasses to record temperature decline. Longissimus muscle pH was measured at 1, 12, and 24 h, and 3 d postmortem. Strip steaks were fabricated for determination of meat quality. A treatment by time interaction was observed for carcass temperature decline (p< 0.001) where ES sides stayed warmer longer than Control sides. A treatment by time interaction was observed for pH decline with Control sides exhibiting an increased pH at 1 h postmortem (p< 0.001). Instrumental color values were increased for ES compared to Control sides (p< 0.001). These results indicate ES slows carcass temperature decline, hastens initial pH decline, and improves instrumental color. Similar results were observed between the ES treatments indicating either ES level may be used to achieve similar quality characteristics. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Impact of feeding cover crop forage containing brassicas to steers during backgrounding on palatability attributes of beef strip steaks.		Foods					Brassica cover crops have been widely used for improving soil health and as a feed resource for grazing cows, but their use in backgrounding diets is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of feeding a brassica cover crop mixture during backgrounding on beef palatability. Thirty steers were assigned to one of two dietary treatments during backgrounding with (1) ad libitum access to freshly cut brassica cover crop forage (CC) containing radish, turnip, rapeseed, and rye grass, or (2) common Midwestern dry lot backgrounding diet (CON). The steers were transitioned to a common finishing diet after backgrounding. Striploins were collected after harvest, and were analyzed for evaluation of the Warner-Bratzler shear force (WBSF), collagen content, autolysis of calpain-1, proteolysis of desmin, and troponin-T; in addition, the tenderness, juiciness, and flavor evaluated by a trained sensory panel. A treatment x day interaction was observed for WBSF (p=0.02). Steaks from the CON diet were less tender than CC steaks on days 3 and 7, but did not differ on days 14 and 21. Feeding a brassica mixture cover crop during the backgrounding phase of production did not impact the collagen content, autolysis of calpain-1, or proteolysis of desmin and troponin-T. Thus, additional investigation into the mechanisms responsible for the differences observed in instrumental tenderness is warranted. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bakour, M.; Laaroussi, H.; Ousaaid, D.; Oumokhtar, B.; Lyoussi, B.							Antioxidant and antibacterial effects of pollen extracts on human multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.		Journal of Food Quality					The present work was designed to search the possible antibacterial effect of the ethanolic extract of pollens from six botanical origins, Punica granatum, Quercus ilex, Centaurium erythraea, Coriandrum sativum, Ruta graveolens, and Citrus aurantium, against multidrug pathogenic bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The content of phenolic compounds, flavones, and flavonols was measured. The antioxidant activities were evaluated using four assays: total antioxidant capacity, DPPH, ABTS, and reducing power. Antibacterial activity was studied using the agar disk diffusion method, and the MIC and MBC were determined. Results obtained showed a positive correlation between the antioxidant content of pollen extracts and the antibacterial capacity, Punica granatum and Quercus ilex pollen extracts were the most efficient against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and Centaurium erythraea, Coriandrum sativum, and Ruta graveolens had a moderate effect, while Citrus aurantium had no antibacterial effect. It is concluded that pollens can be a good source of bioactive molecules that exhibit potent antioxidant effects and strong antibacterial activities. Copyright © 2021 Meryem Bakour et al.

J		Bakr Shori, A.; Chia Hong, Y.; Salihin Baba, A.							Proteolytic profile, angiotensin-I converting enzyme inhibitory activity and sensory evaluation of Codonopsis pilosula and fish collagen cheese.		Food Research International					Four types of cheeses were prepared included plain-cheese (control), Codonopsis pilosula (CP)-cheese, plain-cheese with fish collagen (FC; control) and CP-cheese with FC. The effects of cheese samples on acidification, proteolysis of milk proteins using three methods (cadmium-ninhydrin method, O-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) assay, and electrophoresis assay), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory activity were investigated during 0,2, & 4 weeks of ripening. In addition, the sensory evaluation was also investigated during 0,2, 4, & 8 weeks of ripening. The presence of FC in CP-cheese increased the numbers of free amino acids (FAA) at 0 and 2 weeks. The addition of CP both in the presence and absence of FC affected positively (p < 0.05) on the concentrations of OPA peptide in cheese compared to their respective controls. The presence of CP and/or FC in cheese increased the degradation of milk proteins (alpha-, beta-, & kappa-caseins, beta-lactoglobulin, and alpha-lactalbumin) compared to their respective controls during ripening periods. The highest ACE inhibitory activity was shown at 4 weeks of ripening for CP-cheese both in the absence (67.7514.15%) and the presence (78.652.85%) of FC. In addition, 8-week-old CP-cheese in the presence and absence of fish collagen had similar organoleptic characteristics to plain-cheese. In conclusion, C. pilosula and/or fish collagen may lead to the development in the production and formulation of cheese with anti-ACE activity.

J		Bakr Shori, A.; Yap Huey Ling; Salihin Baba, A.							Effects of Lycium barbarum and fish collagen in cheese on the proteolytic degradation profile with anti-ACE activity.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of L. barbarum (LB) and/or fish collagen (FC) in cheese on the proteolytic degradation profile with anti-ACE activity were investigated. Four types of cheeses were made plain cheese (control), LB -cheese, FC-cheese (control), and LB-cheese+ FC. Acidification of cheese, milk proteins proteolysis, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity was performed for 28 days. The OPA peptides content of LB -cheese was higher (p<.05) than control on 28 days. The addition of FC in LB -cheese improved OPA peptides' content. The proteins degradation of beta-lactoglobulin, alpha-and beta-caseins increased in the presence of LB in cheese whereas alpha-and beta-caseins degradation improved in LB+ FC cheese. ACE inhibitory activity was decreased (p<.05) in LB-cheese but not in LB+ FC. The combination of LB and FC in cheese showed the most enhancements on the production of peptides that may act as an anti-ACE activity. Novelty impact statement: ACE inhibitory peptides from cheese could be considered as a potential approach for use in nutraceuticals for the prevention and management of hypertension. People have a high demand to consume functional dairy products and there are big opportunities for the functional dairy market, this has driven the cheese industry to the development of commercial new products in the market. L. barbarum and fish collagen contain significant amounts of biologically active compounds that can be formulated into cheese to provide health properties such as anti-ACE activity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	3			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15239					FSTA:2021-07-Pj3476
J		Bal, E.							Effect of melatonin treatments on biochemical quality and postharvest life of nectarines.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The study investigated the effects of melatonin on the postharvest quality of nectarine fruit (cv. Fantasia). Fruits were dipped in melatonin concentrations (control, 250,500 and 1000 mol l-1) and stored for 40 days at 0-1 °C and 85-90% relative humidity. Changes in weight loss, respiration rate, fruit firmness, total soluble solids, titratable acidity, chilling injury, ascorbic acid, total flavonoids, total phenolics and total antioxidants were evaluated during 0,10, 20,30 and 40 day. According to the results, melatonin treatments effectively slowed process of senescence, as indicated by reduced fruit softening, chilling injury and respiration rate. Moreover, this effect is concentration-dependent, with 1000 mol l-1 melatonin treatment more effective than other doses during the 40 days of storage. Melatonin treated nectarines exhibited higher total antioxidant activity than controls, which was correlated primarily to the high levels of total phenolics and to lesser loss to ascorbic acid and flavonoids contents. These results demonstrated that melatonin treatment could be a good practice for extending postharvest life of nectarine fruits, maintaining the appearance and nutrient value, and reducing the loss of health-promoting compounds. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Development and characterization of active native and cross-linked pearl millet starch-based film loaded with fenugreek oil.		Foods					In this study, cross-linked pearl millet starch and fenugreek oil was used to develop active starch edible films to overcome the limitations of native starch and to substitute artificial preservatives with natural one. The starch was cross-linked at three levels (1%, 3% and 5%) using sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP), and physicochemical properties were studied. Moreover, a comparative study was conducted among four samples of films prepared using native starch, cross-linked starch, and native and cross-linked starch loaded with fenugreek oil for physical, thermal, mechanical, morphological, and antibacterial properties. The solubility, swelling, and amylose content of native and modified starch varied from 11.25-12.75%, 12.91-15.10g/g, and 8.97-16.55%, respectively. The values of these parameters were reduced as the concentration of STMP increased. Cross-linked starch films showed lower moisture, solubility, water vapor permeability (WVP), and elongation at break (EB) values while having higher thickness, opacity, thermal, and tensile strength values. The microscopic images of cross-linked starch films showed smooth surfaces and the absence of ridges, pores, and cracks. The films loaded with fenugreek oil showed different results; the moisture content, water solubility, and tensile strength were decreased while thickness, opacity, WVP, and EB were increased. The onset temperature and peak temperature were lower, while enthalpy of gelatinization was increased to a greater extent than films without oil. The addition of fenugreek oil to films showed a good inhibition area of 40.22% for native + oil films and 41.53% for cross-linked + oil films % against Escherichia coli. This study confirmed the successful utilization of fenugreek oil as a very effective antimicrobial agent in preparing edible films. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Balaban, M.; Koc, C.; Sar, T.; Akbas, M. Y.							Antibiofilm effects of pomegranate peel extracts against B. cereus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, the antibacterial and antibiofilm properties of pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) extracts (PPLs) prepared by 10 g of pomegranate peels (PPL10) and 100 mL of different solvents (ethanol, methanol, and their acid combinations, and water) were investigated as sources of bioactive compounds against food-related bacteria. The antimicrobial activities of the extracts were measured by using agar well diffusion assay. The acid-treated extracts exhibited the highest antimicrobial activities (31-34 mm). The biofilm formations were assessed by using a microplate reader (570 nm) after crystal violet staining. The prevention and removal of bacterial biofilms were also evaluated by using extracts prepared by 5 g of initial pomegranate peel (PPL5) with the different solvents or 200 ppm chlorine solution. All PPL5 and PPL10 extracts diluted at different ratios inhibited and removed biofilms, and the highest antibiofilm effects were up to 80% by acid-treated extracts. In addition, PPL5s and PPL10s were as effective as or more effective than chlorine for the prevention of biofilms. Therefore, from an economical perspective the PPL5s could represent promising candidates as natural antibiofilm agents for food industry. © 2021 The Authors.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					Theoretical and experimental studies were conducted to determine the role of 1-MCP in the biosynthesis of ethylene in cape gooseberry fruits (Physalis peruviana L.), ecotype Colombia. A completely randomized experimental design was used with 3 treatments: ethylene (1000 muL ethephon L-1), 1-MCP (1 muL L-1), and a control with no applications. At 1,6 and 11 days after treatment, volatile compounds, firmness and color were measured. The enzymatic activities of ACC oxidase (E. C. 1.14.17.4) and histidine kinase (HK, E. C. 2.7.13.3) were also determined in vitro. Subsequently, molecular docking studies with the enzymes, their respective substrates and 1-MCP were carried out. It was found that 1-MCP decreased the emission of volatile esters, color index, loss of firmness, and ACC oxidase and histidine kinase activities. Results. Indicated 1-MCP acted as a competitive inhibitor of ACC oxidase and as a noncompetitive inhibitor of HK. The coupling free energy was higher for 1-MCP in both the ACC oxidase (8.31) and the HK (4.22), compared to their respective substrates. The results also suggested that 1-MCP was able to decrease both the biosynthesis and activity of ethylene in cape gooseberry fruits. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Balakrishna Konduru; Sreerohini Sagi; Manmohan Parida							Dry reagent-based multiplex real-time PCR assays for specific identification of chicken, mutton, beef and pork in raw and processed meat products.		European Food Research and Technology					DNA-based methods are more reliable than the conventional protein-based techniques and have been applied to species identification in food of animal origin and meat fraud detection. We developed and evaluated dry reagent-based real-time PCR assays for identification of four commonly eaten meat species. A set of species-specific primers and probes were designed targeting transforming growth factor beta-3 (TGFB3), prolactin receptor (PRLR), NADH dehydrogenase (ND5), and beta actin (ACTB) genes to differentiate chicken, mutton, beef and pork, respectively. All the real-time PCR reagents along with the primers and probes were lyophilized into a pellet form in the presence of suitable stabilizers. The assay specificity was tested with the DNA of animal species other than the target species and also with plant species. The assay was found to be sensitive down to 0.002 ng of DNA from each target species. Thermostability studies of lyophilized mix showed that it was stable for 90 days at room temperature and 120 days at 4 °C. When the method was applied for the analysis of commercial meat samples (n=66), the results showed that seven samples contained non-declared meat components. The developed assay has the potential to monitor routine meat species identification from raw and cooked meat products and the method can also be implemented in food-testing laboratories. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	3	737	746	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-020-03662-1					FSTA:2021-06-Sa3310

Enhanced absorption of curcuminoids and 3-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid from fenugreek galactomannan hydrogel beadlets: a natural approach to the co-delivery of lipophilic phytonutrients.		Journal of Functional Foods					Simultaneous oral delivery of bioactive molecules with enhanced bioavailability is of great significance, especially when delivered from single beadlets. Here, we report the formulation, characterization, and pharmacokinetic properties of two poorly bioavailable lipophilic phytonutrients with synergistic effects, curcuminoids and 3-Acetyl-11-keto-beta-boswellic acid (AKBA), following their co-delivery using fenugreek dietary fiber (Galactomannans)-based hydrogel beadlets (CGM-BSW). These beadlets are capable of extensive swelling and sustained-release of self-emulsified colloidal particles (150-200nm) containing curcuminoids and AKBA allowing for improved absorption. The results of our double-blinded 4-way crossover, 4-sequence study (n=14) demonstrated that a single dose of 250mg of these beadlets enhanced the absorption of unconjugated curcuminoids (24.8-fold) and AKBA (6.9-fold) compared to their unformulated counterparts. The absorption of CGM-BSW formulated curcuminoids was also 5.6-fold higher than that of those formulated with turmerones (UCT). UPLC-ESI-QQQ-MS/MS was used to quantify both the curcuminoids and AKBA concentration in the plasma samples and this data was used to determine their pharmacokinetic characteristics.

J		Balakrishnan Arutselvy; Gunasekaran Rajeswari; Jacob, S.							Sequential valorization strategies for dairy wastewater and water hyacinth to produce fuel and fertilizer.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					To overcome the obstacles of treatment of dairy wastewater (DW) under anaerobic mono-digestion and sustainable disposal of harvested water hyacinth (WH) a novel sequential valorization strategy was adopted to obtain fuel and fertilizer. Initially, DW and WH were subjected for anaerobic co-digestion to elucidate the synergistic effect of the substrates to improve the process efficiency and increased biomethane production. The results indicated that the co-digestion mixture (DW: WH-1:1) has resulted in biomethane yield of 504.38L/Kg VSfed which is 1.28-fold and 3.14-fold higher as compared to the mono-digestion of WH (431.71L/Kg VSfed) and DW (160.59L/Kg VSfed), respectively. Further, the residual digestate was subjected for slow pyrolysis (32015 °C) to obtain bio-oil and biochar. The obtained bio-oil shown superior fuel characteristics as compared to direct WH bio-oil resulting in density, viscosity, and calorific value of 1.210.04 g/ml, 1.80.05 cSt and 1766.8211.53KJ/Kg, respectively. The biochar residue from pyrolysis was amended to the soil to determine its bio-fertilizing property. The soil properties in terms of bulk density, porosity, organic carbon, and pH were enhanced. Tomato cultivation in biochar amended soil shown comparable vegetative growth to that of digestate and urea thereby advocating the replacement of chemical fertilizers. Practical Application. With recent increase in environmental concerns and requirement to meet the prescribed limits for effluent discharge from the industries, especially from food processing for the protection of aquatic bodies, there is a requirement of adoption of cost effective technology that could provide both economic and ecological sustainability. In this study, a sequential valorization strategy was adopted for efficient management of dairy wastewater and harvested water hyacinth from the water resources. The resultant products biogas, bio-oil and biochar could be potentially used as fuel and fertilizer. Circular bio-economy is in need of time which could be attainable by the implementation of such strategies in large scale industries for efficient waste management and resource recovery. This will not only benefit the environment but also to the society by galvanizing the sustainable development technology. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	2			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13585					FSTA:2021-06-Pa2911

S.; Anjineyulu Kothakota							Microencapsulation of bixin pigment by spray drying: evaluation of characteristics.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The present work was conducted to microencapsulate the commercial (CE), and solvent (SE) extracted annatto using modified starch (MS) and gelatine (G) blend as wall material by spray drying. The conditions used were solid: liquid (S/L) ratio 1:10, extraction temperature 70 °C, and extraction time interval (10-35 min) for the SE annatto extract. Among the different treatments, 20 min extraction time was highly significant in the recovery of 93.190.06 g/100 g of annatto seeds of total pigment and 94.780.89% of bixin recovery. Both SE and CE annatto extracts have been used as a core material with wall materials (MS: G) in varied ratios of 100:0 to 60:40 to produce the microcapsules. The highest encapsulation efficiency of 86.18% and 86.37% were recorded for the SE and CE microcapsules prepared with the wall material (MS: G) ratio of 60:40. Encapsulated extract recorded higher stability against light, oxygen, and heat than the non-encapsulated annatto. In vitro release study of both microcapsules in three different pH conditions (1.2, 6.8, and 7.4) revealed an initial burst release of bixin pigment followed by a controlled release of bixin from microcapsules.

J		Balalzadeh Tafti, M. H.; Reza Eshaghi, M.; Peyman Rajaei							A smart meat packaging to show ciprofloxacin residues based on immunochromatography.		Meat Science					The aim of this study was to design a novel smart packaging based on immunochromatography to show ciprofloxacin residues in beef meat. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and precision of this smart packaging were 97%, 100%, 100%, and 97%, respectively. The minimum diagnostic concentration and the minimum diagnostic time were 25 mug/kg and 1 min, respectively. Also, intra- and inter-assays showed all assays were all identical. This means that the smart packaging was a stable and reproducible tool for ciprofloxacin analysis. It is recommended that this type of smart packaging be designed, analyzed, and used to show the residues of common antibiotics in the livestock industry. It is hoped that by obtaining the necessary permits and relevant approvals, this type of packaging can be used for the export and import of various types of meat.

Production of wheat flour/PBAT active films incorporated with oregano oil microparticles and its application in fresh pastry conservation.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					This study aimed to produce wheat flour and poly (butylene co-terephthalate adipate) films with the addition of free and microencapsulated oregano essential oil by blown extrusion and to evaluate its applicability as an active packaging in the preservation of the Brazilian fresh pastry, known as Pastel. The oregano essential oil microparticles were produced by spray drying and characterized in terms of morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and mean diameter. In the films, the physical, antioxidant, and diffusion kinetics of oregano essential oil were determined. Films with microencapsulated oregano essential oil showed lower tensile strength and Young's modulus and higher elongation, solubility, antioxidant capacity, and diffusion coefficient when compared to the control and free oregano oil films. During 28 days of refrigerated storage, fresh pastry packaged with film with oregano essential oil microparticles presented a lower count of molds and yeasts, compared to pastries packed with control and free oregano oil films. The microencapsulation protected oregano essential oil from extrusion condition shearing and temperature damages during film production, allowing the development of biodegradable active films for application in foods where contamination by molds and yeasts is predominant. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Balaso Watharkar, R.; Sourav Chakraborty; Prakash Srivastav, P.; Brijesh Srivastava							Physicochemical and mechanical properties during storage-cum maturity stages of raw harvested wild banana (Musa balbisiana, BB).		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					The changes in various physicochemical and mechanical properties after harvesting wild banana (Musa balbisiana) were investigated by storing the fruit at room temperature (222 °C). During ripening, physical changes such as pulp to peel ratio and fruit with seed to peel ratio increased and the changes in the colour of the fruits from green to red while yellowness occurred in the peel. The maximum colour difference (DeltaE) of pulp and peel increased up to the 5th stage and decreased thereafter. Textural softening occurred till the end of the ripening stages; the peak force of penetration decreased from 16.6 to 5.8 N for banana samples with the peel. At the end of ripening, a non-significant difference was observed that may be due to equalized mucilaginous peel tissue structure. During the ripening process, moisture content, titratable acidity, pectin, fat, total sugar, pH and the total soluble solids were increased, and decreased starch content, ascorbic acid and protein were observed. The sensory assessment at the 6th stage of the banana received the highest rating. Thus, the present study determined the best ripening stage of wild banana variety to be suitable for processing during the postharvest phase and quality control of processed products. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	4	3336	3349	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00907-9					FSTA:2021-12-Jg17159
J		Balaso Watharkar, R.; Sourav Chakraborty; Prakash Srivastav, P.; Brijesh Srivastava							Foaming and foam mat drying characteristics of ripe banana [Musa balbisiana (BB)] pulp.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Foam-mat drying characteristics of wild ripe banana [Musa balbisiana (BB)] pulp on the attributes of the product were investigated. The effects of pulp concentration (PC), skim milk powder (SMP) and whipping time (WT) on foaming characteristics such as foam density, drainage volume and foam expansion were studied. The obtained optimum condition for the foaming process was 9.62°Brix of PC, 8.18% of SMP, and 145.54s of WT. The hot air drying of banana foam was carried out at 50-70°C; the drying rate and moisture diffusivity (3.9-5.9 * 10-10 m2/s) increased with drying temperature. The physico-chemical properties of banana foam powder such as moisture content, water activity, bulk density, and Carr index decreased with an increase in drying temperature, whereas hygroscopicity, water solubility index, and water absorption index increased. The dried samples were moderately bright in color and had a porous microstructure. The present study is expected to be useful in the preparation of banana powder. Practical Applications. Foam-mat drying technology is a pragmatic method to dry fruit juices and pulps. The concept behind the foam-mat drying is an increase in the surface area of material to be dried. The process depends on the material property of pulp/juice and the use of the additives to create a foam structure and ensuring its stability during the phase of drying to offer granular products having low bulk density. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	8			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13726					FSTA:2021-11-Jg15556

In vitro antibacterial and antibiofilm activity of hungarian honeys against respiratory tract bacteria.		Foods					Honey is a rich source of carbohydrates, while minor compounds such as amino acids and polyphenols contribute to its health-promoting effects. Honey is one of the oldest traditional remedies applied for microbial infections, due to its antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial and antibiofilm effects of Hungarian black locust, linden, and sunflower honeys against the most common biofilm-forming respiratory tract pathogens Haemophilus spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The unifloral character of all three honey types was confirmed by melissopalynological analysis. The antibacterial activity of each honey sample against each bacterium strain was proven with agar well diffusion assay and thin layer chromatography-direct bioautography. Kinetics and mechanisms of antibacterial action were clarified with time-kill assay and membrane degradation study. The anti-biofilm activity was evidenced using crystal violet assay. In each assay, linden honey was the most effective, followed by sunflower and black locust honey. In addition, each honey sample had greater potential to suppress respiratory tract bacteria, compared to major sugar components. In conclusion, honey in general and linden honey in particular, can have a role in the treatment of respiratory tract infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Baldelli, A.; Wells, S.; Anubhav Pratap-Singh							Impact of product formulation on spray-dried microencapsulated zinc for food fortification.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Different types of zinc compounds were successfully encapsulated using the technique of spray drying. Maltodextrin, pea proteins, and titanium dioxide were the materials used as bulk materials. We investigated the effect of the total solids weight percentage and the ratios between different components (zinc to maltodextrin, zinc to protein, zinc to titanium dioxide, and protein to maltodextrin) on zinc bioavailability, assessed at various times points in an in vitro digestion. The following formulation characteristics were found to produce encapsulated zinc microcapsules with highest bioavailability (up to 85%): a zinc oxide to maltodextrin ratio of 0.3, a weight percentage of 9, and a maltodextrin to pea protein ratio of 3. Other types of zinc compounds, citrate, gluconate, sulfate, carbonate, and chloride produce an average bioavailability of 45%. A small addition of the ratio zinc and titanium dioxide of 2.2 causes a decrease in zinc bioavailability of about 25%. These spray-dried microparticles containing encapsulated iron can be used for food fortification with the purpose of treating iron deficiency. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	14	12	2286	2301	1935-5149				10.1007/s11947-021-02721-z					FSTA:2022-04-Aj5310
J		Baldi, G.; D'Elia, F.; Soglia, F.; Tappi, S.; Petracci, M.; Rocculi, P.	Elia, F. d'						Exploring the effect of pulsed electric fields on the technological properties of chicken meat.		Foods					Pulsed electric field (PEF) is a non-thermal technology which is increasingly drawing the interest of the meat industry. This study aimed at evaluating the effect of PEF on the main technological properties of chicken meat, by investigating the role of the most relevant process parameters such as the number of pulses (150 vs. 300 and 450 vs. 600) and the electric field strength (0.60 vs. 1.20 kV/cm). Results indicated that PEF does not exert any effect on meat pH and just slightly affects lightness and yellowness. Low-intensity PEF treatments improved the water holding capacity of chicken meat by significantly (p< 0.001) reducing drip loss up to 28.5% during 4 days of refrigerated storage, without damaging proteins' integrity and functionality. Moreover, from the analysis of the process parameters, it has been possible to highlight that increasing the number of pulses is more effective in reducing meat drip loss rather than doubling the electric field strengths. From an industrial point of view, the results of this explorative study suggested the potential of PEF to reduce the undesired liquid inside the package, thus improving consumer acceptance. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Baldi, L.; Trentinaglia, M. T.; Mancuso, T.; Peri, M.							Attitude toward environmental protection and toward nature: how do they shape consumer behaviour for a sustainable tomato?		Food Quality and Preference					Several research efforts have tried to explain the forces driving food-related decisions. In this article, we explore how individual attitude toward the environment could be a potential determinant of green behavior. This research offers an original methodological framework never adopted in the food consumption domain that is based on the contribution of Campbell Paradigm and the related advancements on attitude measures proposed by the environmental psychology literature. We also contribute to the literature by envisaging a two-dimensional environmental attitude, that distinguishes between attitude toward environmental protection and toward nature appreciation. The ultimate target is to explain consumer purchasing intentions, represented by Willingness to Pay, toward a hypothetical tomato with improved resource use efficiency taking into account consumer psycho-attitudinal propensity towards environmental issues. The analysis is conducted in Italy and in the UK, two countries characterized by different perceptions about tomato as a consumption good and about water related issues. Findings indicate that the two dimensions of consumer attitude affect differently the spending propensity for a sustainable tomato and these differences are also country-specific. The analysis suggests that policies aimed at promoting sustainable food products should also target the consumer type (naturalist or environmentalist) that is more sensible to environmental sustainability.

Evaluation of the combined effect of temperature and potassium sorbate on physicochemical and microbial quality of modified atmosphere packaged sliced Mozzarella cheese.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed to evaluate the influence of storage (5 °C) and abuse (15 °C) temperatures and the addition of potassium sorbate (PS) on different quality attributes of modified atmosphere packaged (MAP) sliced Mozzarella cheese. It was observed that the temperature affected more significantly the cheese properties than the addition of PS in sliced MAP cheese. After 15 and 45 days of storage, the pH has decreased and the acidity has increased at 15 °C. The instrumental color parameters were practically temperature and PS independent. Empirical equations that estimate the kinetics of change of the quality attributes in terms of the temperature, storage time, and PS were derived. Regarding the microbiological quality, the psychrotrophic bacterial population continued to grow during the storage independently on the treatment. Depending on the treatment adopted, LAB, yeasts and molds, and Escherichia coli population decreased during the period of 75 days of storage. Practical applications. The results obtained in the current study provide a quantitative evaluation of the influence of these independent variables on cheese quality. Empirical equations that estimate the rate of changes in the physicochemical and microbiological parameters were derived and can be used to evaluate the shelf life of sliced MAP Mozzarella cheese subjected to different storage conditions. Such information can help consumers and industry to optimize storage parameters of the product. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Baldus, M.; Heukaeufer, F.; Grosspietsch, C.; Methner, F. J.							Accumulation of hydrogen peroxide in barley seeds - a key factor for malt quality?		Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists					Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a reactive oxygen species that contributes to undesired oxidation of barley ingredients that are crucial for beer production and quality. H2O2 reveals a dual role in plant physiology as it is involved in oxidative damage of biomolecules, but also actively synthesized for growth regulating processes. As H2O2 formation in barley and its consequences for malt quality have not been investigated before, a method for H2O2 quantification throughout malting is presented in this work to investigate this pathway's potential involvement in oxidative reactions in malt production. During germination, H2O2 steadily accumulated in the barley seeds reaching concentrations up to approximately 2.5mol/g (dm). Barley variety, aeration rate, as well as water content during steeping were significant impact factors for H2O2 formation. H2O2 strongly correlated with the barley acrospire lengths indicating its beneficial involvement in growth regulation. During withering and kilning, the majority of H2O2 was exponentially degraded. It is proposed that after its controlled synthesis during germination, H2O2 acts as a primary oxidant of malt ingredients during withering and kilning. The barley metabolism-derived H2O2 accumulation is discussed in relation to oxidative stability of malt, wort, and beer. The data of this work can be used as a fundament to control oxidative damage during malting. © 2021 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.										2021	79	4	384	393	0361-0470				10.1080/03610470.2020.1865247					FSTA:2022-01-Hc0726
J		Balejko, E.; Balejko, J.							Use of a highly antioxidant diet in the regulation of adipose tissue secretion in patients after the BIB procedure.		Foods					Obesity is a global problem. The secretory activity of adipose tissue causes inflammation and disturbs metabolic parameters. Low-invasive bariatric procedures are an alternative to surgical treatment, especially in individuals who do not qualify for surgery or in whom conservative treatment does not bring the expected results. The diets designed for bariatric patients contained an increased proportion of bioflavonoids. The dietary components were carefully selected to provide anti-inflammatory effects. The experimental diets showed an antioxidant capacity (TEAC) of 433-969 M TE/100 g or 100 mL, reducing ability (FRAP) of 13-58 M TE/100 g or 100 mL, and total polyphenol content of 80-250 mg catechins/100 g or 100 mL. Lower levels of adipocytokines were obtained in the blood of patients following the diet. The results of the present study showed the participation of some adipocytokines in the regulation of energy homeostasis, lipid metabolism, glucose level, blood pressure and inflammation. Diet therapy should yield positive results in the long term, with the possibility of using immune modulation in personalized therapy for metabolic syndrome. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Blended meat/plant products are capturing industry market space at the retail counter for value-added beef products. Plant protein ingredients can be added to meat formulations to create appealing and functional products. Ground beef was combined with one of three plant protein inclusion treatments: control, pea, oat, or rice, along with 5% textured vegetable protein (TVP) and 1.5% soy protein concentrate then formed into 226 g patties containing up to 10% plant-based proteins. Patties were analyzed for fresh and cooked characteristics throughout a 5- or 7-day retail display. The inclusion of plant-based proteins negatively affected the instrumental tenderness values which were greater (p< 0.01) in plant-inclusion patties compared to the control patties. The inclusion of plant proteins increased (p = 0.01) the cooking yield of patties compared to the control. Cooking time was longer (p = 0.04) for oat patties compared to the control patties. Cooked color values for vegetable inclusion patties did not affect (p = 0.12) lightness (CIE L*) values; however, redness (CIE a*) was greater (p< 0.01) for rice than all other treatments and yellowness (CIE b*) values were greater (p< 0.01) for all protein treatments compared to the control. Rice improved (p< 0.01) fresh a* values on day 5 of display compared to the control; whereas pea decreased (p = 0.04) values compared to the control. There was a treatment * day interaction (p< 0.01) on lipid oxidation values with a reduction in values on day 3 for all vegetable proteins compared to the control and on day 7 lipid oxidation was reduced (p ≤ 0.03) for oat patties. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					The consumer acceptance of alternative plant-focused ingredients within the meat industry is growing globally. Oat protein is insoluble and used to increase product yield and fat retention. Furthermore, inclusion of oat protein can provide manufacturers another option for extending beef supplies. As the consumer diet shifts for improvements in nutritional density, oat protein is an alternative ingredient that lacks information on inclusion in a ground beef formulation. Coarse ground beef was allocated to one of four treatments, mixed with oat protein (0%, 1.5%, 3.5% and 4.5%), water, salt, pepper, textured vegetable protein, soy protein concentrate, and sodium tripolyphosphate. Meat blocks (n = 3 batches) were finely ground and formed into patties (N = 65/treatment). Patties were placed onto an expanded polystyrene tray, overwrapped with polyvinyl chloride film and displayed for 7 days. Instrumental color (L*, a*, and b*) decreased throughout simulated display (p = 0.0001). Increased usage rates of oat protein in patties resulted in greater cook yields (p = 0.0001). Objective measures of Allo-Kramer shear force values increased as oat protein inclusion rates increased (p = 0.0001). Oat protein can be incorporated in ground beef patties with positive effects on cook yield, but inclusion rate may have a deleterious impact on color and instrumental tenderness. © 2021 by the authors.

Cytotoxic activity and genotoxicity of antioxidant WPC-hydrolysates and their probiotics compatibility as Potential Functional Feed Additive.		Food Bioscience					Whey protein concentrate (WPC) is produced in large quantities by dairy industry. The enzymatic hydrolysis of WPC can produce antioxidant peptides and therefore, the dairy industry can develop functional additives based on its own products. In a previous work, antioxidant peptides produced by the trypsin hydrolysis of WPC 35 shown strong antioxidant activity. In the present work, micronucleus and comet assay tests were conducted in order to measure DNA damages produced by WPC-hydrolysates previously reported. Furthermore, cytotoxicity was determined in Vero C-76 and IEC-18 cells, while cell morphology was visualized using confocal microscopy. Tests conducted in vitro and in vivo revealed that WPC-hydrolysates at its active concentration had low toxicity and high biocompatibility. At the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in which cyto-and genotoxicity studies of WPC-hydrolysates were performed, providing in-depth insight into the toxicity of such new ingredients. Furthermore, the WPC-hydrolysates did not show antimicrobial activity against pathogens and present compatibility with different probiotic microorganisms such as lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. All the information presented here, is of great importance in order to reach a big goal which consist in the production of novel functional feed additives based on antioxidant peptides and probiotics.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Within the last decade, quinoa seeds have gained much popularity as a new food and have recently been proposed as an appropriate food for early introduction in infants. Quinoa contains high levels of saponins, which are known for their adjuvant activity and effect on the intestinal barrier function. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of quinoa on intestinal permeability and inflammation in comparison with the positive controls; cholera toxin (CT), and capsaicin. Methods and results. The effect of quinoa on intestinal barrier function and inflammation is investigated in vitro using a Caco-2 cell line and in vivo using a Brown Norway rat model. Effects in vivo are analyzed by protein uptake, histology, gene expression, antibody levels, and flow cytometry. Quinoa and the positive controls all increased the intestinal permeability, but distinct patterns of absorbed protein are observed in the epithelium, Peyer's patches, lamina propria, and serum. The quinoa-mediated effect on intestinal barrier function is found to be distinct from the effect of the two positive controls. Conclusion. The findings demonstrate the ability of quinoa to increase intestinal permeability and to promote compartment-specific protein uptake via mechanisms that may differ from CT and capsaicin. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Acid hydrolysis of gluten enhances the skin sensitizing potential and drives diversification of IgE reactivity to unmodified gluten proteins.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Personal care products containing hydrolyzed gluten have been linked to spontaneous sensitization through the skin, however the impact of the hydrolysate characteristics on the sensitizing capacity is generally unknown. Methods and Results. The physicochemical properties of five different wheat-derived gluten products (one unmodified, one enzyme hydrolyzed, and three acid hydrolyzed) are investigated, and the skin sensitizing capacity is determined in allergy-prone Brown Norway rats. Acid hydrolyzed gluten products exhibited the strongest intrinsic sensitizing capacity via the skin. All hydrolyzed gluten products induced cross-reactivity to unmodified gluten in the absence of oral tolerance to wheat, but were unable to break tolerance in animals on a wheat-containing diet. Still, the degree of deamidation in acid hydrolyzed products is associated with product-specific sensitization in wheat tolerant rats. Sensitization to acid hydrolyzed gluten products is associated with a more diverse IgE reactivity profile to unmodified gluten proteins compared to sensitization induced by unmodified gluten or enzyme hydrolyzed gluten. Conclusion. Acid hydrolysis enhances the skin sensitizing capacity of gluten and drives IgE reactivity to more gluten proteins. This property of acid hydrolyzed gluten may be related to the degree of product deamidation, and could be a strong trigger of wheat allergy in susceptible individuals. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

Determination of changes in physicochemical and sensory characteristics of purple passion fruit with the application of different packaging systems, including an ethylene scavenger additive.		Journal of Food Science					To achieve a suitable packaging configuration, it is important first to determine the physicochemical characteristics related to the packaged product. In this study, the physicochemical characterization of fresh purple passion fruits of three different ripening stages was carried out to determine key variables for the packaging, such as O2 consumption and CO2-ethylene production rates. Subsequently, intermediate-ripe fruits were packaged for 21 days at 6 °C under three packaging conditions: Xtend perforated bags, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags, and LDPE bags with a novel ethylene scavenger active additive (ESAA). It was observed that an equilibrium modified atmosphere was formed in the packages. For the Xtend bags, the highest values of O2 (yo2=0.184 to 0.192) and lowest of CO2 (yco2=0.033 to 0.041) were reached, whereas for the LDPE bags with ESAA these values were moderate. In the case of ethylene, the LDPE bags showed the highest levels in the headspace (26 to 31 ppm), whereas the lowest levels were obtained in the LDPE bags with additive (2 to 4 ppm). These levels resulted in a delay in the ripening of the fruits during storage, which was verified through a sensory acceptability test that was carried out on the juice extracted from the fruits. In this sensory test, panelists identified similar characteristics between the fruits packaged with ESAA and the Xtend bags, regarding the control fruits. The LDPE bags with the ethylene scavenger performed satisfactorily and can considerably delay the ripening, which may result in longer shelf life and conservation of fresh purple passion fruits. Practical Application. This work presents a novel packaging proposal that reduces oxygen and ethylene levels in contact with purple passion fruits. Our proposed active packaging can be used to increase the fruit shelf life by improving its conservation conditions throughout the chain of storage, transport, and distribution in the market. With this, it will be possible to reduce the fruit's losses due to senescence and to reduce the substrate consumption by using a more effective packaging system. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Food by-products valorisation: grape pomace and olive pomace (pate) as sources of phenolic compounds and fiber for enrichment of tagliatelle pasta.		Food Chemistry					Wine and olive oil making by-products are rich sources of bioactive compounds suitable for new healthy recipes of staple foods. In this study, the profile of pasta (tagliatelle) fortified with 7% of grape pomace (GP) or olive pomace (pate, OP) was studied, focusing on phenolic compounds after cooking. The enriched tagliatelle retained the same monoglycosylated and acetylated anthocyanins found in grape pomace. The fortified tagliatelle with a new milling by-product called pate retained hydroxytyrosol after cooking (6.6 mg/100 g). In both the two types of enriched tagliatelle the fiber content increased of approx. 3%, while the added phenols retained after cooking by tagliatelle fortified with GP and OP were 6.21 mg/100 g and 9 mg/100 g, respectively. The fortified tagliatelle retained a good cooking resistance and a good texture after cooking, thus enhancing the nutritional profile of pasta, a staple food usually characterized by a negligible amount of phenolic compounds and fiber.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, thermal processes were developed for cocoa powder against Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes in a pilot Radiofrequency (RF) unit and validated using their respective surrogates Enterococcus faecium NRRL B-2354 and Listeria innocua. For 1.0 kg cocoa powder samples, RF heating to 90 °C provided 1.74-1.84 log reduction of E. faecium. A 48 min holding post-RF heating provided an additional 3.65 and 2.24 log10 CFU/g reduction of E. faecium for insulated and non-insulated samples, respectively. Compared to E. faecium, L. innocua was less resistant to RF heating in aw 0.45 cocoa powder; RF heating to 75 °C coupled with 24 min insulated holding resulted in an additional 5.64 log10 CFU/g reduction. These data suggested that E. faecium was a conservative surrogate strain for controlling Salmonella and L. monocytogenes during RF processing of cocoa powder. To achieve maximal microbial reduction and improve energy efficiency, an insulated holding following RF heating is highly recommended. According to the predictive line obtained from the Bigelow model, a 7.6 min RF heating plus 48 min insulated holding attained a 5-log reduction of E. faecium without a negative impact on the color of cocoa powder.

J		Balmaseda, A.; Rozes, N.; Bordons, A.; Reguant, C.							Simulated lees of different yeast species modify the performance of malolactic fermentation by Oenococcus oeni in wine-like medium.		Food Microbiology					The use of non-Saccharomyces yeast together with S. cerevisiae in winemaking is a current trend. Apart from the organoleptic modulation of the wine, the composition of the resulting yeast lees is different and may thus impact malolactic fermentation (MLF). Yeasts of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Torulaspora delbrueckii and Metschnikowia pulcherrima were inactivated and added to a synthetic wine. Three different strains of Oenococcus oeni were inoculated and MLF was monitored. Non-Saccharomyces lees, especially from some strains of T. delbrueckii, showed higher compatibility with some O. oeni strains, with a shorter MLF and a maintained bacterial cell viability. The supplementation of lees increased nitrogen compounds available by O. oeni. A lower mannoprotein consumption was related with longer MLF. Amino acid assimilation by O. oeni was strain specific. There may be many other compounds regulating these yeast lees-O. oeni interactions apart from the well-known mannoproteins and amino acids. This is the first study of MLF with different O. oeni strains in the presence of S. cerevisiae and non-Saccharomyces yeast lees to report a strain-specific interaction between them.

J		Balmaseda, A.; Aniballi, L.; Rozes, N.; Bordons, A.; Reguant, C.							Use of yeast mannoproteins by Oenococcus oeni during malolactic fermentation under different oenological conditions.		Foods					Oenococcus oeni is the main agent of malolactic fermentation in wine. This fermentation takes place after alcoholic fermentation, in a low nutrient medium where ethanol and other inhibitor compounds are present. In addition, some yeast-derived compounds such as mannoproteins can be stimulatory for O. oeni. The mannoprotein concentration in wine depends on the fermenting yeasts, and non-Saccharomyces in particular can increase it. As a result of the hydrolytic activity of O. oeni, these macromolecules can be degraded, and the released mannose can be taken up and used as an energy source by the bacterium. Here we look at mannoprotein consumption and the expression of four O. oeni genes related to mannose uptake (manA, manB, ptsI, and ptsH) in a wine-like medium supplemented with mannoproteins and in natural wines fermented with different yeasts. We observe a general gene upregulation in response to wine-like conditions and different consumption patterns in the studied media. O. oeni was able to consume mannoproteins in all the wines. This consumption was notably higher in natural wines, especially in T. delbrueckii and S. cerevisiae 3D wines, which presented the highest mannoprotein levels. Regardless of the general upregulation, it seems that mannoprotein degradation is more closely related to the fermenting medium. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					Non-Saccharomyces yeasts have increasingly been used in vinification recently. This is particularly true of Torulaspora delbrueckii and Metschnikowia pulcherrima, which are inoculated before S. cerevisiae, to complete a sequential alcoholic fermentation. This paper aims to study the effects of these two non-Saccharomyces yeasts on malolactic fermentation (MLF) carried out by two strains of Oenococcus oeni, under cellar conditions. Oenological parameters, and volatile and phenolic compounds were analysed in wines. The wines were tasted, and the microorganisms identified. In general, non-Saccharomyces created more MLF friendly conditions, largely because of lower concentrations of SO2 and medium chain fatty acids. The most favourable results were observed in wines inoculated with T. delbrueckii, that seemed to promote the development of O. oeni and improve MLF performance. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Using Torulaspora delbrueckii as starter culture for alcoholic fermentation (AF) is a current trend for enhancing the quality of red wines. As red winemaking usually requires subsequent malolactic fermentation (MLF), the compatibility of this yeast and Oenococcus oeni is a key factor for a successful fermentative process. In this work we study the interactions of T. delbrueckii and O. oeni in wines from grapes with different degrees of maturity. The results showed higher total polyphenolic index (TPI) values in T. delbrueckii wines. Moreover, the aromatic characteristics were improved in these wines, compared to the wines inoculated only with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. There was also a reduction in some inhibitor compounds for O. oeni, for instance medium chain fatty acids, as a result of the fermentation with this non-Saccharomyces. Overall, the use of T. delbrueckii resulted in better MLF performances. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The effect of natural antimicrobials on the Campylobacter coli T6SS+/- during in vitro infection assays and on their ability to adhere to chicken skin and carcasses.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Reducing the Campylobacter load on poultry carcasses represents a major tasks for the industry as its ability to reduce their presence is of major interest aiming to increase consumer safety. This study investigated the ability of a mixture of natural antimicrobials (A3001) to reduce the adherence of the T6SS+/-C. coli isolates (NC1hcp-, NC2hcp- and NC3hcp+) to chicken neck skin and whole carcasses. Overall, the antimicrobial mixture induced a significant reduction in the capability of our C. coli isolates to colonise the chicken skin (p< 0.05) and carcasses (p< 0.0001) but with a greater effect (3 log reduction) on the NC3 isolate. Using the HCT-8 in vitro infection model we also show that at a concentration of 0.5% A3001, the impact on the NC3 isolate is accompanied by the downregulation of the hcp gene (p=0.0001), and indicator of the T6SS presence. The results described herein also indicated that these isolates are highly resistant to H2O2, up to 20 mM, suggesting a high resilience to environmental stresses. In summary our study shows that natural antimicrobials can reduce the ability of T6SS positive chicken C. coli isolates to adhere to chicken skin or to the whole carcass and to infect epithelial cells in vitro and could be considered a potential intervention at processor level.

Investigation of the effect of oyster mushroom (Pleurotus ostreatus) powder on biscuit production and effect on quality criteria by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of oyster mushroom powder addition (10, 20, and 30% levels by the replacement method with wheat flour) on the chemical and physical characteristics of biscuits. With the addition of oyster mushroom powder, an increase was observed in volume, spread ratio, and protein content of control biscuit group 5.36%, 6.87%, 40.96%, respectively. As a result of addition of mushroom powder, 26.97% decrease was observed on hardness values of the biscuit, while 5.94% increase in fracturability value was observed. According to sensorial analysis results, the 10% oyster mushroom powder in biscuit products showed the best sensory properties in terms of general acceptability and average values. FTIR was used to identify changes in functional groups such as lipids, carbohydrates, and proteins and indicated that addition of oyster mushroom powder caused increase in the protein bands and secondary structural components. Practical applications. In this study, besides the production of protein-enriched biscuits, the quality criteria of the biscuits produced using FTIR were also evaluated. This study was performed to evaluate the effect of partial replacement of oyster mushroom powder on the chemical and physical characteristics of biscuits. Biscuits containing 62% more protein than the control group was obtained. In future studies, it is aimed to produce foods enriched with natural additives and to examine the quality criteria using Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	2			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15174					FSTA:2021-06-Mq3581

Determination of conformational changes of polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase in peach juice during mild heat treatment using FTIR spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The effect of thermal treatment on activity and structural changes of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) in peach juice was investigated. The D70 values for PPO and POD were 10.38 and 13.68 min, respectively. The z values for PPO and POD were found to be 3.35 and 23.15 °C, respectively. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was used to determine the conformational changes. With the increase in temperature, alpha-helix and beta-sheet were decreased, and beta-turn and aggregated beta-sheet structure were increased for PPO, random coil and beta-sheet decreased, while aggregated beta-sheet structure increased for POD. In contrast, an increase in alpha-helix structure of POD was observed which was thought to be effective in POD regeneration. Furthermore, native and denatured forms of enzymes were discriminated by using principle component analysis (PCA), and models that correlated activity and secondary structural components with infrared spectra were constructed by using partial least square (PLS). © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Metabolic profiling of probiotic low-sodium Prato cheese with flavour enhancers: usefulness of NMR spectroscopy and chemometric tools.		International Dairy Journal					The metabolic profiling of probiotic low-sodium Prato cheeses with addition of food enhancers (arginine, yeast extract, and oregano extract) along the ripening time (1, 30, 60 days) using NMR spectroscopy and chemometric tools (PCA and PLS-DA) was evaluated. Aromatic and aliphatic structures and lactic acid were the most dominant compounds regardless of the flavour enhancer added. The addition of flavour enhancers decreased the lactic acid content and increased the content of leucine, isoleucine, and valine, fatty acids, tyrosine, phenylalanine, histidine, benzoic acid, and formic acid. Principal components analysis differentiated cheese samples based on the contents of lactic, acetic, formic, benzoic, and fatty acids, valine, leucine, isoleucine, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and histidine. Partial least square discriminant analysis classified the cheese types based on composition and highlighted the compounds variability according to the ripening time.

Effect of probiotic Minas Frescal cheese on the volatile compound and metabolic profiles assessed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and chemometric tools.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 as a probiotic culture on the production of volatile organic compounds and metabolic profile of Minas Frescal cheese. Lactose (alpha-lactose and beta-lactose), fatty acids (unsaturated and saturated), citric acid, tryptophan, and benzoic acid were the main compounds. Compared with the control cheese, probiotic cheese was characterized by the highest concentration of tryptophan and presented a higher number of volatile acids. The control cheese was characterized by the highest concentration of benzoic acid and fatty acids, resulting in a higher number of volatile alcohols and esters. No differences were observed for alpha-lactose, beta-lactose, and citric acid contents. A clear separation of probiotic and control Minas Frescal cheese was obtained using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, demonstrating that the addition of probiotic culture altered the metabolic profile of Minas Frescal cheese. Overall, the findings suggested that the addition of probiotic culture promoted the proteolysis in the fresh cheeses, decreased the lipolysis, and altered the volatile compounds. Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy coupled to chemometrics tools could be used to differentiate probiotic and conventional cheeses. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Synbiotic sheep milk ice cream reduces chemically induced mouse colon carcinogenesis.		Journal of Dairy Science					Sheep dairy products containing prebiotic and probiotic ingredients may have health-promoting properties. Thus, this study evaluated the effects of sheep milk ice cream [conventional full-fat (CONV), full-fat enriched with probiotic (PROB, 100 mg% wt/wt of Lacticaseibacillus casei 01), or nonfat synbiotic (SYNB, Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 and inulin, 10% wt/wt)] on carcinogen-induced colonic crypt cytotoxicity and premalignant lesion development. Male Swiss mice received 2 doses of colon carcinogen azoxymethane (AOM, 15 mg/kg of body weight) at wk 3 and 4. Two weeks before and during AOM administrations (4 wk) mice were treated with CONV, PROB, or SYNB by gavage (10 mL/kg). Mice were euthanized at wk 4 or 25 (n=5 or 10 mice/group, respectively). At wk 4, a significant reduction in micronucleated colonocytes was observed in PROB and SYNB groups, and a significant decrease in both p53 expression and apoptosis indexes in colonic crypts was observed in SYNB group. At wk 25, both PROB and SYNB interventions reduced the mean number of colonic premalignant lesions. However, only SYNB group showed lower incidence and number of high-grade premalignant lesions in the colonic mucosa. These findings indicate that PROB or SYNB sheep milk ice cream, especially SYNB intervention, can reduce chemically induced mouse colon carcinogenesis. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Balwinder Singh; Pal Singh, J.; Amritpal Kaur; Madhav P. Yadav							Insights into the chemical composition and bioactivities of citrus peel essential oils.		Food Research International					Citrus peel (CP), a by-product of the citrus fruit processing, comprises nearly forty to fifty percent of the fruit portion. Interestingly, the essential oil (EO) is primarily concentrated in the peel portion of the citrus fruit. Extraction of CP essential oil (CPEO) is an effective way of utilizing the citrus fruit processing waste. The CPEO can be more efficiently recovered from CP waste by improving the efficiency of conventional extraction processes. The main components of CPEO include monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their oxygenated derivatives. Specifically, limonene is the major oil component identified in the peel of different citrus species. The health promoting biological activities of CPEO are functioning as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antimicrobial and anticancer agents, thereby can be used as a source of functional components and preservatives for the development of nutritionally safe newer food products. This paper provides an in-depth knowledge about the chemical constituents and bioactivities of EOs extracted from peels of different citrus species.

J		Bambace, M. F.; Moreira, M. del R.; Sanchez-Moreno, C.; Ancos, B. de							Effects of combined application of high-pressure processing and active coatings on phenolic compounds and microbiological and physicochemical quality of apple cubes.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. In recent years the use of high-pressure processing (HPP) of fruit products has steadily increased due to its antimicrobial effectiveness and the retention of nutritional and quality attributes compared to conventional thermal technologies. Edible coatings are already being used to enhance the quality of minimally processed fruits. Thus, apple cubes (AC) and alginate-vanillin-coated apple cubes (AVAC) were subjected to HPP (400MPa/5 min/35 °C). The microbiological and physicochemical parameters were evaluated and the bioactive compounds were monitored before and after HPP of apple cubes. Also, an in vitro gastrointestinal digestion (GID) was conducted. Results. HPP left L. monocytogenes counts below the detection limit (2 log UFCg-1), regardless of the presence of coating. For E. coli, HPP+active coating showed a synergism affording the greatest reduction (>5 log) for AVAC-HPP. Firmness was maintained in AVAC-HPP samples, while AC-HPP samples suffered reductions of 35%. Colour attributes were also better retained in AVAC-HPP samples. In general, HPP led to a decrease in phenolic compounds. Regarding the effects of GID, vanillin-based active coating exerted a protective effect on some phenolics. Thus, p-coumaroylquinic acid concentration was maintained for AVAC and AVAC-HPP during GID. Epigallocatechin, the compound with the highest concentration in apple cubes, increased for AVAC (106%) and AVAC-HPP (57%). Also, phloridzin concentration increased for AVAC-HPP (17%).

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The prevalence of lactose intolerance, milk protein allergies, and the increasing vegan population have led to a growing demand for probiotic products based on non-conventional food matrices. In this study, the potential use of fresh blueberries as carriers of Lacticaseibacillus casei CECT 9104 and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis CECT 8145 incorporated into alginate-based prebiotic coatings was evaluated. Protective effect of inulin + oligofructose on probiotic viability, microbiological and sensory quality of fruits, and also, antagonistic effects of probiotics on co-inoculated E. coli O157:H7 and L. innocua were the main parameters studied along 14 days of refrigerated storage. A protective effect was observed since prebiotic enrichment allowed maintaining both L. casei and B. lactis viability above the minimum recommended levels (106 CFU/g) up to the end of storage, and therefore, ensuring their beneficial health action. Regarding safety issues, both probiotics exerted a biocontrol effect on inoculated L. innocua with reductions up to 2.31 log. Moreover, enrichment of blueberries with B. lactis through the application of prebiotic coatings maintained quality and sensory characteristics for 14 days at 5 °C. Thus, the development of functional blueberries coated with prebiotic-probiotic mixtures was achieved. These ready-to-eat fruits constitute novel, healthy and multifunctional alternatives of non-dairy probiotic foods that would allow meeting the current consumer demand. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Biopreservative efficacy of grape (Vitis vinifera) and clementine mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata) by-product extracts in raw ground beef patties.		Meat Science					Beef patties were treated with 450 mug/g of extracts from grape (Vitis vinifera) seeds (GSE), pomace (GPE) or orange (Citrus reticulata) pomace (OPE) and compared to negative (no extract; CTR) and positive (sodium metabisulphite; SMB) controls for their effect on colour, lipid and protein oxidation and bacterial growth under simulated retail display conditions (4 °C) for 9 d, and sensory quality. Antioxidant activity and redness of beef patties increased in the order of CTR < OPE = GPE < GSE < SMB. The order of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and carbonyl values were CTR > GPE = OPE > GSE > SBM, while that of bacterial counts were CTR > GSE = GPE > OPE > SMB. Retail display period had significant effect on all the shelf-life parameters. Overall, intensity of aroma, beef-like aroma and flavour in beef patties were highest in OPE. Results suggested that GSE and OPE could be commercially valorised as natural antioxidants and antibacterials in beef patties, respectively. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of Allura Red AC for small non-food-producing mammals and ornamental birds (Versele-Laga).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Allura Red AC for small non-food-producing mammals and ornamental birds when used as an additive that add or restore colour in feedingstuffs. The use of Allura Red AC up to the proposed conditions of use of 500mg/kg complete feed is considered safe for guinea pig, chinchilla, degu, hamster, gerbil and chipmunk. The following maximum safe levels (mg/kg complete feed) apply to the following species: ferrets 99, rabbits 123, canaries, budgerigars, mynah and toucans 45, lovebirds 51, cockatiels 79, cockatoos 115, amazons 145, parrots 147, yellow breast macaw 150, blue-throated macaw 173 and hyacinth macaw 214. The maximum safe level of Allura Red AC for other small non-food-producing mammal is 99mg/kg feed and for other ornamental birds is 45mg/kg feed. Inhalation exposure of Allura Red is regarded as hazardous. In the absence of data, the Panel cannot conclude on the potential of Allura Red to be a skin/eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the efficacy of the additive. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Capsozyme SB Plus as a zootechnical feed additive (digestibility enhancers) for chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying and minor poultry species (for fattening and reared for laying). The additive contains two enzyme ingredients (alpha-galactosidase, produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Aspergillus tubingensis; and endo-1,4-beta-xylanase, produced by a non-genetically modified strain of Trichoderma longibrachiatum) and is presented in solid form. In 2020, the FEEDAP Panel issued an opinion on this product. In that assessment, the Panel considered the additive safe for the target species and the environment. The Panel concluded that the additive does not raise concern for genotoxicity but could not conclude on consumer safety due to the limitations identified in the 90-day toxicity study. Owing to the lack of data, the Panel could not conclude on the potential of the additive as a skin or eye irritant nor as a skin sensitiser. Moreover, the Panel could not conclude on the efficacy of the additive for chickens for fattening due to the limited evidence provided. The applicant provided supplementary data to support the safety for consumers and the efficacy of the product in chickens for fattening. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the data provided support the absence of toxicological risk for the consumer. Likewise, according to the new data submitted, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious in chickens for fattening at the level of 14 GALU (alpha-galactosidase) /18 AXC (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase) per kg feed, and this conclusion was extended to chickens reared for laying and extrapolated to minor poultry species for fattening/reared for laying. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of monosodium L-glutamate monohydrate produced by fermentation using Corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM 80187 when used as a sensory additive (flavouring compound) in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The production strain is genetically modified and viable cells of the production strain, and its DNA were not detected in the final additive. The additive does not give rise to any safety concern regarding the production strain. Monosodium L-glutamate monohydrate produced using C. glutamicum KCCM 80187 is considered safe for the target species, for the consumer and for the environment. Moreover, it is considered not toxic by inhalation, not irritant to skin or eyes and not a dermal sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel expressed reservations on the use of the additive in water for drinking due to concerns on its impact on the hygienic conditions of the water.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of a tincture from the bark of Cinnamomum verum J. Presl (cinnamon tincture) for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a tincture from the bark of Cinnamomum verum J. Presl (cinnamon tincture) when used as a sensory additive in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The product is a water/ethanol solution, with a dry matter content of approximately 0.9%. The product contains on average 0.344% polyphenols (of which 0.001% are flavonoids) and 0.001% cinnamaldehyde. Methyleugenol was present at the limit of detection in one out of the five batches examined. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that cinnamon tincture is safe at the maximum proposed use level of 50mg/kg complete feed for all animal species except horses. For horses, the maximum proposed use level of 60mg/kg complete feed is considered safe. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of cinnamon tincture up to the highest proposed use levels in feed. The additive under assessment should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes, and as a skin and respiratory sensitiser. The use of the cinnamon tincture as a flavour in animal feed is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since C. verum and cinnamon bark extracts are recognised to flavour food and their function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary for the tincture under application. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Osbeck for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of expressed sweet orange oil and its fractions obtained from the fruit peels of Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck, when used as sensory additives (flavourings) in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The presence of perillaldehyde was identified as a source of potential concern. However, in target species fed citrus by-products as part of daily feed, the use of the expressed orange oil and its fractions was not expected to increase the exposure to perillaldehyde to a relevant extent (< 10%). For dogs, cats, ornamental fish and ornamental birds not normally exposed to citrus by-products, no conclusion can be drawn. For the other species, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additives under assessment are safe at the maximum proposed use levels in complete feed. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additives up to the maximum proposed use level in feed. The additives under assessment should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes, and as skin and respiratory sensitisers. The use of the additives under the proposed conditions of use in animal feed was not expected to pose a risk for the environment.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of iron (II) chelate of amino acids hydrate for all animal species.		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of iron (II) chelate of amino acids hydrate for all animal species, brand name Availa Fe, for all animal species, based on a dossier submitted for the modification of the terms of the authorisation of the additive. The additive is currently authorised using amino acids derived from soya protein and with a minimum content of 9% iron. The applicant proposed (i) to include amino acids from other sources such as hydrolysed corn gluten, hydrolysed potato protein and hydrolysed poultry feather meal; (ii) to include a minimum specification for free amino acids of 18%; (iii) to introduce a tighter specification on the mineral content (iron), with an inclusion level of 9-10%. The additive, produced using different proposed sources of hydrolysed proteins, complies with the specifications set by Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/2330. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use of the different proposed sources of hydrolysed proteins (i.e.soy, feather meal, potato and corn gluten) do not modify the conclusions reached in the previous assessments on the safety for the target species, consumers, environment and efficacy of the additive above. Concerning the safety for the users, the additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitiser. The additive has a high dusting potential; however, in the absence of data on the concentration of iron in the dust, it is not possible to make the assessment of the exposure by inhalation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panelon Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Protural (sodium benzoate) when used as a zootechnical additive in feed for weaned piglets and other growing Suidae at 4,000 mg/kg feedingstuff. Protural consists of sodium benzoate without any carrier materials and is currently authorised for use in weaned piglets. This opinion concerns the renewal of the authorisation of Proturalfor weaned piglets and the evaluation of the new use in other growing Suidae. The applicant provided evidence that the additive currently in the market complies with the existing conditions of authorisation. The FEEDAP Panelconcluded that Proturalis safe under the current conditions of authorisation for the target species, consumers of products from animals fed the additive and the environment. Protural was not considered as irritant to skin and eyes but a skin sensitiser. Based on dusting potential data, the FEEDAP Panel considered that the powder formulation of the additive represented a risk by inhalation. There was no need for assessing the efficacy of Proturalin the context of the renewal of the authorisation for weaned piglets. The efficacy data previously evaluated allowed the FEEDAP Panel to conclude that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at the level of 4,000 mg/kg feedingstuff in other growing Suidae. A conclusion cannot be reached for the efficacy in pigs for fattening. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the preparation of Bacillus subtilis CNCM I-4606, B. subtilis CNCM I-5043, B. subtilis CNCM I-4607 and Lactococcus lactisCNCM I-4609 when used as a technological additive (hygiene condition enhancer) for all animal species. The product is intended for use in compound feeds and feed materials for all animal species at a minimum inclusion level of 1*109 CFU B. subtilis and 1*109CFU L. lactis per kg or litre. The two bacterial species are considered by EFSA to be eligible for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach. As the identity of the strains has been clearly established and they did not show acquired resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary importance, the use of these strains in animal nutrition is considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. The additive is not irritant to skin and eyes or a skin sensitiser. Given the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive should be considered a respiratory sensitiser.

The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive under assessment is safe for all animal species up to the maximum proposed use levels of 1,000 mg/kg complete feed and 250 mg/kg water for drinking. No concerns for consumers were identified following the use of lemon extract up to the highest safe level in feed. The additive should be considered a skin and eye irritant, and a potential corrosive. The use of the extract in animal feed under the proposed conditions was not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Lemon extract was recognised to flavour food. Since its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy was considered necessary. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Assessment of the feed additive consisting of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly Lactobacillus paracasei) DSM 16245 for all animal species for the renewal of its authorisation (Lactosan GmbH & Co KG).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei (formerly Lactobacillus paracasei) DSM 16245 as a technological additive for all animal species. The additive aims to improve the production of silage and is currently authorised at a proposed application rate of 1*108 colony forming units (CFU)/kg fresh material. The applicant has provided evidence that the additive currently on the market complies with the existing conditions of authorisation. There was no new evidence to lead the FEEDAP Panel to reconsider its previous conclusions. Thus, the Panel concluded that the additive remains safe for all animal species, consumers and the environment under the authorised conditions of use. Regarding user safety L. paracasei DSM 16245 is not irritant to skin and eyes but is considered a skin and respiratory sensitiser. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of 3-nitrooxypropanol (Bovaer 10) for ruminants for milk production and reproduction (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Bovaer 10 as a zootechnical additive for ruminants for milk production and reproduction. Systemic exposure or site of contact toxicity for the active substance 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), for which genotoxicity has not been fully clarified, in the target species, is unlikely based on ADME data available. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that Bovaer 10 was safe for dairy cows at the maximum recommended level. However, as a margin of safety could not be established, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additive for other animal species/categories. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the consumer was exposed to 3-nitrooxypropionic acid (NOPA), which is one of the 3-NOP metabolites. NOPA was not genotoxic based on the studies provided. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the use of Bovaer 10 in animal nutrition under the conditions of use proposed was of no concern for consumer safety and for the environment. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the active substance 3-NOP may be harmful if inhaled. It is irritant (but not corrosive) to skin, irritant to the eyes but it is not a skin sensitiser. As the genotoxicity of 3-NOP is not completely elucidated, the exposure through inhalation of the additive may represent an additional risk for the user. The Panel concluded that the additive has a potential to be efficacious in dairy cows to reduce enteric methane production under the proposed conditions of use. This conclusion was extrapolated to all other ruminants for milk production and reproduction. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus (formerly Lactobacillus rhamnosus) NCIMB 30121 as a technological additive for all animal species. The additive aims to improve the production of silage and is authorised without a minimum inclusion level. The applicant provided evidence that the additive currently on the market complies with the existing conditions of authorisation. There was no new evidence to lead the FEEDAP Panel to reconsider its previous conclusions. Thus, the Panel concluded that the additive remains safe for all animal species, consumers and the environment under the authorised conditions of use. Regarding user safety, the additive should be considered a skin and respiratory sensitiser. No conclusions could be drawn on the eye and skin irritancy potential of the additive. There was no need for assessing the efficacy of the additive in the context of the renewal of the authorisation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of Bacillus velezensis DSM 15544 (Calsporin) for piglets (suckling and weaned), pigs for fattening, sows in order to have benefit in piglets, ornamental fish, dogs and all avian species (Asahi Biocycle Co.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Bacillus velezensisDSM 15544 (Calsporin) when used as a feed additive for piglets (suckling and weaned), pigs for fattening, sows in order to have benefit in piglets, ornamental fish, dogs and all avian species. The additive is authorised for use in sows, suckling and weaned piglets, pigs for fattening, chickens for fattening, laying hens, ornamental fish and dogs. With this application the company requested a new authorisation for all avian species and the modification of the current authorisations as regards the strain taxonomy from Bacillus subtilisDSM 15544 to B. velezensis DSM 15544. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the active agent of Calsporin should be taxonomically designated as Bacillus velezensis DSM 15544. The Panel also concluded that Calsporin is presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. Calsporin is not a dermal/eye irritant or a skin sensitiser but should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. Calsporin when supplemented at 3*108 CFU/kg complete feed has the potential to be efficacious in all avian species for rearing, fattening, laying and breeding purposes. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of manganese chelate of amino acids hydrate for all animal species (Zinpro Animal Nutrition (Europe) Inc.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of manganese chelate of amino acids hydrate, brand name AvailaMn, for all animal species, based on a dossier submitted for the modification of the terms of the authorisation of the additive. The additive is currently authorised using amino acids derived from soya protein and with a minimum content of 8% manganese. The applicant proposed (i) to include amino acids from other sources such as hydrolysed corn gluten, hydrolysed potato protein and hydrolysed poultry feather meal; (ii) to introduce a minimum specification for free amino acids of 17%; and (iii) to introduce a tighter specification on the mineral content (manganese), with an inclusion level of 8-9%. The additive, produced using different proposed sources of hydrolysed proteins, complies with the specifications set by Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1490. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use of the different proposed sources of hydrolysed proteins (i.e. soy, feather meal, potato and corn gluten) do not modify the conclusions reached in the previous assessments on the safety for the target species, consumers, environment and efficacy of the additive above. Concerning the safety for the users, the additive should be considered as a skin and eye irritant and a skin sensitiser. The additive has a high dusting potential; however, in the absence of data on the concentration of zinc in the dust it is not possible to make the assessment of the exposure by inhalation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum) DSM 26571 when used as a technological additive intended to improve ensiling of forage. The additive is intended for use with all forages and for all animal species at a proposed application rate of 1*108 colony forming units (CFU)/kg fresh material. The bacterial species L. plantarum is considered by EFSA to be suitable for the qualified presumption of safety approach to safety assessment. As the identity of the strain has been clearly established and no acquired antimicrobial resistance determinants of concern were detected, the use of the strain as a silage additive is considered safe for livestock species, for consumers and for the environment. The additive is not irritant to skin or eyes and is not a skin sensitiser but should be considered a potential respiratory sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the addition of Lactiplantibacillus plantarumDSM 26571 at a minimum concentration of 1*108CFU/kg may improve the production of silage from easy, moderately difficult and difficult to ensile forage material. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety of a feed additive consisting of a dried aqueous ethanol extract from the leaves of Melissa officinalis L. for all animal species (Nor-Feed SAS).		EFSA Journal					The additive under assessment is a dried aqueous ethanol extract of Melissa officinalis L. Leaves, intended to be used as a sensory additive (flavouring compound) in feed for all animal species. The aqueous ethanol extract is specified to contain≥10% of hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives including ≥3% of rosmarinic acid. In a previous assessment, considering the contradictory data from the Ames tests and uncertainty about the qualitative and quantitative presence of flavonoids and other compounds in the extract from M. officinalis L. Leaves, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) could not conclude on the safety of the additive at the proposed use levels of up to 100 mg/kg complete feed for the target species, the consumer and the user. The new data submitted identified luteolin 3′-glucuronide as the only flavonoid present in the additive, improved the characterisation of the hydroxycinnamates present and demonstrated that the additive is not genotoxic. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive under assessment is safe up to the maximum proposed use level of 100 mg/kg complete feed for all animal species. The use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of the additive up to the highest safe level in animal nutrition. The exposure of users to dusts from the additive is not of concern. No data are provided on irritant properties for eyes or skin, thus no conclusion can be drawn on these aspects. Due to the nature of the additive, it may be assumed to be potentially both a skin and respiratory sensitiser. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of a flavonoid-rich dried extract of Citrus*aurantium L. fruit (bitter orange extract) for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a dried flavonoid-rich extract of Citrus*aurantium L. Fruit (bitter orange extract), when used as a sensory additive for all animal species. The use of the additive in feed was not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins of those target species that are already fed citrus by-products to a relevant extent (< 5%). For dog, cat and ornamental fish, not normally exposed to citrus by-products, no conclusion could be drawn. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive under assessment is safe up to the maximum proposed use level of 400 mg/kg for veal calf (milk replacer), sheep, goat, horse and salmon. For the other species, the calculated maximum safe concentration in complete feed is 102 mg/kg for chicken for fattening, 151 mg/kg for laying hen, 136 mg/kg for turkey for fattening, 182 mg/kg for piglet, 217 mg/kg for pig for fattening, 268 mg/kg for sow, 259 mg/kg for dairy cow and 161 mg/kg for rabbit. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed, except dog, cat and ornamental fish. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additive up to highest safe level in feed for the target animals. The extract under assessment should be considered as irritant to skin, eyes and the respiratory tract, and as a skin sensitiser. Since the additive contains 5-methoxypsoralen, it may cause phototoxicity. The use of the extract in animal feed under the proposed conditions was not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Bitter orange extract was recognised to flavour food. Since its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy was considered necessary. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) for use in cats (FEDIAF).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA) when used as a technological additive (antioxidant) in feed for cats. BHA is a waxy solid consisting for > 98.5% of the active substance, a mixture of 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and is currently authorised for use in all animal species except in cats. In support of the safety of the additive for the target species, the applicant has submitted a tolerance study which demonstrated that BHA is tolerated by cats at a concentration up to 150 mg/kg complete feed. The additive should be considered a skin, eye irritant and a potential skin sensitiser. Exposure of the user via inhalation was considered unlikely; therefore, a risk is not expected. BHA is authorised as an antioxidant for food use at comparable use levels; therefore, no studies were required to demonstrate the efficacy of BHA as an antioxidant in complete feed for cats. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety of a feed additive consisting of a tincture derived from Verbascum thapsus L. (great mullein tincture) for use in all animal species (MANGHEBATI SAS).		EFSA Journal					The tincture derived from Verbascum thapsus L. (great mullein tincture) is intended to be used as a sensory additive in feed for all animal species. The product is a water/ethanol solution, with a dry matter content of ~2.8% and contains on average 0.216% polyphenols including 0.093% flavonoids. According to a previous assessment, the additive was not characterised in full and about 82% of the dry matter fraction remained uncharacterised (representing 2.26% of the tincture). There was also uncertainty on the potential presence of iridoid glycosides in the tincture. Therefore, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) could not conclude on the safety of the additive at the proposed use levels of up to 50 g/kg complete feed for all animal species or for the consumer. The applicant has provided new data which show that the unidentified fraction consists of crude fibre, other carbohydrates, and protein. The tincture also contains aucubin (0.004%). Considering the genotoxic potential of aucubin and other related iridoids, no conclusions can be drawn for long-living animals (pets and other non-food producing animals, horses and animals for reproduction). For short-living animals (animals for fattening), the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the tincture is safe at the maximum proposed use level of 50 mg/kg complete feed and that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No safety concerns would arise for the consumer from the use of the tincture up to the highest safe level in animal nutrition. In the absence of data, no conclusions can be drawn on the potential of the tincture to be a dermal/eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the production strain C. glutamicumKCCM 80227 qualifies for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment and is not detected in the final product. L-Lysine sulfate produced using C. glutamicumKCCM 80227 does not pose any safety concern associated with the production strain. The additive under assessment is considered safe for the target species. When using L-lysine sulfate, the background sulfur/sulfate content in the compound feed should be taken into account. L-Lysine sulfate produced by C. glutamicumKCCM 80227 is safe for the consumers, users and for the environment. The additive L-lysine sulfate is considered as an efficacious source of the essential amino acid L-lysine for non-ruminant animal species. For the supplemental L-lysine to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, it would require protection against degradation in the rumen. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of expressed mandarin oil from the fruit peels of Citrus reticulata Blanco for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of expressed mandarin oil from the fruit peels of Citrus reticulata Blanco, when used as a sensory additive (flavouring) in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the essential oil under assessment is safe up to the maximum proposed use levels in complete feed of 15 mg/kg for poultry, 33 mg/kg for pigs, 30 mg/kg for ruminants, 40 mg/kg for horse, and 15 mg/kg for salmon and rabbit. The presence of perillaldehyde was identified as a source of potential concern. However, in target species fed citrus by-products as part of daily feed the use of the expressed mandarin oil in feed was not expected to increase the exposure to perillaldehyde to a relevant extent (< 4%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by-products, no conclusion can be drawn. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additive up to the maximum proposed use level in feed.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of the feed additive consisting of Bacillus velezensis CECT 5940 (Ecobiol ) for turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding, minor poultry species for fattening and reared for laying and ornamental birds (Evonik Operations GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the extension of use of the feed additive consisting of Bacillus velezensis CECT 5940 (tradename: Ecobiol) to turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding, minor poultry species for fattening and reared for laying and ornamental birds (except for reproduction). The product under assessment is based on viable spores of a strain originally identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. During the course of the current assessment, the active agent has been reclassified as B. velezensis CECT 5940. The bacterial species B. velezensis is considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach. The identity of the active agent was established and the compliance with the other qualifications confirmed. Therefore, B. velezensis CECT 5940 is presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. Since no concerns are expected from the other components of the additive, the additive Ecobiol is also considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. The additive is not irritant to skin/eye or a skin sensitiser, but should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The efficacy data previously evaluated allowed the Panel to conclude that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at the level of 1*109 CFU/kg feed in turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding, minor poultry species for fattening and reared for laying and ornamental birds (except for reproduction). © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of feed additives consisting of Vitamin B2 (98%) and Vitamin B2 (80%) as riboflavin produced by Bacillus subtilis KCCM 10445 for all animal species (Hubei Guangji Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of vitamin B2 98% and vitamin B2 80% in the form of riboflavin produced by fermentation with a genetically modified strain of Bacillus subtilis (KCCM 10445) as nutritional additives in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The production strain harbours antimicrobial resistance genes. With the data available the Panel is not in the position to confirm the correspondence between the strain deposited under accession number KCCM 10445 and the strain under the current assessment. The production strain and its recombinant DNA were not detected in the final products. Therefore, the additives do not pose any safety concern associated with the genetic modification of the production strain. The additives are safe for the target species, the consumer and the environment. Vitamin B2 80% is not hazardous by inhalation. In the absence of data, no conclusions on the possible risk by inhalation of vitamin B2 98% can be reached. Neither vitamin B2 98% nor vitamin B2 80% are irritant to skin or eyes. In the absence of data, no conclusions on the skin sensitisation potential of the additives can be reached. The additives under assessment are effective in covering the animals' requirements for vitamin B2 when administered via feed and/or water for drinking. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of an essential oil from the fruits of Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. (litsea berry oil) for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of an essential oil from the fruits of Litsea cubeba (Lour.) Pers. (litsea berry oil), when used as a sensory additive (flavouring) in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that litsea berry oil is safe up to the maximum proposed use level of 125 mg/kg complete feed for ornamental fish. For the other species, the calculated safe concentration in complete feed are 11 mg/kg for chicken for fattening, 16 mg/kg for laying hen, 14 mg/kg for turkey for fattening, 19 mg/kg for piglet, 23 mg/kg for pig for fattening, 28 mg/kg for lactating sow, 48 mg/kg for veal calf (milk replacer), 43 mg/kg for cattle for fattening, sheep, goat and horse, 28 mg/kg for dairy cow, 17 mg/kg for rabbit, 47 mg/kg for salmon, 50 mg/kg for dog and 8.5 mg/kg for cat. The FEEDAP Panel also concluded that the use of litsea berry oil at the maximum proposed use level in water for drinking of 1 mg/kg is safe for all animal species. Simultaneous use in feed and water for drinking may lead to the maximum safe dose being exceeded. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additive up to the highest safe use level in feed for the target animals. The essential oil under assessment should be considered as irritant to skin and eyes, and as a skin and respiratory sensitiser.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of ferric (III) ammonium hexacyanoferrate (II) as technological feed additive for ruminants (domestic and wild), calves prior the start of rumination, lambs prior the start of rumination, kids prior the start of rumination and pigs (domestic and wild). The additive is already authorised for use in ruminants (domestic and wild), calves prior the start of rumination, lambs prior the start of rumination, kids prior the start of rumination and pigs (domestic and wild). The additive is effective at the minimum recommended concentration of 50 mg/kg complete feedingstuffs (corresponding to about 10 mg/10 kg bw) in reducing the contamination of food derived from ruminants (domestic and wild), calves, lambs and kids prior to the start of rumination, and pigs (domestic and wild) by caesium. Considering the scarce information available, the Panel is not in the position to conclude on the safety of the additive for the target species. The use of ferric (III) ammonium hexacyanoferrate (II) in feed for ruminants, calves, lambs, kids and pigs at the maximum recommended concentration of 500 mg/kg feed (corresponding to about 150 mg ferric (III) ammonium hexacyanoferrate (II)/10 kg bw) is safe for the consumer.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of titanium dioxide for all animal species (Titanium Dioxide Manufacturers Association).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of titanium dioxide (TiO2) for all animal species. TiO2 is applied to be used as a sensory additive (functional group: colourants; i) substances that add or restore colour in feedingstuffs). The specification for TiO2 used as feed additive meets the specifications of TiO2 used as food additive. The EFSA Panel on Food Additive and Flavourings (FAF) concluded that TiO2 (E171) can no longer be considered as safe when used as a food additive. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) endorses this conclusion and considers that it also applies to TiO2 as a feed additive for all animal species. TiO2 is absorbed to a low extent; however, particles of TiO2 can accumulate in the body due to their long half-life. The genotoxicity of TiO2 particles cannot be ruled out raising potential concerns on the safety of the additive for the target species (especially for long-living animals and reproductive animals), consumers and user. Considering this fact and the absence of specific data related to its use as a feed additive, the Panel cannot conclude on the safety of TiO2 for the target species, consumers and environment. In the absence of studies with the additive under assessment, the Panel cannot conclude on the assessment of the effects of the additive on eyes and skin. TiO2 is potentially carcinogenic to workers if inhaled. The concern for genotoxicity of TiO2 particles cannot be ruled out, this should be considered as an additional potential concern to users handling the additive.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of an essential oil from the leaves of Citrus x aurantium L. (petitgrain bigarade oil), when used as a sensory additive (flavouring) in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the essential oil under assessment is safe up to the maximum proposed use level of 125 mg/kg complete feed for ornamental fish. For the other species, the calculated safe concentrations in complete feed are 10 mg/kg for chicken for fattening, 14 mg/kg for laying hen, 13 mg/kg for turkey for fattening, 17 mg/kg for piglet, 20 mg/kg for pig for fattening, 25 mg/kg for lactating sow, 43 mg/kg for veal calf (milk replacer), 38 mg/kg for cattle for fattening, sheep, goat and horse, 24 mg/kg for dairy cow, 15 mg/kg for rabbit, 42 mg/kg for salmon, 44 mg/kg for dog and 8 mg/kg for cat. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use level in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. Simultaneous use in feed and water for drinking may lead to the maximum safe dose being exceeded. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additive up to the highest safe level in feed. The essential oil under assessment should be considered as irritant to skin, eyes and the respiratory tract, and as a skin sensitiser.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of acetic acid for all animal species.		EFSA Journal					In 2012, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) issued an opinion on the safety and efficacy of acetic acid when used as a technological additive (preservative) for all animal species. The characterisation and condition of use of the additive are the same as those already assessed by the FEEDAP Panel in the previous opinion on acetic acid. Acetic acid produced with the new manufacturing process complies with the specifications set by Commission Regulation (EU) No 231/2012. The FEEDAP Panel considers that the conclusions reached in the previous assessment apply to the acetic acid produced by the new manufacturing process. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is considered safe for poultry, pigs and pet animals at a maximum concentration of 2.5 g acetic acid/kg complete feed (or 1 g/L water for drinking). The known high endogenous production of acetic acid in the ruminants shows that the tolerance of these target animals is considerably higher. No data is available for salmonids. The use of the additive in animal nutrition is of no concern for consumer safety. The risks for users handling the additive depend on the concentration and include skin, eyes, and respiratory tract irritation (10-25% solution) and corrosion (> 25% solution). The use of the additive as a feed additive is considered safe for the environment. The Panel concluded that the additive has a potential to be efficacious as preservative in feedingstuffs and water for drinking.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on phyllite, a natural mixture of minerals of metamorphic origin, as a feed additive for all animal species. The additive, specified to contain at least 40% of mica, muscovite, illite, chlorite and talc as the main components, and maximum 60% of quartz, potassium-feldspar, sodium-feldspar and calcite, is intended for use as a technological additive (functional groups: (i) anticaking agents) in premixtures and feedingstuffs for all animal species at a maximum inclusion level of 25,000 mg/kg. The additive is safe for chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying/breeding at the maximum inclusion level of 25,000 mg/kg feed, with no margin of safety determined. Owing the absence of data in pigs and ruminants and in the absence of data on the potential genotoxicity of the additive, the Panel is not in the position to conclude on the safety of the additive for any other animal species/categories. The additive is considered safe for the consumers and the environment at the proposed conditions of use. In the absence of data, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the potential of the additive to be a skin and eye irritant and skin sensitiser. Exposure via inhalation is considered a risk.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of an additive consisting of potassium diformate (Formi LHS) for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening (Addcon GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of potassium diformate (Formi LHS) as a technological feed additive for piglets (weaned) and pigs for fattening. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that potassium diformate is safe for weaned piglets and for pigs for fattening at the level of 6,000 mg/kg complete feed, with no margin of safety. The use of potassium diformate in weaned piglets and pigs for fattening nutrition under the conditions of use proposed is of no concern for consumer safety. Potassium diformate does not raise concern regarding the effects on respiratory system and the skin but is an eye irritant. The use of potassium diformate as a feed additive is considered safe for the environment. The additive is considered to be efficacious as acidity regulator in feedingstuffs for weaned piglets and pigs for fattening at the minimum proposed concentration of 6,000 mg/kg complete feed. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Efficacy of the feed additive containing Companilactobacillus farciminis (formerly Lactobacillus farciminis) CNCM I-3740 (Biacton) for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and laying hens (ChemVet dk A/S).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the efficacy of the additive consisting of Companilactobacillus farciminis (formerly Lactobacillus farciminis) CNCM I-3740 (tradename: Biacton) for chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and laying hens. The additive is a preparation containing viable cells of C. farciminisCNCM I-3740 at the minimum concentration of 1*109 CFU/g additive. In a previous opinion, the FEEDAP Panel assessed the safety and the efficacy of the product when used in these target species. The Panel concluded that based on the qualified presumption of safety of the active agent, and the lack of concerns deriving from other components of the additive, Biacton was presumed safe for the target animals, consumers and the environment. Regarding the safety for the user, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the potential of the additive to be irritant to skin and eyes or its dermal sensitisation due to the lack of data. However, it concluded that the additive should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The data provided in the previous assessment to support the efficacy of the additive did not allow drawing conclusions on the efficacy of the additive in any of the target species. The additional information submitted with chickens for fattening and laying hens did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of Biacton for these target species. No new information was provided that would lead the Panel to reconsider the conclusions already reached on the use of the additive with turkeys for fattening. The FEEDAP Panel, based on the available data, cannot conclude on the efficacy of Biacton in chickens for fattening, turkeys for fattening and laying hens. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of Lactiplantibacillus plantarum (formerly Lactobacillus plantarum) DSM 21762, as a technological additive for all animal species. The applicant has provided evidence that the additive currently in the market complies with the existing conditions of authorisation. There was no new evidence that would lead the FEEDAP Panel to reconsider its previous conclusions. Thus, the Panel concluded that the additive remains safe for all animal species, consumer and the environment under the authorised conditions of use. The additive was not irritant to skin and eyes but is considered a skin and respiratory sensitiser. The present application for renewal of the authorisation did not include a proposal for amending or supplementing the conditions of the original authorisation that would have an impact on the efficacy of the additive.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of L-histidine monohydrochloride monohydrate produced using Escherichia coli NITE SD 00268 for all animal species (Kyowa Hakko Europe GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on L-histidine monohydrochloride (HCl) monohydrate produced by fermentation with Escherichia coli (NITE SD 00268) when used as a nutritional additive or as a feed flavouring compound in feed for all animal species. The active substance of the additive is L-histidine. The production strain has been modified by conventional mutagenesis and it does not raise safety concerns. The additive under assessment is safe for the target species when used as a nutritional additive to supplement the diet in appropriate amounts to cover the requirements, depending on the species, the physiological state of the animal, the performance level, the environmental conditions, the background amino acid composition of the unsupplemented diet and the status of some essential trace elements. This conclusion would cover its use as flavouring compound. L-Histidine HCl monohydrate produced by E. coliNITE SD 00268, when used at the proposed conditions of use, is safe for the consumer and for the environment. L-Histidine HCl monohydrate produced using E. coliNITE SD 00268 is not a skin irritant. In the absence of data, it is not possible to conclude on the potential of the additive to be toxic by inhalation, irritant to eyes or a skin sensitiser. The additive L-histidine HCl monohydrate is regarded as an effective source of the amino acid L-histidine when used as a nutritional additive. For the supplemental L-histidine to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, it would require protection against degradation in the rumen. L-Histidine is efficacious as a flavouring compound. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority. EFSA Journal published by John Wiley and Sons Ltd on behalf of European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Assessment of the feed additive consisting of dimethylglycine sodium salt (Taminizer D) for chickens for fattening for the renewal of its authorisation (Taminco N.V.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of the feed additive consisting of dimethylglycine sodium salt (trade name: Taminizer D) as a zootechnical additive for chickens for fattening. In 2011, the FEEDAP Panel delivered an opinion on the safety and efficacy of the additive, and subsequently, the additive was authorised in the EU. In 2018, a second scientific assessment was made based on a dossier submitted for the modification of the terms of authorisation of the additive. The additive is authorised as "dimethylglycine sodium salt with a purity of at least 97%" for chickens for fattening under the category "zootechnical additives" and functional group "other zootechnical additives (improvement of zootechnical parameters)". The evidence provided by the applicant indicated that the additive currently in the market, produced by the two manufacturing routes, complies with the conditions of authorisation. No new evidence was found that would make the FEEDAP Panel reconsidering its previous conclusions in the safety for target species, consumers and environment. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that Taminizer D is not a skin irritant but may be an eye irritant and a skin sensitiser; although uncertainty remains on the presence of formaldehyde, exposure is considered extremely low. There is no need to assess the efficacy of the additive in the context of the renewal of the authorisation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

(G. biloba dry extract) when used as a sensory additive in feed for cats and dogs. G. biloba dry extract is specified to contain at least 24% flavonol glycosides, at least 6% terpene lactones and less than 5 ppm ginkgolic acids. Since uncertainty remains concerning the nature of up to 75% of the extract, the additive is not sufficiently characterised to allow an assessment based on the individual components. In view of the indication of potential carcinogenicity from the results of studies by the National Toxicology Program of the USA, obtained with a G. biloba extract comparable with the additive under assessment, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive cannot be considered safe for cats and dogs. In the absence of data, no conclusions can be drawn on the safety for the user. In the absence of evidence that the extract acts as a flavour in animal feed or has an effect on palatability, the FEEDAP Panel was unable to conclude on the efficacy of the additive. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of a preparation of benzoic acid, calcium formate and fumaric acid (AviMatrix Z) for all avian species other than laying birds (Novus Europe S.A. / N.V).		EFSA Journal					The additive AviMatrix Z is a preparation of benzoic acid, calcium formate and fumaric acid and is authorised as a feed additive in chickens for fattening and reared for laying. The applicant has requested to extend the use of the additive to all avian species other than laying birds at a concentration range from 500 to 1,000 mg/kg of complete feed. The safety of the additive was previously assessed by the FEEDAP Panel that concluded that there were no concerns for the consumers and no risks for the environment. Given the particle size distribution and low dusting potential of the additive, the exposure of workers by inhalation and the subsequent health risks were expected to be low. AviMatrix Z is not considered to be a skin/eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel is not aware of any new information that would lead to reconsider the conclusions drawn previously. The results of a new tolerance study showed that the additive is tolerated by turkeys for fattening at threefold the highest recommended dose (1,000 mg/kg feed). Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for turkeys for fattening at the maximum recommended dose and this conclusion was extended to turkeys reared for breeding. Due to the absence of a margin of safety in a trial in chickens for fattening previously evaluated, the FEEDAP Panel could not extrapolate this conclusion to all other avian species up to the point of lay. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious in all avian species other than laying and breeding birds. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Danisco Xylanase 40000 G/L is the trade name of the feed additive under assessment and contains endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by a genetically modified strain of Trichoderma reesei. It is authorised for use in chickens for fattening, laying hens, ducks, turkeys for fattening, all minor poultry species, weaned piglets and pigs for fattening. This scientific opinion concerns the request for the renewal of the authorisation of the additive for the species/categories for which there is an authorisation, a reduction of the minimum recommended level in turkeys for fattening and the extension of use to all poultry species (other than ducks) for fattening or reared for laying/breeding and for laying, suckling piglets and minor growing porcine species. The applicant provided evidence that the additive currently in the market complies with the conditions of the authorisation. There is no new evidence that would lead the EFSA Panel on Additives and products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) to reconsider previous conclusions that the additive remains safe for the animal species/categories, the consumer and the environment under the authorised conditions of use. This conclusion applies also to the new target species/categories for which a request of use is made. The additive is not irritant to skin but should be considered as a possible eye irritant and, in common with other proteinaceous substances, respiratory sensitiser. There was no need for assessing the efficacy of the additive in the context of the renewal of the authorisation for chickens for fattening, laying hens, ducks, all minor poultry species, weaned piglets and pigs for fattening. The additive has the potential to be efficacious at 625 U/kg complete feed in all poultry species for fattening (including turkeys) or reared for laying/breeding, and for laying and 2,000 U/kg complete feed in suckling piglets and all minor growing porcine species. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) as a feed additive for all animal species. The applicant provided data demonstrating that the additive currently in the market complies with the conditions of authorisation. The FEEDAP Panel confirms that the use of all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate under the current authorised conditions of use is safe for the target species, the consumers and the environment. No concern for user safety is expected from the use of the active substance, however, due to the lack of information, the FEEDAP Panel is not able to conclude on its skin sensitisation potential. To draw conclusions on the safety for the user of the final formulated additives, specific studies would be required.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of ferrous lysinate sulfate for all animal species (Phytobiotics Futterzusatzstoffe GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of ferrous lysinate sulfate as nutritional feed additive for all animal species. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) Panel was assigned to this mandate. Based on the results of a tolerance study, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that ferrous lysinate sulfate is safe in chickens for fattening when used up to the current maximum authorised levels of total iron in feed; this conclusion was extrapolated to all animal species and categories, at the respective maximum authorised iron levels in complete feed. The use of ferrous lysinate sulfate in animal nutrition up to the maximum iron content in complete feed authorised in the EU poses no concern to the safety of consumers. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that ferrous lysinate sulfate poses a risk to users by inhalation; the additive is not a dermal irritant, but is irritant to eyes and a skin sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use of ferrous lysinate sulfate in animal nutrition would not pose a risk for the environment. Owing to the limitations in the study provided, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the efficacy of the additive for chickens for fattening, and thus, on the efficacy of ferrous lysinate sulfate for all animal species and categories. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Assessment of a feed additive consisting of all-rac-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) for all animal species for the renewal of its authorisation (EUROPE-ASIA Import Export GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of all-rac-alpha tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) as a feed additive for all animal species. The applicant provided data demonstrating that the additive currently in the market complies with the conditions of authorisation. The FEEDAP Panel confirms that the use of all-rac-alpha-tocopheryl acetate under the current authorised conditions of use is safe for the target species, the consumers and the environment. No concern for user safety is expected from the use of the active substance; however, due to the lack of information, the FEEDAP Panel is not able to conclude on its skin sensitisation potential. To draw conclusions on the safety for the user of the final formulated additives, specific studies would be required.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of an additive consisting of synthetic vitamin K1 (phytomenadione) for horses (JARAZ Enterprises GmbH & Co. KG).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of vitamin K1 (phytomenadione) produced by chemical synthesis when used as a nutritional additive in complementary feed of horses at a maximum supplemental level of 14 mg vitamin K1/horse per day. The use of vitamin K1 is safe when used as a feed additive for horses under the proposed conditions of use. The use of vitamin K1 in nutrition of horses under the proposed conditions of use is considered safe for the consumer and the environment. No exposure of users by inhalation is expected. The Panel cannot conclude on the potential of the additive to be a skin and eye irritant. Vitamin K1 is considered a moderate dermal sensitiser. Vitamin K1 is an effective source of vitamin K in horse nutrition. The Panel recommends that the specifications of the additive refer to the substance-related impurities listed in the most updated monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of L-valine produced by Corynebacterium glutamicum CGMCC 7.366 for all animal species (Ningxia Eppen Biotech Co., Ltd.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of the feed additive consisting of L-valine produced by fermentation using a non-genetically modified strain of Corynebacterium glutamicum (CGMCC 7.366). The additive is intended to be used in feed and water for drinking for all animal species and categories. The production strain is considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that L-valine produced using C. glutamicum CGMCC 7.366 is safe for the target species when supplemented in appropriate amounts to the diet according to the nutritional needs of the target species. The FEEDAP Panel has concerns on the use of amino acids in water for drinking for hygienic reasons, and due to the risk of imbalances when administered simultaneously via feed. The use of L-valine produced using C. glutamicum CGMCC 7.366 in animal nutrition is considered safe for the consumer and for the environment. No conclusion could be drawn on the potential of L-valine produced using C. glutamicum CGMCC 7.366 to be toxic by inhalation, irritant to the skin or eyes, or a dermal sensitiser due to the lack of data. The additive L-valine produced by fermentation using C. glutamicum CGMCC 7.366 is regarded as an efficacious source of the essential amino acid L-valine for non-ruminant nutrition. For the supplemental L-valine to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, it requires protection against degradation in the rumen. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a dried extract prepared from the roots of Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer (P. ginseng dry extract) when used as a sensory additive in feed for cats and dogs. P. ginseng dry extract is specified to contain at least 27-30% total ginsenosides (as ginsenosides RG1). Since uncertainty remains concerning the nature of up to 73% of the extract, the FEEDAP Panel was unable to conclude on the safety of the additive at the proposed use levels of up to 20 mg/kg complete feed for cats and dogs. In the absence of data, no conclusions can be drawn on the safety for the user. Since ginseng and its extracts are recognised to flavour food and their function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of feed additives consisting of expressed lemon oil and its fractions from Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck and of lime oil from Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of expressed lemon oil and distilled lemon oil from Citrus limon (L.) Osbeck and lime oil from Citrus aurantiifolia (Christm.) Swingle, when used as sensory additives in feed for all animal species. The use of the expressed lemon oil and its residual fraction and the use of lime oil in feed is not expected to increase the exposure to furocoumarins and methoxycoumarins and perillaldehyde of those target species that are already fed citrus by-products a relevant extent (< 10%). For companion animals and ornamental fish not normally exposed to citrus by-products, no conclusion can be drawn. For the other species and for the distilled fraction of expressed lemon oil, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additives under assessment are safe at the maximum proposed or at reduced use levels in complete feed. The Panel considers that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. No concerns for consumer safety were identified following the use of the additives at the maximum proposed use level in feed. The additives under assessment should be considered as irritants to skin and eyes and the respiratory tract and as skin sensitisers. Since expressed lemon oil and its fractions contain furocoumarins, they may cause phototoxicity. The use of the additives under the proposed conditions of use in animal feed is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since C. Limon and C. aurantiifolia and their preparations are recognised to flavour food and its function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of copper chelate of ethylenediamine for all animal species (Zinpro Animal Nutrition (Europe), Inc.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of copper chelate of ethylenediamine (Copper-EDA-Cl) as a feed additive for all animal species. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP Panel) identified several issues related to the data provided concerning the chemical characteristics of the additive and, based on the information provided from an in vitro dissociation study, considered it unlikely that the additive consists only of copper mono-chelate of EDA but of several coexisting (copper) species. Therefore, in the absence of adequate experimental data and owing to the uncertainties identified, the Panel cannot conclude on its identity and characterisation of the additive. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening and reared for laying/breeding but cannot conclude on the safety for other animal species/categories. The FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer or the environment. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that handling the additive poses a risk to users by inhalation. The additive should be considered as non-irritant for the skin but corrosive for the eyes and a skin sensitiser. The Panel notes the uncertainties on the genotoxicity potential of the additive that might have an impact on the conclusions on the safety for the user. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is efficacious in providing copper to meet the nutritional requirements of this trace element in all animal species. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of ECONASEXT (endo-1,4-beta-xylanase) produced by a genetically modified strain of Trichoderma reesei (CBS 140027) as a zootechnical feed additive for piglets (weaned), pigs for fattening, chickens for fattening, chickens reared for laying, laying hens, turkeys for fattening, turkeys reared for breeding and minor poultry species. The recipient strain and the production strain T. reesei CBS 140027 are considered safe. The additive is safe for chickens for fattening and weaned piglets at the maximum recommended doses (16,000 and 24,000 BXU/kg feed, respectively) with a wide margin of safety (100-fold and 50-fold, respectively). These conclusions are extended to chickens reared for laying and to pigs for fattening at 16,000 and 24,000 BXU/kg feed, respectively. The additive is safe for turkeys for fattening or reared for breeding at 16,000 BXU/kg feed. The FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for laying hens and for minor poultry species for laying at the proposed conditions of use. The information provided does not allow to conclude on the safety of the use of ECONASE XT P/L produced by T. reesei CBS 140027 in animal nutrition for the consumers. The use of the additive under assessment in animal nutrition does not raise safety concerns for the environment. ECONASEXT L is non-irritant to the skin or to the eyes. In absence of data, the FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the potential of the solid product to be irritant to skin and eyes and on the potential of the additive in all forms to be a dermal sensitiser. All forms of the additive should be considered as respiratory sensitisers. All forms of the additive are considered efficacious at the minimum recommended levels for the target species. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of a tincture derived from roots of Gentiana lutea L. (gentian tincture) for use in all animal species (FEFANA asbl).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of a tincture from the roots of Gentiana lutea L. (gentian tincture) when used as a sensory feed additive for all animal species. The product is a solution, with a dry matter content of approximately 4.3%. The product contains on average 0.0836% polyphenols (of which 0.0463% are flavonoids and 0.0027% xanthones) and 0.0022% gentiopicroside. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that gentian tincture is safe at the maximum proposed use level of 50 mg/kg complete feed for short-living animals (animals for fattening). The FEEDAP Panel considers that the use in water for drinking is safe provided that the total daily intake of the additive does not exceed the daily amount that is considered safe when consumed via feed. Considering the genotoxic potential of gentiopicroside and xanthones (gentisin and isogentisin), no conclusions can be drawn for long-living animals (companion animals, horses and animals for reproduction). No safety concern would arise for the consumer from the use of gentian tincture up to the highest safe level in animal nutrition. In the absence of data, no conclusions can be drawn on the potential of the tincture to be a dermal/eye irritant or a skin sensitiser. The data available do not allow to conclude on risks of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity for dermal exposure. Use of the tincture derived from G. lutea as a flavour in animal feed is not expected to pose a risk for the environment. Since G. lutea and gentian root extract are recognised to flavour food and their function in feed would be essentially the same as that in food, no further demonstration of efficacy is considered necessary for the tincture under application. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the additive consisting of Bacillus subtilis DSM 32325 when used as technological additive (hygiene condition enhancer) in feed for all animal species. The product is intended for use in dry feeds at a minimum inclusion level of 1*108 colony forming unit (CFU) /kg complete feedingstuff. The bacterial species Bacillus subtilis DSM 32325 is considered by EFSA to be eligible for the qualified presumption of safety approach. As the identity of the strain has been clearly established and it did not show acquired resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary importance, the use of the strain in animal nutrition is considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. No conclusions can be drawn on the skin/eye irritancy or skin sensitisation potential of the product. Exposure of users by inhalation is likely and the product should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The Panel is not in the position to conclude on the efficacy of Bacillus subtilis DSM 32325 when used in animal nutrition as hygiene condition enhancer due to lack of data. Bacillus subtilis DSM 32325 is compatible with diclazuril, decoquinate and halofuginone. The data provided do not allow to conclude on the compatibility of the additive with monensin sodium, salinomycin sodium, narasin, robenidine hydrochloride and maduramicin ammonium. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety of the feed additives consisting of L-lysine monohydrochloride and L-lysine sulfate produced by Corynebacterium glutamicum CCTCC M 2015595 for all animal species (Kempex Holland B. V.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety of L-lysine monohydrochloride and L-lysine sulfate produced using Corynebacterium glutamicum CCTCC M 2015595 for all animal species. In 2019, the FEEDAP Panel issued an opinion on the safety and efficacy of the products. In that assessment, the Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additives for the target species, the consumers and the environment due to the uncertainties regarding the possible genetic modification of the strain used to obtain the production strain C. glutamicum CCTCC M 2015595 and on the possible presence of viable cells and DNA of the production strain in the final products. Moreover, in the absence of data, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additives for the users. The applicant provided supplementary data to characterise the strain from which the production strain under assessment was obtained. However, uncertainties remain on its origin and history of modification, including whether it has been genetically modified. The production strain C. glutamicum CCTCC M 2015595 did not show the presence of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes nor of toxin and virulence factors genes. Moreover, as viable cells and DNA of the production strain were not detected in both final formulations, L-lysine HCl and L-lysine sulfate do not raise safety concerns as regards the production strain. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that L-lysine HCl and L-lysine sulfate produced by C. glutamicum CCTCC M 2015595 are safe for the target species, consumers and for the environment. No additional data have been provided on the safety of the additives for users. Therefore, the conclusions from the Panel remained that in the absence of data, no conclusions on the safety of the additives for the user can be drawn. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of an additive consisting of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 for all animal species (Chr. Hansen A/S).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the additive consisting of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 when used as technological additive (hygiene condition enhancer) in feed for all animal species. The product is intended for use in dry feeds at a minimum inclusion level of 1*108 colony forming unit (CFU) /kg complete feedingstuffs. The bacterial species Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 is considered by EFSA to be eligible for the qualified presumption of safety approach. As the identity of the strain has been clearly established and it did not show acquired resistance to antibiotics of human and veterinary importance, the use of the strain in animal nutrition is considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. No conclusions can be drawn on the skin/eye irritancy or skin sensitisation potential of the product. Exposure of users by inhalation is likely and the product should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The Panel is not in the position to conclude on the efficacy of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 when used in animal nutrition as hygiene condition enhancer due to lack of data. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens DSM 25840 is compatible with diclazuril, decoquinate and halofuginone. The data provided do not allow to conclude on the compatibility of the additive with monensin sodium, salinomycin sodium, narasin, robenidine hydrochloride and maduramicin ammonium. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Assessment of a feed additive consisting of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) for all animal species for the renewal of its authorisation (Specialty Ingredients (Europe) B.V. and Vitae Caps S.A.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the assessment of the application for renewal of authorisation of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate (vitamin E) as a feed additive for all animal species. The applicant provided data demonstrating that the additive currently in the market complies with the conditions of authorisation. The FEEDAP Panel confirms that the use of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate under the current authorised conditions of use is safe for the target species, the consumers and the environment. No concern for user safety is expected from the use of the active substance; however, due to the lack of information, the FEEDAP Panel is not able to conclude on its skin sensitisation potential. To draw conclusions on the safety for the user of the final formulated additives, specific studies would be required. There is no need to assess the efficacy of RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate in the context of the renewal of the authorisation. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of the feed additives concentrated liquid L-lysine (base) and L-lysine monohydrochloride produced by Corynebacterium glutamicum KCCM 80183 for all animal species (CJ Europe GmbH).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on concentrated liquid L-lysine (base) and L-lysine monohydrochloride (HCl) produced using Corynebacterium glutamicumKCCM 80183 when used as nutritional additives in feed and water for drinking for all animal species. The active substance is L-lysine. Concentrated liquid L-lysine (base) and L-Lysine HCl produced by the strain C. glutamicumKCCM 80183 do not pose any safety concern as regards the genetic modification of the production strain. The use of the additives under assessment in supplementing feed to compensate for L-lysine deficiency in feeding stuffs is safe for the target species. The FEEDAP Panel has concerns about the use of amino acids in water for drinking for hygienic reasons, and due to the risk of imbalances when administered simultaneously via feed. The use of both forms of L-lysine produced by fermentation using C. glutamicumKCCM 80183 in animal nutrition is considered safe for the consumers and for the environment. Concentrated liquid L-lysine (base) produced by C. glutamicumKCCM 80183 is considered hazardous by inhalation, not irritant to skin and eyes and it is not a skin sensitiser. L-Lysine HCl produced by C. glutamicumKCCM 80183 is considered hazardous by inhalation, it is not irritant to skin but mildly irritant to eyes and it is not a skin sensitiser. The additives under assessment are considered as efficacious sources of the essential amino acid L-lysine for non-ruminant animal species. For the supplemental L-lysine to be as efficacious in ruminants as in non-ruminant species, it would require protection against degradation in the rumen. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of iron chelate of ethylenediamine for all animal species (Zinpro Animal Nutrition (Europe), Inc.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of iron chelate of ethylenediamine (Iron-EDA-Cl) as a feed additive for all animal species. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) identified several issues related to the data provided concerning the chemical characteristics of the additive. Based on the information provided, the FEEDAP Panel considered unlikely that the additive consists only of iron monochelate of EDA, but of several coexisting (iron) species; therefore, in the absence of adequate experimental data and owing to the uncertainties identified, the Panel cannot conclude on its identity and characterisation. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that the additive is safe for poultry for fattening and reared for laying/breeding, but cannot conclude on the safety for other animal species/categories. The FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the safety of the additive for the consumer or the environment. The FEEDAP Panel concludes that handling the additive poses a risk to users by inhalation. The additive should be considered as non-irritant for the skin but irritant for the eyes and skin sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel cannot conclude on the efficacy of the additive. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of the additive consisting of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens PTA-6507, B. amyloliquefaciens NRRL B-50013 and B. amyloliquefaciens NRRL B-50104 (trade name: Enviva PRO 202 GT) for turkeys for fattening. The product under assessment is based on viable spores of three strains originally identified as B. amyloliquefaciens which, in the course of the current assessment, were reclassified as Bacillus velezensis. The bacterial species B. velezensis is considered suitable for the qualified presumption of safety (QPS) approach to safety assessment. The identity of the active agents was established. The active agents do not harbour acquired antimicrobial resistance genes and lack toxigenic potential and the capacity to produce aminoglycosides. Following the QPS approach, the three bacterial strains are presumed safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. Since no concerns are expected from the other components of the additive, Enviva PRO 202 GT is also considered safe for the target species, consumers and the environment. Enviva PRO 202 GT is non-irritant to skin and eyes and is not a dermal sensitiser. Due to the proteinaceous nature of the active agents, the additive should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. In a previous opinion, it was concluded that Enviva PRO 202 GT has a potential to be efficacious as a zootechnical additive in chickens for fattening at the recommended level of 7.5*107 CFU/kg complete feed. It is considered that conclusions on efficacy of Enviva PRO 202 GT in chickens for fattening can be extrapolated to turkeys for fattening. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that Enviva PRO 202 GT has the potential to be efficacious in turkeys for fattening at 7.5*107 CFU/kg complete feed. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of chromium propionate (KemTRACE Chromium) for all growing poultry species (Kemin Europa NV).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, EFSA was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of chromium propionate (KemTRACE Chromium; KemTRACE-Cr) as zootechnical feed additive for all growing poultry species. The EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) Panel was assigned to this mandate. Based on two tolerance studies submitted, the Panel concluded that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening at the maximum recommended supplementation level of 0.4 mg Cr/kg feed from KemTRACE-Cr, but a margin of safety cannot be established; this conclusion can be extended to chickens reared for laying/breeding, but cannot be extrapolated to other growing poultry species. The FEEDAP Panel considered that the use of KemTRACE-Cr in animal nutrition at the proposed conditions of use is safe for the consumer. No concerns for users following any inhalation exposure during the handling of the additive are expected; the additive was shown to be corrosive to the eyes but not irritant to skin or a skin sensitiser. The use of KemTRACE-Cr in animal nutrition according to the proposed conditions of use will not significantly alter the concentration in the receiving environmental compartments of concern; therefore, no safety concern is expected for the environment. Based on three efficacy studies, the FEEDAP Panel concluded that KemTRACE-Cr has the potential to be efficacious as a zootechnical additive in chickens for fattening at the supplementation level of 0.4 mg Cr/kg feed; this conclusion could be extended to chickens reared for laying and chickens reared for breeding, and extrapolated to other poultry species for fattening and reared for laying/breeding. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the feed additive consisting of four bacteriophages infecting Salmonella Gallinarum B/00111 (PCM F/00069, PCM F/00070, PCM F/00071 and PCM F/00097, trade name: Bafasal) when used as a zootechnical additive in water for drinking and liquid complementary feed for all avian species. The effects sought are the reduction of the Salmonella spp. Carriage in chickens for fattening, the improvement of their performance, or both. The host strain harbours an acquired antimicrobial resistance gene. No viable cells or DNA from the host organism were found in the additive. The four phages proved to be strictly lytic and to have a machinery allowing to package a unit-length of the viral genome. The manufacturing process excludes the presence of remnants from the propagation process in the final additive. Consequently, no concerns are expected from the nature and manufacture of the product. Considering this and the results of the tolerance study with chickens for fattening, the Panel concluded that Bafasal is safe for all avian species. Considering the nature and manufacturing process of the additive, Bafasal is not expected to pose a risk for consumers. The results of the subchronic oral toxicity study and genotoxicity studies provided support this conclusion. Exposure of users via inhalation is expected to be low, but Bafasal should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. No conclusions were drawn on the irritancy of Bafasal to skin and eyes or on its dermal sensitisation potential due to lack of data. Considering the nature and manufacturing process of the additive, Bafasal is safe for the environment. The Panel was not in the position to conclude on the efficacy of Bafasal for any avian species due to insufficient data. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety of the feed additive consisting of manganese chelates of lysine and glutamic acid for all animal species (Zinpro Animal Nutrition).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety for target animals of manganese chelates of lysine and glutamic acid (Manganese-LG) as a nutritional feed additive for all animal species. The European Commission request followed an opinion of the FEEDAP Panel published in 2020; in that opinion, the FEEDAP Panel could conclude on the safety of the additive for chickens for fattening, but not for the rest of the target animals. The applicant submitted additional information to allow the FEEDAP Panel to complete its assessment; these additional data, comprising two tolerance studies (one with chickens for fattening and one with laying hens), were the subject of this opinion. The tolerance study in laying hens was not considered for the assessment since the housing conditions of the animals were not appropriate according to the relevant EU provisions. The results of the tolerance study in chickens for fattening showed that Manganese-LG at the highest level tested-800 mg Mn/kg feed-is safe for these target animals. The FEEDAP Panel also considered a previous tolerance study in chickens for fattening. Taking all the evidence together the Panel concluded that Manganese-LG is safe for chickens for fattening at 150 mg Mn/kg feed, with a margin of safety of 5.5. This conclusion can be extrapolated to all animal species and categories provided that the maximum authorised levels in the EU for total manganese in feed are not exceeded. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Efficacy of the feed additive consisting of amprolium hydrochloride (COXAM) for use in chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying (Huvepharma N.V.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the efficacy of amprolium hydrochloride (COXAM) for chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying. COXAM is a coccidiostat intended to be used to control coccidiosis in chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying up to 12 weeks of age at a dose of 125 mg amprolium hydrochloride (HCl)/kg complete feed. In its former opinion, the FEEDAP Panel was not in the position to conclude on the efficacy of COXAM for chickens for fattening and chickens reared for laying due to insufficient number of positive and significant effects on relevant parameters in one of the anticoccidial sensitivity tests (ASTs) evaluated. In the present submission, an additional AST has been provided by the applicant. In this study, challenge by an Eimeria inoculum of low pathogenicity indicated the coccidiostatic potential of amprolium HCl based on the reduction of intestinal lesions. Considering the results of three floor pen trials and two ASTs described and assessed in a previous EFSA opinion and taking into account the newly submitted AST, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that COXAM is efficacious in controlling coccidiosis in chickens for fattening at a dose of 125 mg amprolium HCl/kg complete feed. This conclusion is extended to chickens reared for laying. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of the seed husk of Plantago ovata Forssk. for use in cats and dogs (C.I.A.M.).		EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of the seed husk of Plantago ovata Forssk. When used as a sensory additive in feed for cats and dogs. The additive is described as a mixture of mucopolysaccharides and specification is given as swelling index ≥ 40, which is considered as the marker parameter.

EFSA Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP)				Safety and efficacy of a feed additive consisting of serine protease produced by Bacillus licheniformis DSM 19670 (Ronozyme ProAct) for chickens for fattening (DSM Nutritional Products Ltd.).		EFSA Journal					Ronozyme ProAct is the trade name of the feed additive under assessment and contains serine protease produced by a genetically modified strain of Bacillus licheniformis. Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Ronozyme ProAct when used as a zootechnical additive for chickens for fattening. The additive is available in coated thermotolerant granulated and liquid forms (Ronozyme ProAct CT/L). The production strain and its recombinant DNA were not detected in an intermediate concentrated product used to produce the final formulations. The final products do not trigger a safety concern with regard to the genetic modification. Based on the results obtained in a tolerance study in chickens for fattening and the data from a subchronic oral toxicity study the FEEDAP Panel concluded that the additive is safe for chickens for fattening. The FEEDAP Panel concluded that the use of Ronozyme ProAct CT/L as a feed additive gives rise to no concern for consumers and for the environment. The additive, in either form, is not an eye irritant but should be considered a skin irritant. In the absence of data, no conclusions on the skin sensitisation potential can be reached. Owing to the proteinaceous nature of the active substance it should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. The FEEDAP Panel also concluded that the additive has the potential to be efficacious at 15,000 PROT/kg compound feed for chickens for fattening. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA Journal					Following a request from the European Commission, the Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed (FEEDAP) was asked to deliver a scientific opinion on the safety and efficacy of Belfeed B MP/ML as a feed additive for sows in order to have benefits in piglets. The additive is to be used in to sows in order to have benefits in piglets and to all porcine species at any developmental stage at 10 IU/kg feed. This additive consists of endo-1,4-beta-xylanase produced by a genetically modified strain of Bacillus subtilis (LMG S-15136). In a previous opinion, the FEEDAP Panel could not conclude on the safety of the additive for the users regarding the potential of the additive as dermal sensitiser and on the efficacy of the additive when added to feed for sows in order to have benefits in piglets. In the absence of new information, the FEEDAP Panel retained its previous conclusion that the additive is not irritant to skin or eyes but should be considered a respiratory sensitiser. No conclusions could be drawn on its potential to be a dermal sensitiser. The applicant provided new efficacy data and complementary information regarding a previous study. Based on the previously assessed data and the newly submitted ones, the Panel concludes that although the additive has a potential to be efficacious as a zootechnical additive in sows during the lactation period at the level of 10 IU/kg feed, the data are considered not sufficient to conclude on a beneficial effect on the performance of the litters. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

J		Banach, J. L.; Zwietering, M. H.; Fels-Klerx, H. J. van der							Multi-criteria decision analysis to evaluate control strategies for preventing cross-contamination during fresh-cut lettuce washing.		Food Control					Several chemical disinfection strategies may be used to control cross-contamination of pathogens during fresh-cut produce washing. Deciding which strategy to select not only requires the use of technical information on the relevant criteria but can also make use of stakeholder perception. This study aimed to describe the application of a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to support decision-makers when determining a control strategy that best meets the views of various stakeholders and their possible conflicting interests. In this case study, five control strategies that can be used to treat the wash water, which comes in direct contact with the produce in the wash tank during processing, were examined. These strategies aimed to control pathogenic cross-contamination during fresh-cut lettuce washing at processors. These strategies included the use of free chlorine, chlorine dioxide, ozone, peracetic acid, or no wash water disinfectant. The performance analysis was based on five main criteria. Effectiveness, Technological aspects, Consumer acceptance, Economics, and Health. Scores for these criteria were evaluated using scientific literature, while the weights of the criteria were assessed using stakeholders. Results for the five control strategies were determined per stakeholder group, which included fresh-cut processors, producers and suppliers of disinfectants and equipment, scientists, and government representatives, as well as per individual. Stakeholders were shown to have different views on the relative importance of the criteria; however, the criterion "Health" was consistently considered most important. The ranking of the control strategies was similar for each stakeholder group and over stakeholders. Overall, the results showed that peracetic acid is the preferred control strategy. Based on the results of these analyses, the MCDA approach may assist in the complex decision to select a control strategy to control potential cross-contamination directly in the wash tank during fresh-cut lettuce washing by considering the different nature of the criteria and the perceptions of various stakeholder groups.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Treating soybean with proteases and subsequent fermentation increases the release of bioactive compounds that may be strongly attached to the food matrix. In our quest to choose the best material to develop an antihypertensive functional food from soybean, we assessed the ability of raw soybean, Prozyme 2000p-hydrolyzed soybean (PSB) and Enterococcus faecium EBD1-fermented PSB to inhibit angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). Treating soybean with Prozyme 2000p increased the ACE inhibitory ability from 15 3% to 40 2%. Subsequent fermentation of the hydrolyzed samples further increased the inhibitory ability to 80 5%. A discovery-based metabolomic approach using UHPLC Q-TOF MS/MS of the fermented sample showed that E. faecium fermentation increased the levels of phenolic compounds, gamma aminobutyric acid, antioxidant and antihypertensive peptides. The fermentation also increased the levels of essential amino acids relative to the enzyme treated and raw samples. The high levels of potential antihypertensive compounds in the fermented samples imply that fermenting Prozyme-treated soybean with Enterococcus faecium EBD1 would be a good strategy for developing functional foods with antihypertensive properties.

J		Banasaz, S.; Morozova, K.; Ferrentino, G.; Scampicchio, M.							The effect of microfluidization pressure and tocopherol content on the retention of vitamin a in oil-in-water emulsions.		Foods					This work investigates the oxidative stability of vitamin A encapsulated in oil-in-water emulsions, which were prepared by using a microfluidizer. All emulsions were prepared with a fixed content of vitamin A (525 M), corn oil (10%), water (90%), and whey protein (2%), but varying two main factors: the microfluidizer pressure (10, 50,100, 200 MPa) and the amount of alpha-tocopherol (0, 0.25, 0.50, 1.00 mg/g). The content of vitamin A before and after the microfluidization process, and during the subsequent five weeks of storage at 40 °C were determined by HPLC-DAD. The results of the analysis of variance performed either on the data obtained before and after the microfluidization process or during the storage showed that the highest stability of vitamin A was obtained with the highest content of alpha-tocopherol and with an applied pressure between 100 and 200 MPa. The highest stability was explained by the smaller particle size of the resulting oil droplets. However, high pressures (200 MPa) showed a negative effect on vitamin A retention. These results could be useful for future formulations of retinoids. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bancalari, E.; Martelli, F.; Bottari, B.; Neviani, E.; Gatti, M.							Arthrospira platensis extract: a non-invasive strategy to obtain adjunct attenuated cultures.		Foods					This study aims at proposing the use of Arthrospira platensis, commonly known as Spirulina, extract as a non-invasive method to attenuate the growth rate of non-starter adjunct cultures, thus preventing the over-acidification that may occur during cheese manufacturing. A preliminary screening using four different concentrations (0.20%, 0.30%, 0.50%, and 0.70%) of A. platensis extract and four starter and three non-starter lactic acid bacteria strains was performed by impedometric analysis. This allowed us to select one starter and one non-starter strain to be used in the in vitro simulation of a co-culture in milk with the best antimicrobial concentration (0.3%). The growth dynamics of the two selected strains, starter Lactococcus lactis 1426 and non-sarter Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1473, co-cultured for 120 h was monitored by three different approaches: (i) plate counting on M17, for the enumeration of lactococci, and MRS for lactobacilli; (ii) fluorescence microscopic counting of viable and non-viable coccoid Lactococcus lactis 1426 and rod-shaped Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 1473 cells; (iii) the overall estimation of co-culture growth behavior by impedometric parameters Lag, Rate, and yEnd. All the data obtained from the in vitro simulation were in agreement, revealing that a slowdown of non-starter growth occurred, while the starter strain was not affected, or slightly stimulated, from the antimicrobial presence. In particular, the growth of Lb. rhamnosus 1473 was delayed without adversely compromise the cells' integrity, connected with metabolic functions, showing a great potential for use in cheese production. © 2021 by the authors.

Characterization of virgin olive oils from Spanish olive varieties introduced in Mendoza, Argentina, and their comparison with the autochthonous variety.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The aim of this work was to evaluate and compare oil production and its quality in three Spanish olive varieties (Genovesa, Villalonga, and Nevadillo blanco) growing outside the Mediterranean basin with the Argentine autochthonous variety (Arauco). Fruit parameters and oil characteristics were evaluated using samples collected from the germplasm collection of Mendoza province and elaborated in the same place. Results. The levels of phenolic compounds and the fatty acid composition of the samples were comparable with those previously published for these Spanish varieties, grown in the Mediterranean basin, showing the adaptability of olive trees. Observing the levels of phenolic compounds and oxidative stability, a strong correlation between oxidative stability and oleocanthal was observed. Conclusion. The characteristics of the fruit and oil differed according to variety and season. The inter-harvest stability was different depending on the variety. Genovesa was observed to be the most stable variety according to its fruit and oil characteristics-even more stable than the autochthonous variety, Arauco. However, in terms of the composition of phenolic compounds, Arauco was the most stable between harvests, this characteristic being more important for the taste and uniformity of the product. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

J		Bandini, T. B.; Spisso, B. F.							Development and validation of an LC-HRMS method for the determination of pyrrolizidine alkaloids and quinolones in honey employing a simple alkaline sample dilution.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Honey residue and contaminant assessments are extremely important, as they deal with food and therapeutic safety issues of a widely consumed animal product. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are secondary plant metabolites used by bees in honey production. The toxicity of these alkaloids has been discussed in the literature and health risks have been noted, due to their occurrence in both honey and in pyrrolizidine alkaloid-producing plants. Quinolones comprise a class of antimicrobials associated with hypersensitivity reactions and bacterial resistance, one of the world's most significant public health problems. In this context, the aim of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous presence of pyrrolizidine alkaloids and quinolones in different honey types. A simple and novel analytical method employing liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry using a quadrupole-time-of-flight hybrid analyzer (Q-TOF) was developed and validated. No quinolone residues were detected in 80 honey samples, while pyrrolizidine alkaloids were found in 49% of the investigated samples. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Food Science & Nutrition					The alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD) has been a severe public health problem. Oxidative stress is involved in the initiation and progression of AFLD. Tea is a popular beverage worldwide with strong antioxidant activity. In this research, our purpose is to explore and compare the effects of 12 selected teas on AFLD. The ethanol liquid diet was used to feed the mice, and 12 tea extracts were administrated at 200 mg/kg body weight every day for 4 weeks. The results showed that the application of several tea extracts exhibited different inhibitory effects on lipid accumulation induced by sub-acute alcohol consumption based on the determination of triglyceride concentration and the histological alteration in the liver. In addition, several teas significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activities, inhibited the cytochrome P450 2E1 expression, and promoted alcohol metabolism (p< .05). Besides, compared with the model group, several teas obviously elevated superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activities as well as glutathione content, and remarkably decreased malondialdehyde level (p<.05). In general, Fried Green Tea, Fenghuang Narcissus Oolong Tea, and Pu-erh Dark Tea possessed potential preventive effects on AFLD. Moreover, the main phytochemicals in the three tea extracts were determined and quantified via high-performance liquid chromatography, and the most commonly detected ingredients were catechins and caffeine, which could exert the protective effects on AFLD. © 2021 The Authors.

Foods					Gut microbiota dysbiosis has been a crucial contributor to the pathogenesis of alcoholic fatty liver disease (AFLD). Tea is a popular beverage worldwide and exerts antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, as well as hepatoprotective effects. However, the potential role of gut microbiota regulated by tea in the prevention and management of AFLD remains unclear. Here, the protective effects of oolong tea, black tea, and dark tea on AFLD and its regulation of gut microbiota in chronic alcohol-exposed mice were explored and investigated. The results revealed that tea supplementation significantly prevented liver steatosis, decreased oxidative stress and inflammation, and modulated gut microbiota in chronic alcohol-exposed mice, especially oolong tea and dark tea. However, black tea showed less effectiveness against liver injury caused by alcohol. Moreover, the diversity, structure and composition of chronic alcohol-disrupted gut microbiota were restored by the supplementation of oolong tea and dark tea based on the analysis of gut microbiota. Furthermore, the relationship between liver injury biochemical indicators and gut microbiota indicated that some specific bacteria, such as Bacteroides, Alloprevotella, and Parabacteroides were closely associated with AFLD. In addition, the phytochemical components in tea extracts were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, which could contribute to preventive effects on AFLD. In summary, oolong tea and dark tea could prevent chronic alcohol exposure-induced AFLD by modulating gut microbiota. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bangyan Liu; Yue Tang; Yuxia Yang; Yuangen Wu							Design an aptamer-based sensitive lateral flow biosensor for rapid determination of isocarbophos pesticide in foods.		Food Control					Rapid, sensitive, point-of-care detection of isocarbophos is extremely important in food safety. Herein, a new aptamer-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) has been designed and developed for isocarbophos detection. The SS2-55 aptamer serves as alternative recognition element instead of antibodies in this LFB, and it was conjugated to the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to achieve a highly sensitive and specific isocarbophos probe. The SS2-55 aptamer can interact with isocarbophos pesticide and desorb from the surface of AuNPs in the probe, leading to the capture of free AuNPs by cysteamine that immobilized on the test (T) line of the LFB. The designed LFB has a detection limit as low as 2.48 mug L-1, and shows high selectivity for isocarbophos over other control pesticides. Notably, the designed LFB can distinguish whether isocarbophos exceeds the permissible level in less than 1 min even by the naked eyes. The detection results in actual samples show that the designed LFB has good accuracy and practicability, indicating its bright application prospects in the rapid analysis of pesticide residues.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Thermal and dry salt-curing processing are traditional methods for processing Prunus mume fruits (PMF) into food or medicine. This study aimed to investigate the composition of free and bound phenolics in PMF, and effects of thermal and dry salt-curing processing on phenolic profiles, antioxidant activity and bioaccessibility. Nineteen (free and bound) phenolic compounds were identified and quantified in raw PMF. Salt-curing caused a significant decrease in free and bound phenolic content, whereas no significant change was observed after thermal treatment. The concentration and distribution of individual phenolic compounds instead of composition in PMF were changed by thermal and salt-curing processing. The two processing methods differently decreased DPPH and ABTS antioxidant activity. The total phenolic bioaccessibility increased by 34.09% after thermal processing, while decreased by 87.92% after salt-curing. These results may indicate that thermal rather than salt-curing is more preferably method for processing PMF to developing health foods and nutraceuticals.

J		Banjac, V.; Vukmirovic, D.; Pezo, L.; Draganovic, V.; Duragic, O.; Colovic, R.							Impact of variability in protein content of sunflower meal on the extrusion process and physical quality of the extruded salmonid feed.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					This study aimed to characterize sunflower meal (SFM) with a protein content of ~370g/kg per dry matter (SFM1) and its two high protein fractions obtained by air classification (SFM2 and SFM3 containing 430 and 490g/kg of protein per dry matter, respectively) as aqua feed ingredient, based on their functional properties that are important for extrusion processing. A mixture design was applied, varying the levels of SFM1, SFM2 and SFM3 from 88.2 to 267.2 g/kg in dry feed mixes intended for trout. SFM1 presence in the diet caused higher flow resistance of the material in the extruder barrel, and thus higher energy consumption compared to extrusion of diets containing SFM2 and SFM3. SFM1 suppressed the product expansion but induced formation of hollow and brittle pellets with high oil absorption capacity. Increase in protein content of SFM led to more compact structure, resulting in increased hardness, durability, water stability, and decreased oil leakage. Besides better nutritional quality, air classified low fiber SFMs prevail over basic SFM also in terms of their functionality. Still, presence of high fiber SFM could improve physical attributes of pellets in terms of their oil absorption capacity, important characteristic for salmonid feeds. Practical Applications. Identification of functional properties of a certain ingredient is an important task when evaluating a novel ingredient in fish feed industry. This study assessed functionality of dehulled high protein sunflower meals, obtained by air classification, in the aqua feed extrusion process. The inclusion of sunflower meal with protein content higher than 400g/kg, at level up to 200g/kg, increased rigidity, water stability and oil retention ability of pellets, while decreased input of mechanical energy during extrusion. The contemporary aqua feed industry is oriented toward low fishmeal/high plant-based diets. In this respect the outcomes of this study indicate that dehulled sunflower meal could be used as an alternative protein source to fishmeal in aqua feed from technological standpoint with beneficial effects on process parameters and without impaired effects on pellet physical quality. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	44	3			1745-4530				10.1111/jfpe.13640					FSTA:2021-07-Ng1507

Oleic acid contents of almond kernel oils were determined between 61.39% (Ne Plus Ultra) and 73.51% (Texas), linoleic acid contents of oil samples varied between 16.02% (Masbovera) and 30.60% (Ne Plus Ultra). Gallic acid, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, (+)-catechin, 1,2-dihydroxybenzene, syringic acid, caffeic acid, and quercetin were the key phenolic constituents of kernels showed partly differences depending on almond varieties. Almond kernels are rich in K, P, Ca, Mg, Na, and S elements. Practical applications. Almonds are used as ingredients in a variety of processed foods such as bakery and confectionery products, almond milk, and almond fermented milk. The roasted almond kernels used in desserts, salads, and ice-creams is a popular snack in Turkey. Almonds are considered to be a valuable source of plant proteins in the human diet. Almonds have recognized health benefits, due to high fatty acids, phenolics, and proteins. The most important unsaturated fatty acids of almond oils are oleic and linoleic acids. Phenolic compounds comprise a large and heterogeneous group of secondary plant metabolites distributed widely throughout the plant kingdom. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

W. den							Heterogeneity in single-cell outgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes in half Fraser enrichment broth is affected by strain variability and physiological state.		Food Research International					The behaviour of pathogens at the single-cell level can be highly variable and can thus affect the detection efficacy of enrichment-based detection methods. The outgrowth of single cells of three Listeria monocytogenes strains was monitored after fluorescence-activated single-cell sorting in non-selective brain heart infusion (BHI) broth and selective half Fraser enrichment broth (HFB) to quantify outgrowth heterogeneity and its effect on the detection probability. Single-cell heterogeneity was higher in HFB compared to non-selective BHI and heterogeneity increased further when cells were heat-stressed. The increase in heterogeneity was also strain-dependent because the fast-recovering strain Scott A showed less outgrowth heterogeneity than the slower-recovering strains EGDe and H7962. Modelling of the outgrowth kinetics during the primary enrichment demonstrated that starting at low cell concentrations could fail detection of L. monocytogenes at least partly due to cell heterogeneity. This highlights that it is important to take single-cell heterogeneity into account when optimizing enrichment formulations and procedures when L. monocytogenes contamination levels are low.

W. den							Variability in lag duration of Listeria monocytogenes strains in half Fraser enrichment broth after stress affects the detection efficacy using the ISO 11290-1 method.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					A collection of 23 Listeria monocytogenes strains of clinical and food origin was tested for their ability to recover and grow out in half Fraser enrichment broth following the ISO 11290-1:2017 protocol. Recovery of sub-lethally heat-injured cells in half Fraser broth was compared to reference cells with no stress pre-treatment. The enrichments were followed over time by plate counts and the growth parameters were estimated with the 3-phase model which described the data best. The reference cells without stress pre-treatment showed a short lag duration, which ranged from 1.4 to 2.7 h. However, significant variation in the ability to recover after 60 °C heat stress was observed among the tested strains and resulted in a lag duration from 4.7 to 15.8 h. A subset of strains was also exposed to low-temperature acid stress, and the lag duration showed to be also stress dependent. Scenario analyses and Monte Carlo simulations were carried out using the growth parameters obtained in the enrichments. This demonstrated that when starting with one cell, the detection threshold for efficient transfer of at least one cell to the secondary enrichment step, i.e. 2 log10 CFU/ml, was not reached by 11 of 23 strains tested (48%) after exposure to 60 °C heat stress. Increasing the incubation time from 24 to 26 h and the transfer volume from 0.1 to 1.0 ml can increase the average probability to transfer at least one cell to the secondary enrichment step from 79.9% to 99.0%. When optimizing enrichment procedures, it is crucial to take strain variability into account as this can have a significant impact on the detection efficacy. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Low-molecular-weight seaweed-derived polysaccharides lead to increased faecal bulk but do not alter human gut health markers.		Foods					Seaweeds are potentially sustainable crops and are receiving significant interest because of their rich bioactive compound content; including fatty acids, polyphenols, carotenoids, and complex polysaccharides. However, there is little information on the in vivo effects on gut health of the polysaccharides and their low-molecular-weight derivatives. Herein, we describe the first investigation into the prebiotic potential of low-molecular-weight polysaccharides (LMWPs) derived from alginate and agar in order to validate their in vivo efficacy. We conducted a randomized; placebo-controlled trial testing the impact of alginate and agar LWMPs on faecal weight and other markers of gut health and on composition of gut microbiota. We show that these LMWPs led to significantly increased faecal bulk (20-30%). Analysis of gut microbiome composition by sequencing indicated no significant changes attributable to treatment at the phylum and family level, although FISH analysis showed an increase in Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in subjects consuming agar LMWP. Sequence analysis of gut bacteria corroborated with the FISH data, indicating that alginate and agar LWMPs do not alter human gut microbiome health markers. Crucially, our findings suggest an urgent need for robust and rigorous human in vivo testing-in particular, using refined seaweed extracts. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Banovic, M.; Sveinsdottir, K.							Importance of being analogue: female attitudes towards meat analogue containing rapeseed protein.		Food Control					With the fast rising population, the discussion focused around need for novel sustainable protein sources and meat replacement is also increasing. Meat analogues have already taken important place in this discussion with a fast growth of meat analogue industry. Rapeseed (or canola) is very promising alternative source of a novel protein on the plant-based market that can be used as a meat analogue ingredient. However, meat analogues containing rapeseed protein can only be successful if these products are acceptable to consumers. This study presents results of a cross-cultural study from five European countries on female consumers' attitudes towards meat analogue containing rapeseed protein, who are also regular meat consumers. The results suggest that consumers' attitude towards meat analogue was significantly influenced by the attitude towards its main ingredient, rapeseed protein. These effects were similar across investigated countries pointing to the fact that main ingredient of the meat analogue, rapeseed protein, defines and differentiates meat analogue delineating consumer acceptance. Nevertheless, consumers' intention to substitute meat protein in the diet is another crucial component for forming consumers' attitudes towards meat analogues and their acceptance, while the effect of attitude towards using plant protein in food production was less prominent. The results advise that in order to make meat analogue more acceptable to meat consumers, the focus should be on the main meat analogue ingredient where the consumers' intention to substitute meat protein in the diet could boost or inhibit this acceptance.

J		Banovic, M.; Aschemann-Witzel, J.; Deliza, R.							Taste perceptions mediate the effect of a health goal on food choice.		Food Quality and Preference					Although considerable research has been done on the role of a health goal in food choices, little effort is devoted to the contexts intervening between the health goal and choices and its relationship with taste and price in the congruent non-conflicting versus the incongruent conflicting choice context. The present research experimentally examined through an online study, with 1303 participants, the process through which the health goal affects food choices taking into account both the congruent non-conflicting and the incongruent conflicting choice contexts. Furthermore, the study examined whether the impact of the health goal on these choices would be mediated by taste perceptions evoked by the products' imagery. Results show that when the health goal is activated in a non-conflicting (vs. conflicting) choice context, the consumers are more likely to choose more expensive (vs. cheaper) products. The consumers' expected product taste further mediate this effect of the health goal on the product choice, where a non-conflicting (vs. conflicting) choice-set additionally intensifies the consumers' taste perceptions, producing a congruent healthy-tasty relationship. These findings suggest that the health goals do not always invoke incongruence with taste, at least in the context of products perceived as naturally healthy. For a broader market, this effect could actually be a blessing in disguise, where health-related communication efforts effectively inducing congruence with taste, would be more capable of catering the consumers' food choices.

J		Banovic, M.; Barone, A. M.							The hybrid enigma: the importance of self-construal for the effectiveness of communication messages promoting sustainable behaviour.		Food Quality and Preference					Transition towards more sustainable diets is imminent and marketers are looking for guidance on type of the advertising appeal that could effectively persuade consumers to buy products that could support this transition, such as hybrid products. While prior research has investigated the value of self-interest/-transcendent goal appeals and independent/interdependent self-construal, only a small number of studies have investigated these factors in combination. Therefore, we conducted a representative cross-national study involving almost 2000 consumers from Denmark, Spain, and the UK, to experimentally investigate the effect of self-interest (health) vs. Self-transcendent goal (environment) and independent vs. Interdependent self-construal on consumers' attitudes. The results showed that perceived product quality mediates the effect of goals on consumers' product attitudes, such that messages focused on the environment are more effective when interdependent self-construal is activated, while messages leveraging on health are more effective when independent self-construal is activated. This research suggests that advertising efforts and communication campaigns that rely on consumers" goals should account for self-construal to induce higher levels of perceived product quality and efficiently boost consumers" product attitudes and purchase behaviour.

J		Banovic, M.; Otterbring, T.							Athletic abs or big bellies: the impact of imagery, arousal levels, and health consciousness on consumers' attitudes towards plant-based protein products.		Food Quality and Preference					Research suggests that health-related imagery influences consumers' product attitudes, and that both appetitive, positively framed and aversive, negatively framed imagery can be used to boost health-related responses. Arousal has been suggested as a mechanism driving such responses, but few studies in food-related consumer research have examined the link between arousal and consumers' product attitudes. The present cross-national study, involving almost 1000 consumers (N=959) from Denmark, Germany, Spain, and the UK, experimentally investigated whether prior exposure to healthy (vs. Unhealthy) imagery influences consumers' attitudes towards a plant-based protein product. Furthermore, the study examined whether the impact of imagery type on consumers' product attitudes would be mediated by the arousal levels evoked by the imagery, and whether this presumed effect would be moderated by health consciousness. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the imagery conditions (healthy, unhealthy), after which they stated their arousal levels, product attitudes, health consciousness, and product-related emotions. The results revealed that arousal mediates the impact of exposure to healthy (vs. Unhealthy) imagery on consumers' product attitudes, such that healthy imagery outperforms unhealthy imagery. This effect was particularly powerful among health conscious consumers. Taken together, these findings suggest that reliance on communication campaigns, advertising efforts, and marketing messages that induces arousal seems to effectively bolster consumers' product attitudes, with potential downstream effects on purchase and choice behavior.

International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The use of millet in the production of gluten-free sourdough has significant benefits such as its suitability for individuals with gluten sensitivity. Lactic acid bacteria and yeasts were screened for functional properties from unmalted and malted millet for sourdough preparation. Lactobacillus plantarum MLd27 and Pichia kudriavzevii MYd23 were selected, used individually and mixed starter cultures to produce sourdough. The specific volume (3.070.06 cm3 g-1) of the bread made with unmalted flour and Pichia kudriavzevii MYd23 was significantly higher (P< 0.05) compared to all the other samples. The protein, ash and fibre contents of the bread samples ranged from 10.1 to 11.4,2.2 to 4.5 and 1.45 to 1.74 g/100 g, respectively. The sourdough bread samples were generally acceptable, while spontaneously fermented bread from malted flour showed the significantly highest (P< 0.05) overall acceptability of (7.90). The production of gluten-free millet sourdough bread can aid in food security. © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

J		Bao, M.; Cipriani, P.; Giulietti, L.; Drivenes, N.; Levsen, A.							Quality issues related to the presence of the fish parasitic nematode Hysterothylacium aduncum in export shipments of fresh Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua).		Food Control					The parasitic nematode Hysterothylacium aduncum commonly occurs in many fish species in the Northeast (NE) Atlantic. The parasite is considered non-pathogenic to humans. During spring and summer of 2018, lots of head-on eviscerated fresh NE Arctic cod (Gadus morhua) were shipped from Norway to Spain for commercialization. At arrival, the presence of lively roundworms (i.e.H. aduncum) in the transporting boxes was noticed. Consequently, fish lots were rejected causing substantial monetary losses to all involved parties. As part of the hazard assessment process, the epidemiology of H. aduncum in cod, NE Arctic saithe (Pollachius virens) and NE Arctic haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) fished off West-Finnmark, Norway, was studied. Parasites were morphologically and molecularly identified to species level. Additionally, the viability of H. aduncum was assessed by simulating the conditions that prevail during transport of fresh cod to European market. The infection values of L4 larval stage or adult H. aduncum in the digestive tract of fish were highly variable, ranging from 100% prevalence with mean abundance (range) 238 (10-1092) in cod to 27% prevalence with mean abundance (range) 1 (0-22) in haddock. Fishing season was identified as most important explanatory factor for parasite abundance. Infection levels were higher during winter and early spring, and lower during late spring. Infection peaks of H. aduncum in the three fish species seemed to coincide with heavy predation on spawning capelin (Mallotus villosus) during winter and early spring. Thorough evisceration seems to remove most of the nematodes from the fish. However, parasites may remain hidden within the head cavities where they can stay alive and active under regular transport conditions for at least 14 days. Hysterothylacium aduncum can be completely removed from the product by evisceration, beheading and rinsing the fish prior to shipping. Alternatively, thorough cleaning or completely removal of the gills and pharynx may be considered. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Food Hydrocolloids					Changes in the structural and physicochemical properties of quinoa starch during germination were investigated. The amylose content of Zhongli No. 1 quinoa (ZQ) was 17.37%, which was almost 4-5 times greater than the other two genotypes. The surface of germinated quinoa starch granules showed more pinholes and obvious crimples than native starch. The germinated Mengli No. 1 quinoa starch (MQS) and Yunnan red quinoa starch (YQS) had a higher ratio of short chains than native starch, while the opposite result was observed in Zhongli No. 1 quinoa starch (ZQS). Germination decreased the relative crystallinity of starch, but it did not change its crystalline structure type. Peak viscosity, trough viscosity, retrogradation enthalpy and the percentage of retrogradation significantly decreased during germination. In conclusion, germination significantly impacted on the structural and physicochemical properties of quinoa starch, which provides a basis for the utilization of germinated quinoa products in the food industry.

Food Chemistry					Pickering emulsions stabilized by zein/carboxymethyl dextrin nanoparticles were added to the kappa-carrageenan-based gel matrix to prepare emulsion gels via EDC-induced covalent crosslinking. Texture, WHC and freeze-thaw stability of the emulsion gels increased after crosslinking. The Confocal laser scanning microscope and SEM suggested that droplet clusters could be observed in gel with higher concentration of emulsion. The rheological measurements indicated that the viscosity and gel-like structure were relied on crosslinking agent and emulsion concentration. The photothermal stability of curcumin was significantly enhanced after crosslinking. In addition, in vitro digestion study suggested that the bioaccessibility of curcumin in emulsion gel crosslinked was lower compared to emulsion gel without crosslinking agent. These studies might facilitate the preparation of emulsion gels with excellent stability for bioactive compounds delivery in food and pharmaceutical applications.

Food Chemistry					Bacteria release membrane vesicles into the extracellular environment but which activity is unclear. We investigated the applications of extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum to protect tuna fish against spoilage and quality loss in this study. A significant difference was found in EVs size obtained from L. plantarum after 8, 24, and 48 hr incubation. The L. plantarum-derived EVs were collected and used to confirm the anti-bacterial activity versus Shewanella putrefaciens. Finally, the tuna fish was stored at 4 °C for 5 days after coating with EVs or sodium erythorbate, and the quality indexes were assayed. Results indicated that EVs markedly inhibited oxidation reaction, total volatile base nitrogen (TVBN), peroxide value (PV), malondialdehyde (MDA), and bacteria levels. These results finding out that EVs from L. plantarum may have potential for application in food storage technology. Overall, we indicated this new material may be developed as an anti-bacterial agent for prolonging the shelf life of tuna fish.

Foods					Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is a large intestine disease caused by toxins produced by the spore-forming bacterium C. difficile, which belongs to Gram-positive bacillus. Using antibiotics treatment disturbances in the gut microbiota and toxins produced by C. difficile disrupt the intestinal barrier. Some evidence indicates fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics may decrease the risk of CDI recurrence. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of fermented mango by using the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus acidophilus and develop innovative products in the form of fermented mango jam. L. acidophilus-fermented mango products inhibited the growth of C. difficile while promoting the growth of next-generation probiotic Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Both supernatant and precipitate of mango-fermented products prevented cell death in gut enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells against C. difficile infection. Mango-fermented products also protected gut barrier function by elevating the expression of tight junction proteins. Moreover, L. acidophilus-fermented mango jam with high hydrostatic pressure treatment had favorable textural characteristics and sensory quality. © 2021 by the authors.

Foods					Polysaccharides isolated from fungus Cordyceps militaris display multi-biofunctions, such as immunostimulation, down-regulation of hyperlipidemia, and anti-cancer function. The occurrence of obesity and metabolic syndrome is related to the imbalance of gut microbiota. In this study, the effects of C. militaris and its fractions on modifying metabolic syndrome in mice were evaluated. Mice were fed a high-fat/high-sucrose diet (HFSD) for 14 weeks to induce body weight increase and hyperlipidemia symptoms in mice, and then the mice were simultaneously given a HFSD and C. militaris samples for a further 8 weeks. The results indicated that the fruit body, polysaccharides, and cordycepin obtained from C. militaris had different efficacies on regulating metabolic syndrome and gut microbiota in HFSD-treated mice. Polysaccharides derived from C. militaris decreased the levels of blood sugar and serum lipids in mice fed HFSD. In addition, C. militaris-polysaccharide treatment obviously improved intestinal dysbiosis through promoting the population of next generation probiotic Akkermansia muciniphila in the gut of mice fed HFSD. In conclusion, polysaccharides derived from C. militaris have the potential to act as dietary supplements and health food products for modifying the gut microbiota to improve the metabolic syndrome. © 2021 by the authors.

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Obesity is a major public health and economic problem of global significance. Here, we investigate the role of diosmetin, a natural flavonoid presents mainly in citrus fruits, in the regulation of obesity and metabolic dysfunctions in mice. Methods and Results. Eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) or 5-week-old male ob/ob mice fed a normal diet are treated with diosmetin (50 mg kg-1 daily) or vehicle for 8 weeks. Diosmetin treatment decreases body weight and fat mass, improves glucose tolerance and insulin resistance in obese mice. These metabolic benefits are mainly attributed to increase energy expenditure via enhancing thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and browning of white adipose tissue (WAT). Mechanistically, diosmetin acts as an agonist for estrogen receptors (ERs), and subsequently elevates adipose expressions of ERs in mice and in cultured adipocytes. When ERs are blocked by their antagonist fulvestrant in mice, diosmetin loses its beneficial effects, suggesting that ERs are indispensable for the metabolic benefits of diosmetin. Conclusion. The results indicate that diosmetin may be a potential anti-obesity nutritional supplement and could be explored for low ERs-related obesity populations. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	17			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202100070					FSTA:2021-12-Jc17248

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					An efficient and simple method for determining vanillin, methyl vanillin and ethyl vanillin in milk and dairy products was developed using a liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure coupled to high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Different extraction procedures were tested and optimised by spiking three vanillin compounds into a blank matrix in which none of any food additives were detected, and the extraction with acetonitrile solution and n-hexane as cleaning sorbent allowed an efficient recovery of 87.6-101.7% with RSDs less than 5%. The limit of detection (LOD) ranged from 6.2 to 20.1 mug/kg. High sensitivity, accuracy and selectivity were found for the in-house validated method, which can eliminate the interferences from complicated matrices effectively, and fulfil the quality criteria for routine laboratory application for real samples. The developed method was then finally applied to screen the three analytes in 65 milk and dairy products including infant formula milk powders from local markets to check for compliance with Chinese Regulation. Concentrations of the total vanillin and ethyl vanillin ranged from 0.0323 to 246.3 mg/kg, which is within the limits of Chinese regulations. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.										2021	38	7	1096	1104	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2021.1902573					FSTA:2021-10-Gc5801

Effect of 1-MCP and ethylene absorbent on the development of lenticel disorder of "Xinli No. 7" pear and possible mechanisms.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. A common lenticel disorder which occurs in the peel of "Xinli No. 7" pears (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.) had not previously been described. Symptoms of this lenticel disorder include enlarging and bulging of the lenticels which results in significant commercial losses. Understanding the physiological basis of lenticel disorder and developing practical methods to control it is crucial for the successful marketing of this pear. Results. The development of this lenticel disorder was found to be closely related to the endogenous ethylene production during storage. 1-Methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) combined with an ethylene absorbent (EA) treatment was found to significantly reduce the development of the disorder by inhibiting the expression of ethylene related genes, PbACS1, PbACS2 and PbACO. It is proposed that the enlarged lenticels may result from increased lignin accumulation in the peel cells, which is inhibited by this combined postharvest treatment. It was shown that the expression of six lignin related genes decreased following the treatment. The results suggest that PbPAL, Pb4CL and PbCAD could be critical in regulating the development of this lenticel disorder. Conclusion. Endogenous ethylene plays a key role in the development of this lenticel disorder in "Xinli No. 7" pear. The enlarged lenticels which is characteristic of this disorder maybe related to increased lignin accumulation in the peel cells, which were inhibited with 1-MCP combined with an EA treatment. These results provide a practical method for managing the development of lenticel disorder in "Xinli No. 7" pear and helps clarify the developmental mechanisms of this disorder. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	6	2525	2533	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10879					FSTA:2021-07-Je8860

M.; Bhesh Bhandari; Cunshan Zhou; Haile Ma							Effect of multi-mode dual-frequency ultrasound irradiation on the degradation of waxy corn starch in a gelatinized state.		Food Hydrocolloids					Ultrasound as "green chemistry and technology" can considerably modify the component, structure, and properties of starches derived from diverse plants. In the current study, the effect of ultrasound frequency modes on the degradation of gelatinized waxy corn starch (GWCS) was investigated. The frequency modes include single-frequency modes of 20,40 kHz (SM-20 and SM-40), and dual-frequency of 20 and 40 kHz in sequential mode (SeDM) and simultaneous mode (SiDM). Results. Showed that ultrasound irradiation significantly decreased (p< 0.05) the Mw of GWCS under all the frequency modes compared to the native starch. Besides, reductions in Mw enhanced by dual-frequency ultrasound were higher than those enhanced by single-frequency ultrasound. For dual-frequency modes, the reductions in Mw of SiDM were higher than those of SeDM, indicating that the degradation of SiDM was the most serious. The significant decreases in the proportion of B3 chains, and increases in the proportion of A chains of GWCS irradiated by ultrasound indicated that the larger molecules were preferentially degraded. The results of 1H NMR spectroscopy showed that both alpha-1,4-and alpha-1,6-glycosidic bonds of starch were damaged by ultrasound irradiation, and the degree of branching (DB) of GWCS irradiated by SiDM was the lowest. In conclusion, the dual-frequency ultrasound can be used as an efficient and low-cost method to facilitate the degradation of amylopectin.

J		Baoguo Xu; Jianan Chen; Jun Yuan; Roknul Azam, S. M.; Min Zhang							Effect of different thawing methods on the efficiency and quality attributes of frozen red radish.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The thawing process is regarded as an essential step before the consumption of frozen foods. This study aimed to evaluate the possibility of ultrasound thawing of frozen red radish and to explore the characteristics of ultrasound thawing. The influence of low-frequency ultrasound (LFU) on the thawing efficiency of frozen red radish cylinders in air and water mediums was investigated. The effects of different ways of thawing, including air thawing (AT), water thawing (WT), refrigeration thawing (RT), ultrasound-assisted water thawing (UWT), and microwave thawing (MT) on the thawing time and quality of radish samples was studied. Results. The results showed that thawing time decreased remarkably in air and water mediums assisted by LFU. As the LFU power level increased, the thawing time decreased and the value of the drip loss increased. The firmness of thawed radish samples also decreased significantly compared with the fresh samples. Microwave thawing had the highest thawing rate, but the microstructure of MT radish samples was damaged severely, resulting in the highest drip loss, and the lowest firmness, and vitamin C content. In comparison with the AT, WT, and RT, a significant reduction in thawing time could be achieved for UWT (P<0.05). Ultrasound-assisted water thawing exhibited the highest retention of color and vitamin C, and a lower destructive effect on the microstructure. Conclusion. The results showed that LFU could be used as an efficient method to facilitate the thawing process of frozen red radishes, and better preserve the color, vitamin C, and microstructure of the final product. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	8	3237	3245	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10953					FSTA:2021-09-Jk11972

Food & Function					A high-fat diet (HFD) promotes tissue inflammation, oxidative stress and insulin resistance (IR), thereby contributing to the development of obesity and diabetes. Anthocyanins from Lycium ruthenicum (AC) have demonstrated anti-obesity effects and modulated IR. To investigate the mechanism by which AC attenuates the adverse effects of consuming a HFD, C57BL/6J mice were fed a HFD supplemented with AC or a control diet without AC for 12 weeks. AC supplementation decreased the amount of weight gain, hepatic lipid, and sequentially improved dyslipidemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and IR in HFD-fed mice. Molecular data revealed that AC inhibited hepatic inflammation by reducing TLR4/NF-kappaB/JNK in the liver tissues and ameliorated oxidative stress by activating the Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 pathway. Thus, AC might activate IRS-1/AKT and prevent HFD-induced gluconeogenesis and IR by ameliorating inflammation and oxidative stress. Modulation of inflammation and oxidative stress with AC may represent a promising target for the treatment of IR and provide insight into the mechanism by which AC protects against obesity. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.										2021	12	9	3855	3871	2042-650X				10.1039/d0fo02936j					FSTA:2021-09-Jf11788

Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Gut barrier dysfunction and inflammation originating from a dysbiotic gut microbiota (GM) are strongly associated with a high-fat diet (HFD). Anthocyanins from Lycium ruthenicum (ACs) show antiobesity effects through modulating the GM. However, the mechanism linking the antiobesity effects of ACs and GM modulation remains obscure. Methods and results. To investigate the ameliorative effects of ACs on colonic barrier dysfunction and inflammation, mice are fed an HFD with or without ACs at doses of 50,100, and 200 mg kg-1 for 12 weeks. AC supplementation reduced weight gain, enriched short-chain fatty acid (SCFA)-producing bacteria (e.g., Ruminococcaceae, Muribaculaceae, Akkermansia, Ruminococcaceae_ UCG-014, and Bacteroides) and SCFA content, depleted endotoxin-producing bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter and Desulfovibrionaceae), and decreased endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide) levels. SCFAs substantially activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPRs), inhibited histone deacetylases (HDAC), increased intestinal tight junction mRNA and protein expression levels, reduced intestinal permeability, and protected intestinal barrier integrity in HFD-induced mice. These effects mitigate intestinal inflammation by inhibiting the LPS/NF-kappaB/TLR4 pathway. Conclusion. These data indicates that ACs can mitigate colonic barrier dysfunction and inflammation, induce SCFA production and inhibit endotoxin production by modulating the GM in HFD-fed mice. This finding provides a clue for understanding the antiobesity effects of ACs. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	65	8			1613-4133				10.1002/mnfr.202000745					FSTA:2021-08-Jf10448
J		Baoping Yang; Xiao Dong Chen; Mercade-Prieto, R.							Stress relaxation of particulate whey protein hydrogels.		Food Hydrocolloids					The relaxation mechanics of hydrogels depend on how stresses are dissipated: through the polymeric network, through the flow of the entrapped solvent, or through both mechanisms. Particulate protein hydrogels, prepared from whey proteins at pH 7 and 0.1 M NaCl, were investigated using micro-relaxation tests to investigate the role of the microstructure. When deforming gels at high velocities (~400 mum/s), there is little relaxation during loading and the subsequent extensive relaxation is identified to be poroelastic by using different indenter sizes. The effective diffusivity and solvent permeability are estimated to be ~6*10-9 m2/s and 5*10-17 m2 respectively, which are one magnitude order larger than in protein hydrogels with a stranded microstructure. When indenting gels at low speeds (~20 mum/s), the poroelastic relaxation due to solvent flow occurs mostly during the loading step, and the subsequent relaxation is mostly viscoelastic in nature. Particulate protein gels, therefore, present two well identified and separated relaxation regimes.

Theaflavins prevent the onset of diabetes through ameliorating glucose tolerance mediated by promoted incretin secretion in spontaneous diabetic Torii rats.		Journal of Functional Foods					The in vivo anti-hyperglycemic effect of non-absorbable theaflavins, polyphenolic ingredients of black tea, was evaluated in spontaneously diabetic Torii (SDT) rats. A mixture of theaflavins (25 mg/kg/day) was administered to 8-week (wk)-old SDT rats for 20 weeks, showing to improve the impaired glucose tolerance of 22-wk old pre-diabetic SDT rats in both an oral glucose tolerance test and in a plasma insulin evaluation. At 28-wk diabetic SDT rats presented with increased fasting blood glucose levels (139 23 mg/dL), and the intake of the theaflavins significantly (p< 0.05) reduced this effect (74 11 mg/dL), demonstrating an anti-diabetic effect in vivo. The 20 week administration of theaflavins induced increased incretin secretion compared to that of the control, while there were no changes neither in dipeptidyl peptidase-IV activity nor glucose transporter expression. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that non-absorbable theaflavins exert anti-pre-diabetic and anti-diabetic effects by improving impaired insulin secretion.

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. The non-grain crop cassava has attracted intense attention in the biorefinery process. However, efficient biorefinery of whole cassava is faced with some challenges due to the existence of strain inhibition and refractory cellulose during the citrate production process. Results. Here, a novel breeding method-atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP)-was applied for strain improvement of citrate-producing strain Aspergillus niger from whole cassava. The citrate yield of the mutant obtained using ARTP mutagenesis increased by 36.5% in comparison with the original strain. Moreover, citric acid fermentation was further improved on the basis of an enhanced co-saccharification strategy by supplementing glucoamylase and cellulase. The fermentation efficiency increased by 35.8% with a 17.0 gL-1 reduction in residual sugar on a pilot scale. Conclusions. All these results confirmed that a combination of the novel breeding method and enhanced co-saccharification strategy could be used to efficiently refine whole cassava. The results also provide inspiration for the production of value-added products and waste disposal in agro-based industries. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	11	4613	4620	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11104					FSTA:2021-10-Bi1603

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Protecting the intestinal mucosa from being destroyed helps reduce the inflammation caused by acute pancreatitis (AP). In this study, whether okra pectin (OP) could attenuate the inflammation of AP through protecting the intestinal barrier was investigated. Results. OP was obtained from crude okra pectin (COP) through the purification by DEAE cellulose 52 column. Supplementation with OP or COP in advance reduced the severity of AP, as revealed by lower serum amylase and lipase levels, abated pancreatic edema, attenuated myeloperoxidase activity and pancreas histology. OP or COP inhibited the production of pancreatic proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6. In addition, the upregulation of AP-related proteins including ZO-1, occludin, the antibacterial peptide-defensin-1 (DEFB1) and cathelicidin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), as well as the histological examination of colon injuries, demonstrated that OP or COP provision could effectively maintain intestinal barrier function. Ultimately, dietary OP or COP supplementation could inhibit AP-induced intestinal inflammation. For the above, the effect of OP was better than COP. Conclusion. Dietary OP supplementation could be considered as a preventive method that effectively interferes with intestinal damage and attenuates inflammatory responses trigged by AP. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	3	863	870	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10693					FSTA:2021-05-Jq6227

Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					In the present study, a novel material rotator was designed to evaluate the possibilities to improve radio frequency (RF) heating uniformity in raisins. The rotator provided a means to rotate materials when subjected to RF heating. The results showed that RF heating uniformity was significantly (p< 0.05) improved with the rotation of raisins. The relative heating uniformity parameter (lambda) reduced to less than 15% at rotational speed of 40 and 60 rpm. No significant (p> 0.05) influence on heating rate was observed. Pasteurization experiments showed the total bacterial (4.88 log) count was reduced by 2.55 log CFU/g and the molds (4.83 log) were completely inactivated when raisins were heated to 80 °C and maintained for 10 min, which indicated a great disinfection efficiency of RF heating. Quality evaluation showed the physiochemical property changes of raisins were satisfied with acceptable color and nutrients loss. Therefore, the method used in this experiment could be expanded to develop an effective treatment protocol for controlling microorganisms in raisins.

Food Hydrocolloids					The complexes of soluble starch and whey protein isolate (WPI) were prepared and used to stabilize high internal phase emulsion (HIPE). Ultraviolet absorption and fluorescence analyses confirmed that the starch/WPI complexes were formed. These complexes were formed by hydrophobic interaction. Through appearance, micro-morphology, particle size, and rheological properties analyses, it was found that stable HIPE could be prepared by the starch/WPI complex when the addition of starch reached 7.5%. In addition, beta-carotene in the WPI-stabilized HIPE was completely degraded after 72 h of ultraviolet irradiation, while beta-carotene in the starch/WPI complex-stabilized HIPE still had a retention rate of 17.95%. Finally, the stability of the starch/WPI complex-stabilized HIPE was explored. The starch/WPI complex-stabilized HIPE was more stable in acidic environments, but the possible exception was the pI of the WPI. Particularly, this HIPE was stable at high ionic strengths. These results suggested that starch was able to improve the emulsifying ability of WPI.

Journal of AOAC International					Background. For years, turmeric has been used in several cuisines worldwide because of its proven health benefits. However, as its cultivation often involves applications of polar and semi-polar pesticides, their residues might cause health hazards to consumers. The dearth of a validated LC-MS/MS method for the residue analysis of these pesticides in turmeric has warranted the present study. Objective. The aim was to develop and validate a multi-residue method for simultaneous determination of multi-class pesticides in turmeric (both rhizome and powder) by LC-MS/MS. Method. Both the rhizome and powder samples (1 kg) were soaked in water for 30 min, followed by homogenization. Each homogenate (2 g) was mixed with 10 mL water, and extracted with acetonitrile (10 mL) in the presence of acetic acid and NaCl. The extract was cleaned by using dispersive solid phase extraction (dSPE) with graphitized carbon (5 mg/mL) sorbent. The cleaned extract was measured by LC-MS/MS with a runtime of 20 min. The method was validated on 211 multi-class pesticides. Results. The method performance was satisfactory at 10 ng/g and higher levels, in compliance with the SANTE/12682/2019 guidelines. The dSPE cleanup was effective in minimizing the matrix effects. The use of matrix-matched calibrations specific for turmeric powder and rhizome corrected all recoveries within the satisfactory range of 70-120%. The precision-RSDs were <20% for all test pesticides. The Horwitz ratio and measurement uncertainty results were satisfactory as well. Conclusions. As the method was convenient, selective, accurate, and repeatable, it is recommended for regulatory and commercial testing purposes. Highlights. For the first time, this study reports a validated LC-MS/MS method for the multi-residue analysis of pesticides in turmeric. The method provided a high throughput analysis of multi-class pesticides in turmeric rhizome and powder matrices with satisfactory selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. The method performance satisfied the requirements of the SANTE/12682/2019 guidelines, and the method sensitivity complied with the EU-MRL requirements. © AOAC INTERNATIONAL 2020.

Galactose to tagatose isomerization by the l-arabinose isomerase from Bacillus subtilis: a biorefinery approach for Gelidium sesquipedale valorisation.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Tagatose is a rare sugar with increasing commercial interest as sweetener. Biotechnological production of D-tagatose by enzymatic isomerization of D-galactose provides an alternative to chemical processes. In the last years, L-arabinose isomerases (L-AIs) from different origins have been studied to increase the effectiveness of tagatose production. In this work, the L-AI from Bacillus subtilis, previously reported to have unique substrate specificity for L-arabinose, was expressed in Escherichia coli and studied for isomerization of D-galactose to D-tagatose. The recombinant enzyme demonstrated, for the first time, tagatose bioconversion capacity, reaching ~59% conversion. Furthermore, a sustainable tagatose production strategy was developed by using Gelidium sesquipedale red seaweed and its undervalued processing residues as source of galactose. L-AI successfully converted the galactose-rich hydrolysate, obtained from direct acid hydrolysis of seaweed, to tagatose (50.9% conversion). Additionally, the process combining autohydrolysis of G. sesquipedale and acid hydrolysis of the remaining residue allowed a full integral valorisation of polysaccharides: 13.33 g of agar, an important hydrocolloid, coupled with the production of 5.97 g of tagatose. These results confirmed that seaweed biomass and waste-derived are promising substrates for tagatose production by L-AI , contributing to the advancement of circular economy and to the actual needs of food industry.

Food Chemistry					Coffee quality is determined by several factors and, in the chemometric domain, the multi-block data analysis methods are valuable to study multiple information describing the same samples. In this industrial study, the Common Dimension (ComDim) multi-block method was applied to evaluate metabolite fingerprints, near-infrared spectra, sensory properties, and quality parameters of coffee blends of different cup and roasting profiles and to search relationships between these multiple data blocks. Data fusion-based Principal Component Analysis was not effective in exploiting multiple data blocks like ComDim. However, when a multi-block was applied to explore the data sets, it was possible to demonstrate relationships between the methods and techniques investigated and the importance of each block or criterion involved in the industrial quality control of coffee. Coffee blends were distinguished based on their qualities and metabolite composition. Blends with high cup quality and lower roasting degrees were generally differentiated from those with opposite characteristics.

Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Quorum quenching (QQ) is the ability to interfere with bacterial cell to cell communication, known as quorum sensing (QS). QQ enzymes that degrade or modify acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) have been attracting increasing interest as promising agents for inhibiting QS-mediated bacterial pathogenicity. Plant pathogens from the genus Erwinia cause diseases in several economically important crops. Fire blight is a devastating plant disease caused by Erwinia amylovora, affecting a wide range of host species within the Rosaceae and posing a major global threat for commercial apple and pear production. While QS has been described in Erwinia species, no AHL-degrading enzymes were identified and characterized. Here, phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling were applied to identify an AHL lactonase in E. amylovora (dubbed EaAiiA). Following recombinant expression and purification, the enzyme was biochemically characterized. EaAiiA lactonase activity was dependent on metal ions and effectively degraded AHLs with high catalytic efficiency. Its highest specific activity (kcat/KM value) was observed against one of the AHLs (3-oxo-C6-homoserine lactone) secreted from E. amylovora. Exogenous addition of the purified enzyme to cultures of E. amylovora reduced the formation of levan, a QS-regulated virulence factor, by 40% and the transcription level of the levansucrase-encoding gene by 55%. Furthermore, preincubation of E. amylovora cultures with EaAiiA inhibited the progress of fire blight symptoms in immature Pyrus communis fruits. These results demonstrate the ability of the identified enzyme from E. amylovora to act as a quorum-quenching lactonase.										2021	69	20	5652	5662	0021-8561				10.1021/acs.jafc.1c00366					FSTA:2021-10-Je13283

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sustainable, bio-based emulsifications stored as dry particles and conveniently converted to edible re-dispersible emulsions are of increasing interest in the food, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals industries. Dried sunflower oil emulsions (98 g/100 g) oil content that are conveniently re-dispersible, were prepared from a complex of regenerated chitin (RCh) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (K100M) via Pickering emulsion. The concentration of RCh and K100M (0.25-1.0 g/100 g) on the formulation of emulsions droplets, stability, and viscoelastic properties were investigated. The results showed the emulsion droplets decreased with the increasing concentration of RCh and K100M, which led to an increase in the emulsion stability. The emulsions prepared dried without oil leakage and were easily redispersible after the freeze or oven-drying. Compared to the freshly prepared emulsions before drying, the re-dispersed emulsions from freeze-/oven-drying consisted of similar symmetrically spherical-shaped droplets with a slight increase in size. The marked stability of such emulsions was attributed to highly networked RCh systems both for fresh and re-dispersed emulsions confirmed by results of rheology and long-term stability. Therefore, such dried edible emulsions containing sustainable, bio-based RCh/K100M emulsifiers have a significant potential for many applications. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

K.; Bija Wang; Xueling Feng; Zhiping Mao; Xiaofeng Sui							Stable sunflower oil oleogel from oil/water pickering emulsion with regenerated chitin.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Pickering emulsion templating is a versatile technique in formulating highly networked oil-in-water emulsions applicable in foods, cosmetics, and pharmaceuticals areas. In this work, oleogels was prepared by oil-in-water Pickering emulsions using regenerated chitin (RCh) as the stabilizing particles. The effects of RCh concentrations (0.4/100-1.4 g/100 g) on the formation, rheology, and log-term stability of the emulsions and oleogles were investigated. It was found that the solid-like oloegel with a high concentration of liquid oil (≥98 g/100 g) could be obtained after evaporating of water from the emulsions. Shear-thinning behavior was observed at lower concentrations of RCh (0.4-0.6 g/100 g) and higher frequencies in the emulsions. An increase in the viscoelastic property was achieved. Oleogels containing higher concentrations of RCh (0.8/100-1.4 g/100 g) showed excellent resistance against coalescence and Ostwald ripening during the storage time. These oleogels also showed good thermal stability (no sign of oil leakages) when heated to 80 °C for 2 days. This emulsion templating approach is a feasible oil structuring strategy promising to be used in various applications. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Journal of Cereal Science					Rice is consumed in the form of different products. The present study reported the extractable and free form of phenolic acids and flavonoid profile from different processed products (popped, beaten, puffed and boiled rice) of four black rice cultivars (Chakhao, Kalobhat, Mamihunger. Manipuri Black) along with a white rice variety (Swarna sub-1) as reference. In addition, vitamin-E, gamma-oryzanol, anthocyanin, phytic acids and antioxidant activity were also examined. The HPLC-PDA analysis of phenol extracts detected 14 phenolic compounds comprising of 4 hydroxybenzoic acid, 5 hydroxycinnamic acid and 5 flavonoids in most of the products with their higher content in black rice based products than that of reference cultivar. Among the different products, popped rice ranked first in terms of mean phenolic compounds (467.74 mug/g) of which 54% occurring in free form, vitamin-E, gamma-oryzanol and antioxidant activity. Boiled rice had the least amount of all these components. Based on PCA, popped rice of MN was identified as a promising product that could contribute to potential health benefits.

J		Baran Das, A.; Vaibhav V. Goud; Chandan Das							Influence of extrusion cooking on phytochemical, physical and sorption isotherm properties of rice extrudate infused with microencapsulated anthocyanin.		Food Science and Biotechnology					The effect of extrusion cooking on the quality of rice extrudate with infused microencapsulated anthocyanin was investigated. The moisture sorption isotherm of the extrudate was also studied. The rotatable central composite design was used to optimize the extrusion process and the optimized conditions were: screw speed, 121 rpm; barrel temperature, 91.89 °C; and moisture content, 22.03%. The extrudate showed anthocyanin content of 0.218 mg/L; true density, 1.48 g/cc; water activity 0.51, water solubility index, 7.49%; and specific mechanical energy, 31.39 kJ/kg. The antioxidant activity and solubility of the extrudate were higher as compared with native extrudate. The moisture sorption isotherm of the extrudate was found to follow type III isotherm behavior according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller classification. The sorption isotherm was analyzed using several models and the Caurie and Peleg models were best fitted with the extrudate isotherm data. The present work manifested a way to develop antioxidant rich extrudate. ©The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology 2020.										2021	30	1	65	76	1226-7708				10.1007/s10068-020-00841-4					FSTA:2021-05-Me2858

Four types of TiO2 reduced the growth of selected lactic acid bacteria strains.		Foods					Food-grade titanium dioxide (TiO2) containing a nanoparticle fraction (TiO2 NPs-nanoparticles) is widely used as a food additive (E171 in the EU). In recent years, it has increasingly been raising controversies as to the presence or absence of its harmful effects on the gastrointestinal microbiota. The complexity and variability of microbiota species present in the human gastrointestinal tract impede the assessment of the impact of food additives on this ecosystem. As unicellular organisms, bacteria are a very convenient research model for investigation of the toxicity of nanoparticles. We examined the effect of TiO2 (three types of food-grade E171 and one TiO2 NPs, 21 nm) on the growth of 17 strains of lactic acid bacteria colonizing the human digestive tract. Each bacterial strain was treated with TiO2 at four concentrations (60,150, 300, and 600 mg/L TiO2). The differences in the growth of the individual strains were caused by the type and concentration of TiO2. It was shown that the growth of a majority of the analyzed strains was decreased by the application of E171 and TiO2 NPs already at the concentration of 150 and 300 mg/L. At the highest dose (600 mg/L) of the nanoparticles, the reactions of the bacteria to the different TiO2 types used in the experiment varied. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Baratossy, G.; Donko, M. B.; Vasarhelyi, H. C.; Heberger, K.; Racz, A.							Comprehensive classification and regression modeling of wine samples using 1H NMR spectra.		Foods					Recently, 1H NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy was presented as a viable option for the quality assurance of foods and beverages, such as wine products. Here, a complex chemometric analysis of red and white wine samples was carried out based on their1H NMR spectra. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning algorithm was applied for the wine variety classification with an iterative double cross-validation loop, developed during the present work. In the case of red wines, Cabernet Franc, Merlot and Blue Frankish samples were successfully classified. Three very common white wine varieties were selected and classified: Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling. The models were robust and were validated against overfitting with iterative randomization tests. Moreover, four novel partial least-squares (PLS) regression models were constructed to predict the major quantitative parameters of the wines: density, total alcohol, total sugar and total SO2 concentrations. All the models performed successfully, with R2 values above 0.80 in almost every case, providing additional information about the wine samples for the quality control of the products.1H NMR spectra combined with chemometric modeling can be a good and reliable candidate for the replacement of the time-consuming traditional standards, not just in wine analysis, but also in other aspects of food science. © 2020 by the authors.

J		Barba, F. J.							An integrated approach for the valorization of cheese whey.		Foods					Taking into account the large amount of whey that is produced during the cheese production process and the constant demand by society for more sustainable processes, in accordance with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the circular economy concept, it is necessary to adapt two-unit operations into a single process, allowing us to not only valorize a part of the whey but the whole process, which is known as bioprocess integration. In this sense, the adaptation of different processes, for example, physicochemical (micro, ultra and nanofiltration) and fermentation, that are commonly used to obtain proteins, lactose and other compounds with different activities (antioxidant, antifungal, etc.) could be integrated to achieve a complete recovery of the cheese whey. Likewise, keeping in mind that one of the main drawbacks of cheese whey is the great microbial load, some innovative processing technologies, such as high hydrostatic pressures, electrotechnologies and ultrasound, can allow both the development of new foods from whey as well as the improvement of the nutritional and organoleptic properties of the final products prepared with cheese, and thus reducing the microbial load and obtaining a safe product could be incorporated in the cheese whey valorization process. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Barber, E.; Houghton, M. J.; Williamson, G.							Flavonoids as human intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.		Foods					Certain flavonoids can influence glucose metabolism by inhibiting enzymes involved in carbohydrate digestion and suppressing intestinal glucose absorption. In this study, four structurally-related flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, quercetagetin and galangin) were evaluated individually for their ability to inhibit human alpha-glucosidases (sucrase, maltase and isomaltase), and were compared with the antidiabetic drug acarbose and the flavan-3-ol (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Cell-free extracts from human intestinal Caco-2/TC7 cells were used as the enzyme source and products were quantified chromatographically with high accuracy, precision and sensitivity. Acarbose inhibited sucrase, maltase and isomaltase with IC50 values of 1.65, 13.9 and 39.1 M, respectively. A similar inhibition pattern, but with comparatively higher values, was observed with EGCG. Of the flavonols, quercetagetin was the strongest inhibitor of alpha-glucosidases, with inhibition constants approaching those of acarbose, followed by galangin and kaempferol, while the weakest were quercetin and EGCG. The varied inhibitory effects of flavonols against human alpha-glucosidases depend on their structures, the enzyme source and substrates employed. The flavonols were more effective than EGCG, but less so than acarbose, and so may be useful in regulating sugar digestion and postprandial glycaemia without the side effects associated with acarbose treatment. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Quality and Preference					Research interest in the acceptability of insects as food has dramatically grown in recent years. Investigators have studied the antecedents of people willingness to eat whole insects, processed (non-visible) insects, and insect-fed animals as well. Another important topic is the difference between intention to try insect-based foods once, and readiness to adopt these foods in everyday diet. In 2020, the Entomophagy Attitude Questionnaire has been developed as a tool for researchers in this area. It is the only one self-report questionnaire specific to entomophagy, multi-dimensional, and cross-validated in diverse contexts and languages. The current study contributes to further validate this instrument in Spanish, in a novel context such as Chile, and to expand its nomological validity to intention to eat processed insects. In addition, results show that the three components of the EAQ significantly predict participants' intention to try insect-based foods and, to a lesser extent, intention to add insect-based food in one own's diet. Limitations of the study, as well as direction for further research are discussed in the paper.

J		Barberi, G.; Gonzalez-Alonso, V.; Spilimbergo, S.; Barolo, M.; Zambon, A.; Facco, P.							Optimization of the appearance quality in CO2 processed ready-to-eat carrots through image analysis.		Foods					A high-pressure CO2 process applied to ready-to-eat food products guarantees an increase of both their microbial safety and shelf-life. However, the treatment often produces unwanted changes in the visual appearance of products depending on the adopted process conditions. Accordingly, the alteration of the visual appearance influences consumers' perception and acceptability. This study aims at identifying the optimal treatment conditions in terms of visual appearance by using an artificial vision system. The developed methodology was applied to fresh-cut carrots (Daucus carota) as the test product. The results showed that carrots packaged in 100% CO2 and subsequently treated at 6 MPa and 40°C for 15min maintained an appearance similar to the fresh product for up to 7 days of storage at 4°C. Mild appearance changes were identified at 7 and 14 days of storage in the processed products. Microbiological analysis performed on the optimal treatment condition showed the microbiological stability of the samples up to 14 days of storage at 4°C. The artificial vision system, successfully applied to the CO2 pasteurization process, can easily be applied to any food process involving changes in the appearance of any food product. © 2021 by the authors.

Mediterranean spontaneously fermented sausages: spotlight on microbiological and quality features to exploit their bacterial biodiversity.		Foods					The wide array of spontaneously fermented sausages of the Mediterranean area can represent a reservoir of microbial biodiversity and can be an important source of new technological and functional strains able to preserve product properties, counteracting the impoverishment of their organoleptic typical features due to the introduction of commercial starter cultures. We analysed 15 artisanal salamis from Italy, Spain, Croatia and Slovenia to evaluate the microbiota composition, through culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques (i.e., metagenomic analysis), chemical-physical features, biogenic amines and aroma profile. The final pH varied according to origin and procedures (e.g., higher pH in Italian samples due to long ripening and mold growth). Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and coagulase-negative cocci (CNC) were the dominant population, with highest LAB counts in Croatian and Italian samples. Metagenomic analysis showed high variability in qualitative and quantitative microbial composition: among LAB, Latilactobacillus sakei was the dominant species, but Companilactobacillus spp. was present in high amounts (45-55% of the total ASVs) in some Spanish sausages. Among staphylococci, S. epidermidis, S. equorum, S. saprophyticus, S. succinus and S. xylosus were detected. As far as biogenic amines, tyramine was always present, while histamine was found only in two Spanish samples. These results can valorize the bacterial genetic heritage present in Mediterranean products, to find new candidates of autochthonous starter cultures or bioprotective agents. © 2021 by the authors.

D. de							Positioning of design elements on the packaging of frozen convenience food and consumers' levels of attention: an experiment using pizza boxes.		Food Quality and Preference					In this paper, we investigate how the positioning of design elements influences the level of attention that consumers pay to the packaging of convenience food. We carry out a laboratory experiment with ninety-eight individuals and use physiological measurements, obtained by eye-tracking methods, to assess levels of attention, proxied by fixation count. The participants are exposed to different combinations of four individual elements (image, logo, flavor, and quick product information) distributed among the four quadrants (top-right, top-left, bottom-right and bottom-left) of the packaging to measure which of these positions catches consumers' attention the most. In line with the literature on the design of packaging, we show that the position of the image, logo and flavor attributes consistently alters consumers' attention levels. No effect is found for the quick information element. We argue that such findings may guide brand managers and product designers to propose more appealing packaging to optimize potential market success. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Re-visiting the occurrence of mislabeling in frozen "pescada-branca" (Cynoscion leiarchus and Plagioscion squamosissimus - Sciaenidae) sold in Brazil using DNA barcoding and octaplex PCR assay.		Food Research International					In Brazil, Cynoscion leiarchus and Plagioscion squamosissimus are the species allowed to be labeled as "pescada-branca". These species have high economic value, especially when sold in the form of fillets. Therefore, when morphological traits are removed, fish are highly prone to be substituted, which has been reported for species of the family Sciaenidae sold in Brazil, including "pescada-branca". We have sequenced 618 bp of the COI of 143 samples to re-evaluate the occurrence of substitutions in frozen "pescada-branca" marketed in Brazil. We observed more than 73% of mislabeling, with only 26.57% being P. squamosissimus, and none, C. leiarchus. In general, the substitutes were closely related Sciaenidae, but cheaper species, which indicates commercial fraud. Based on these results we used 1.2 kb of COI to develop an octaplex PCR assay that unequivocally identified the target species and six substitute species through the banding pattern. Specific reverse primers combined with a universal forward primer were used in the protocol and identified the species C. leiarchus (~290 bp), N. microps (~340 bp), M. ancylodon (~470 bp), C. acoupa (~540 bp), C. microlepidotus (~850 bp), P. auratus (~950 bp), C. virescens (~1050 bp), and P. squamosissimus (~1140 bp). The DNA barcoding and the multiplex PCR were accurate and specific to authenticate processed products labeled as "pescada-branca". The multiplex assay constitutes a cost-effective alternative for the authentication of these products and other sciaenids. Additionally, we suggest that the multiplex assay can be adopted by both companies and regulatory agencies to prevent commercial fraud in the marketing of processed fishery products in Brazil and other countries where these products are commercialized.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Kombucha is a drink produced by spontaneous fermentation, and several studies have been conducted to unveil its microbiological and physicochemical aspects with numerous human health claims. The integration of these results is fundamental to understand and discuss the biological activities attributed to kombucha. In the present study, we isolated bacteria and yeasts involved in the fermentation of kombucha produced with green (GK) and black (BK) teas, as well as the amplicon metagenomic of the microbial communities (16S and ITS) during 0, 3, 5, 10, and 15 days of fermentation, at 28 °C. Microbial communities were linked to key biochemical parameters monitored during fermentation such as pH, total titratable acidity, total reducing sugars, polyphenols, acetic acid, and ethanol production. Moreover, ordination analysis (principal component analysis, PCA) revealed clear GK and BK separation groups during the fermentation process. Caffein, gallic acid, and chlorogenic acids majorly influenced the separation of GK and BK. Furthermore, the presence of Komagataeibacter spp. and catechins exerted selective pressure against microbial contamination. This study essentially contributes to the knowledge about the effects of integrated microbiota to the chemical results of the kombucha fermented in GK and BK teas. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Industrial fruits by-products and their antioxidant profile: can they be exploited for industrial food applications?		Foods					Fruit by-products have a low economic value and have proven biological activities, such as antioxidant capacity due to the presence of active compounds. The main objective of this study was to obtain and determine the antioxidant capacity, through DPPH radical assay and beta-carotene bleaching assay, of three food grade extracts from apple, lemon, and orange industrial by-products. Furthermore, the extracts were characterized by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). LC with diode array detector (LC-DAD) was used for the quantification of the main polyphenols. Lemon extract presented the highest inhibition percentage of DPPH radical (51.7%) and the highest total phenolics content (43.4 mg GAE/g) from the by-products studied. Orange by-product was that with the higher number of polyphenols while lemon extract was that with the highest content of individual phenolics. The by-product obtained from the lemon was that with higher amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids (407 g/g of by-product), mainly chlorogenic acid (386.7 g/g), followed by the apple by-product (128.0 g/g of by-product), which showed higher amounts of rosmarinic and chlorogenic acids. These industrial by-products have great potential as a source of natural antioxidants to be used directly as food additives or to be incorporated in packaging to produce active food packaging. © 2021 by the authors.

Journal of Food Safety					The aim of the study was to evaluate the overall hygienic-sanitary conditions of university hospitals foodservices and assess food safety knowledge and self-reported practices of food handlers. A self-administered questionnaire based on sanitary standards for foodservices was given to 123 food handlers from three public hospitals. Microbiological analysis of food handling surfaces and food hygiene inspections were also performed. Food handlers' self-reported knowledge and practices reached satisfactory levels (77.2% and 78.1%, respectively), and showed a significant positive intercorrelation (p<.05). Food hygiene inspections in the hospitals foodservices presented a 60.9% average of adequacy and microbiological analysis results showed that 66.7% of the evaluated surfaces presented significant contamination by mesophilic bacteria. The presence of coliforms at 45 °C above the safety limit was identified in 47.9% of the surfaces. The results showed a need for motivating hospital food handlers to practice the safe handling knowledge that they have demonstrated in theory. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Barbosa, G. B.; Minguillan, J. M. O.							Antioxidant activity and total phenolic content of fresh and cured rhizomes of Curcuma longa and Etlingera philippinensis.		International Food Research Journal					The search for effective natural antioxidants has been increasing nowadays due to human health concern. Further investigation of the Zingiberaceae plants such as Etlingera philippinensis, a Philippine endemic plant, and Curcuma longa (turmeric) is key towards alleviating this concern. The present work aimed to provide fundamental information on the total antioxidant activity (TAA), total phenolic content (TPC), and curcumin content of the ethanolic extracts of the fresh and cured rhizomes of C. longa and E. philippinensis. Healthy and fresh rhizomes of E. philippinensis were collected from Kibawe, Bukidnon, while C. longa were from Musuan, Bukidnon, Philippines. TAA determination was done using phosphomolybdenum method, while TPC and curcumin content using spectrophotometric method. Results showed that the TAA of fresh and cured rhizomes of C. longa were significantly higher than those of fresh and cured rhizomes of E. philippinensis. The TPC of fresh and cured rhizomes of C. longa were significantly higher than those of fresh and cured rhizomes of E. philippinensis. Significantly higher curcumin content was also observed in the rhizomes of C. longa as compared to that in the fresh and cured rhizomes of E. philippinensis. Generally, the ethanolic extracts of the cured rhizomes of E. philippinensis and C. longa exhibited higher TAA, TPC, and curcumin content than the fresh one. TAA, TPC, and curcumin were significantly correlated with each other. It can thus be concluded that E. philippinensis could also be a source of valuable curcumin.										2021	28	4	839	847	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-12-Te5039

Effect of light, food additives and heat on the stability of sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanins in model beverages.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					This work aimed to evaluate the stability of sorghum 3-deoxyanthocyanins (DXA) in model beverages (pH 3.5) elaborated with crude sorghum phenolic extract, containing ascorbic acid and sulphite, under fluorescent light exposure and subjected to heat treatment. There was no significant difference in the DXA degradation during storage under light exposure (24.16%) and absence of light (20.72%). DXA degradation did not differ in the presence of ascorbic acid during storage under light exposure (23.99-25.38%) and absence of light (19.87-21.74%). The addition of sulphite caused an initial bleaching reaction, but as a reversible reaction, the anthocyanin content was higher on the last day of storage compared to the first day. There were no significant differences in total anthocyanin content of all treatments subjected to the heat treatment (80 °C for 5 and 25 min). Thus, crude DXA are very stable under light, additives and heat, and may be useful as natural food colourants. © 2021 Institute of Food Science and Technology.

Enzyme-assisted extraction of flavanones from citrus pomace: obtention of natural compounds with anti-virulence and anti-adhesive effect against Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium.		Food Control					Food poisoning has been recognized as a global challenge, causing illness in millions of people. Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium is a major foodborne pathogen causing disease in humans by expressing virulence genes to invade the host epithelial cells. Thus, the search for natural compounds with anti-virulence and anti-adhesive effect could help to mitigate Salmonella infection. This study aimed to determine the effect of flavanones on S. Typhimurium virulence and adhesion to Caco-2 cells. Flavanones were obtained from citrus pomace (CP) by enzyme-assisted (CP-E) and conventional hydroalcoholic (CP-H) extraction methods, which produced extracts rich in aglycones and glycosylated flavanones, respectively. CP-E and aglycone standards (naringenin and hesperetin) decreased bacterial growth (25-90%), motility (50-90%), and adhesion to Caco-2 cells (25-50%). CP-H and glycosylated flavanones (naringin and hesperidin) affected only bacterial adhesion (decreased 20-75%). Agglutination assays demonstrated the binding of extracts and pure flavanones to S. Typhimurium adhesion structures. Fimbrial gene expression (fimA and fimZ) was downregulated in the presence of CP-H, CP-E, and aglycones. Both CP extracts decreased the expression of genes associated with cell invasion (hilA, ssrB and sopD). These results suggest that CP extracts and flavanones inhibit S. Typhimurium adhesion by interacting with fimbriae and flagella structures and downregulating fimbrial and virulence genes. CP-E and aglycone flavanones, rarely found in nature, exhibited superior inhibitory effects on bacterial viability, motility, adhesion and virulence gene expression than glycosylated flavanones. The outcomes of this research advance the understanding of how aglycone and glycosylated flavanones impact S. Typhimurium virulence activity and adhesion, contributing to their application as functional food ingredients for the prevention of adhesion, invasion, and the development of this pathogen in the gut.

Food Chemistry					Nanoencapsulation provides new alternatives for the food industry, enabling a controlled and slow release of active antimicrobial agents, such as essential oils (EO). Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) nanocapsules loaded with linalool EO were prepared using an extrusion method with 1, 3, and 5% w/v (PBAT to chloroform). Nanocapsules' sizes ranged from 100 to 250 nm and were spherical. The release profile was studied using an ethanoic medium over 24 h, and according to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, a Fick diffusion mechanism was involved. FT-IR and thermogravimetric analyses confirmed EO encapsulation with an encapsulation efficiency of 55%, 71%, and 74% for 1, 3, and 5%, respectively. The results indicated that encapsulation depended on organic phase concentration, with higher PBAT contents achieving better results. The resulting nanocapsules had antimicrobial activity against E. coli, which could be extended to develop active packaging systems.

Characterization of Rosewood and Cinnamon Cassia essential oil polymeric capsules: stability, loading efficiency, release rate and antimicrobial properties.		Food Control					In this study, Rosewood and Cinnamon essential oils (EO) were encapsulated using Tween 80 and poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) as wall material. Capsules were obtained after solvent evaporation and evaluated by Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Loading Efficiency (LE), Release, and Antimicrobial tests. SEM results showed that capsules' morphology was spherical with dimensions in the micrometer scale. Rosewood capsules presented agglomeration effects, while Cinnamon showed fewer defects. TGA for capsules presented a thermal event associated with encapsulated EO, which shows that the encapsulation process was successful. The LE was 11 and 29 %wt, for Rosewood and Cinnamon capsules, respectively. Those results are associated with the physical and chemical properties of the EO main compounds and their interaction with PBAT chemical structure. Therefore, it can be concluded that the nature of EO impacts the capsules' stability and LE. The release mechanism was adjusted according to the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, which shows an EO obeys Fickian diffusion process. The antimicrobial test showed significant inhibition against Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica, and Staphylococcus aureus. The effectiveness observed against these microorganisms could be applied to extend shelf life of food products by its incorporation into edible or thin films with food contact.

Antrocaryon amazonicum: an unexploited Amazonian fruit with high potential of scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.		Journal of Food Science					Antrocaryon amazonicum fruits are unexploited sources of bioactive compounds found in the Amazonia region of Brazil. In this study, for the first time, the carotenoid and phenolic compound profiles of the pulp and peel of A. amazonicum fruits, from two varieties at two harvest periods, were determined by LC-MS. Additionally, the potential of the peel and pulp extracts to scavenge physiologically relevant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) was assessed. The major carotenoids in both parts of the fruits were lutein, accounting for 42% of the identified carotenoids in the peel and 25% in the pulp, whereas catechin and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives were the major phenolics in both parts. The peel extract, which presented the highest bioactive compound contents, was more efficient to scavenge ROS than the pulp. The peel extract showed high scavenging efficiency (IC50) for singlet oxygen (1O2; 16 g/ml), hypochlorous acid (HOCl; 20 g/ml), peroxynitrite (ONOO-; 38 g/ml), and superoxide radical (O2-; 47 g/ml), whereas the pulp extract exhibited high efficiency for ONOO- (13 g/ml), followed by HOCl (30 g/ml), 1O2 (76 g/ml), and less efficient for O2- (44 g/ml). Therefore, A. amazonicum fruits can be seen as an expressive source of bioactive compounds with high antioxidant potential to be further investigated to inhibit or delay oxidative processes both in food and physiological systems triggered by ROS and RNS. Practical Application. Bioactive compound extracts of Antrocaryon amazonicum fruits have high potential to be exploited for inhibiting or delaying oxidative processes and increase food stability. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

Characterization and classification of cocoa bean shells from different regions of venezuela using HPLC-PDA-MS/MS and spectrophotometric techniques coupled to chemometric analysis.		Foods					The cocoa bean shell (CBS) is one of the main cocoa byproducts with a prospective to be used as a functional food ingredient due to its nutritional and sensory properties. This study aims to define the chemical fingerprint of CBSs obtained from cocoa beans of diverse cultivars and collected in different geographical areas of Venezuela assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to photodiodes array and mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA-MS/MS) and spectrophotometric assays combined with multivariate analysis for classification purposes. The study provides a comprehensive fingerprint and quantitative data for 39 compounds, including methylxanthines and several polyphenols, such as flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, and N-phenylpropenoyl amino acids. Several key cocoa markers, such as theobromine, epicatechin, quercetin-3-O-glucoside, procyanidin_A pentoside_3, and N-coumaroyl-l-aspartate_2, were found suitable for the classification of CBS according to their cultivar and origin. Despite the screening methods required a previous purification of the sample, both methodologies appear to be suitable for the classification of CBS with a high correlation between datasets. Finally, preliminary findings on the identification of potential contributors for the radical scavenging activity of CBS were also accomplished to support the valorization of this byproduct as a bioactive ingredient in the production of functional foods. © 2021 by the authors.

Endogenous protein and peptide analysis with LC-MS/(MS): a feasibility study for authentication of raw-milk farmer's cheese.		International Dairy Journal					When consumers buy Dutch "Boerenkaas" (farmer's cheese), a cheese made from raw milk protected under the European traditional specialties guaranteed (TSG) label, they expect this product to be authentic. Because of the difference in production costs and risks, it is tempting to sell cheeses made from heat-treated milk as "Boerenkaas". It is therefore essential that there are methods that can verify the heat-treatment status of the milk in cheese. Here, for the first time a proof of principle method for analysis of endogenous cheese proteins/peptides with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in combination with multivariate analysis to detect discriminatory protein/peptide biomarkers between "Boerenkaas" and heat-treated milk cheese is described. A top-down MS method was developed for biomarker identification. The identified biomarkers were confirmed with the well-established bottom-up approach. Overall, there was good agreement between the outcome of the developed methods based on the known thermal treatment of the used sample set. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Barbut, S.; Tiensa, B. E.; Marangoni, A. G.							Partial fat replacement in liver pate using canola oil organogel.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Partial and full replacement of pork fat with canola oil organogels was done to improve nutritional and sensory properties of liver pate. Sensory analysis revealed that 100% replacement could not be differentiated from the control in terms of hardness, oiliness, cohesiveness, and off-flavours. Oil loss results revealed good retention for pates made with up to 60% organogels. Microscopy showed a gradual increase in fat globule size as more pork fat was replaced, and that could be one of the reasons for higher oil losses. Back extrusion (also a measure of spreadability), showed that organogel replacement (0-100%) provided similar values to the control pate. Colour evaluation showed that using canola oil organogels lowered the L* value and increased a* and b* values compared to the control pate. Overall, 60% pork fat replacement is recommended, based on oil retention and maintaining the textural properties with no effect on sensory properties and colour but with almost 40% reduction in saturated fat.

Food Chemistry					Raphanus sativus var. Longipinnatus, was exposed under experimental conditions to herbicides: rimsulfuron (RIM), administrated as (1) pure substance, (2) in commercially available formulation (RIMEL), (3) its degradation product: 4,6-dimethoxypyrimidin-2-amine (2ADP), (4) mesotrione (MES), (5) sulcotrione (SUL). Profiling and fingerprinting strategies, conducted by LC-MS/MS-FL, were employed to find markers of plant exposure to herbicide stress. The presence of RIM metabolite in the tissues of plant exposed to this herbicide proved that it is necessary to determine both parent compound and its by-products to obtain reliable information on plant exposure to agrochemicals. A higher content of normetanephrine (NMN) (18-175%) and lower content of tyramine (TYR) (49-75%) and epinephrine (E) (75-83%) was observed in plant tissues exposed to RIM and 2ADP in comparison to blank sample. Therefore, NMN, TRY and E may be considered as markers of plant response to RIM. Non-target analysis enables to recognize the type of herbicide used during cultivation.

Metal concentrations in Lactarius mushroom species collected from Southern Spain and Northern Morocco: evaluation of health risks and benefits.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this work, the concentration of five non-essential (Cr, As, Cd, Pb and Hg) and three essential elements (Cu, Zn and Se) in five different species from the genus Lactarius collected from Southern Spain and Northern Morocco were determined by ICP-MS after a block acid digestion. Zn was found to be the major element in all the studied samples, followed by Cu and Cr in almost all the cases. The data obtained from the Health Risk Index (HRI) assessment suggested that As content in L. semisanguifluus and L. deliciosus collected from different locations in Granada and Cadiz provinces (Spain) may pose a risk to human health. The comparison between the Daily Intake of Metals (DIM) and the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) indicated that the consumption of the studied mushrooms only covers a small percentage of the daily requirements of Cu, Zn and Se.

Food Control					Arsenic (As) is one of the toxic, persistent, and lethal heavy metalloids and requires rapid, less costly, and sensitive detection methods. This study proposed a label-free cuprous oxide/silver (Cu2O/Ag) surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) nanoprobe to detect total As in tea. Different total As spiked tea concentrations were mixed with the Cu2O/Ag SERS nanoprobe for the SERS detection. Quantitative models were established for predicting the total As in tea by comparatively applying chemometric algorithms. Amongst the algorithms, competitive adaptive reweighted sampling partial least squares (CARS-PLS) optimized the most effective spectral variables to predict the total As in tea efficiently. The CARS-PLS gave the highest correlation coefficient value (Rp=0.9935), very low root means square error (RMSEP=0.0496 mug g-1) in the prediction set and recorded the highest RPD value of 8.819. The proposed nanoprobe achieved a lower detection limit (0.00561 mug g-1), excellent selectivity, satisfactory reproducibility, and stability. No significant difference was recorded when the performance of the Cu2O/Ag total As SERS sensor was compared with the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method. Therefore, this developed Cu2O/Ag coupled chemometrics SERS sensing method could be used to efficiently determine, quantify, and predict total As in tea to promote monitoring of heavy metal contaminants.

J		Baris Karsli							Comparative analysis of the fatty acid composition of commercially available fish oil supplements in Turkey: public health risks and benefits.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Fish oil supplements have gained popularity in recent years due to their many health benefits, leading to a rapid increase in the number of fish oil supplements available to consumers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, the fatty acid composition (FA) of 15 commercial fish oil supplements including syrups (SYR) and capsules (CAP) from the Turkish marketplace was analyzed and some quality indices were evaluated. In addition, EPA and DHA content of FA was compared with their label claims. Fish oil supplements were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to determine their fatty acid composition and content. In fish oil supplements, the content of EPA ranged from 3.51% to 20.51%, and the contents of DHA ranged from 3.28%-52.42%. The label claims for EPA presented a reasonable accuracy for products examined, but it was observed that the DHA levels of some supplements showed a considerable difference with the labels. EPA and DHA levels of fish oil capsules on the Turkish retail market were more consistent with their claimed label content compared to fish oil syrups. The n3/n6 and PUFA/SFA ratios in the supplements were greater than those recommended by the FAO/WHO. The atherogenicity index (AI) and thrombogenicity index (TI) were below the maximum recommended limit value (1) in terms of coronary heart disease risk. Moreover, most of the supplements had higher lipid quality indices, including fish lipid quality (FLQ), hypocholesterolemic/Hypercholesterolemic (h/H) ratio, health-promoting index (HPI), polyene index (PI), and unsaturation index (UI).

E-beam irradiation of strawberries: investigation of microbiological, physicochemical, sensory acceptance properties and bioactive content.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					The effect of electron beam irradiation (1-3 kGy) was studied on the microbiological, physicochemical, sensory, and bioactive properties of strawberries during storage at 4 °C for 14 days. E-beam treatment reduced the population of fungi to non-detectable levels and the bacterial mesophilic population by 2 log CFU g-1. Sensory analysis highlighted the strawberries treated at 2 kGy with 7 days storage as the most appreciated. Principal Compounds Analysis between the different physicochemical parameters and sensory descriptors suggested that the attributes of the strawberries irradiated at 1 and 2 kGy were enhanced comparatively to the control. The bioactive content of strawberries was preserved or improved after irradiation and 7 days of storage. The results indicated that e-beam treatment at 2 kGy and refrigerated storage could guarantee the microbial safety and extend the shelf-life up to 7 days, while preserve and/or improve the physicochemical and sensory attributes of strawberries. Industrial relevance Strawberries are sources of compounds with high bioactivity and health benefits, despite of being high perishable. The present work demonstrated that e-beam radiation could be used as an environmental friendly and safe post-harvest treatment of strawberries to preserve the bioactive properties in order to extend their shelf-life, thus ensuring their quality and safety, and consequently, increasing their commercial value.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					The aim of this work was to perform a comprehensive study on the effect of gamma radiation on strawberries by evaluating its effect on physicochemical, microbiological, sensory acceptance, phenolic and flavonoid contents, and antioxidant activity over a storage period of 14 days at 4°C. The results showed that gamma irradiation significantly decreased the proliferation of molds and yeasts at 1, 2 and 3 kGy up to seven days of storage. However, a significant decrease of firmness, redness and chroma was noticed with gamma radiation doses. Moreover, sensory scores revealed that gamma radiation had no significant effect on strawberries compared to the non-treated, the dose of 2 kGy seemed to be the best dose to maintain the acceptance sensory quality of strawberries for the panel. A positive relation between different physicochemical parameters and sensory descriptors was illustrated with Principal Compounds Analysis. The gamma radiation treatment and refrigerated storage indicated to have an increasing trend on the bioactive content of strawberries. Based on the obtained results, the dose of 2 kGy point out to be the optimal treatment to maintain the safety and global quality of strawberries with extended shelf-life.

J		Barker, S.; Moss, R.; McSweeney, M. B.							Carbonated emotions: consumers' sensory perception and emotional response to carbonated and still fruit juices.		Food Research International					The global carbonated beverage market is large, and consumers like the oral irritation (ex. Burning or prickling) associated with carbonated beverages. This study's first objective was to identify the effect of carbonation on consumers' liking and sensory perception of fruit juices (apple, cherry, and blueberry). The secondary aim was to evaluate consumers' emotional responses to carbonated fruit juices. The first trial asked consumers (n = 103) to use check-all-that-apply (CATA) and nine-point hedonic scales to evaluate six fruit juices (three carbonated and three non-carbonated). In the second trial, consumers (n = 107) were asked to evaluate the pictures of the same juices using the CATA variant of EsSense25 Profile and a purchase intent scale. The consumers were also asked to identify what they like and dislike about carbonated beverages using an open-ended comment question. The first trial demonstrated that flavour significantly affected the overall liking scores but also identified that carbonation increased the overall liking of the blueberry and apple juices (p < 0.05). In the emotional response trial, the participants did not separate the samples based on carbonation, but rather separated the blueberry juices from the cherry and apple juices. The penalty lift analysis identified that when positive emotions were selected, the participants' purchase intent increased. Lastly, the consumers identified they like mouthfeel and flavour-enhancing qualities of carbonated beverages and associated them with special events. However, the participants disliked beverages that are too carbonated or flat and associated carbonated beverages with negative physical sensations and health perceptions. Overall, the flavour was more important than if the beverage was carbonated or not and purchase intent scores increased when positive emotions were perceived. Future research should investigate how emotions affect purchase intent, how participant's familiarity affects the emotions they select and evaluate how carbonation affects other beverages.

Contamination of fresh produce sold on the Italian market with Cyclospora cayetanensis and Echinococcus multilocularis.		Food Microbiology					To investigate the presence of Cyclospora cayetanensis, Toxoplasma gondii and Echinococcus spp. in fresh produce sold in Italy, 324 locally produced "ready-to-eat" (RTE) mixed-salad packages belonging to three brands and 324 berries packages (blueberries and blackberries imported from Peru and Mexico, respectively, and raspberries grown in Italy) were purchased at retail. Nine individual packages from each of the six types of fresh produce were collected monthly for one year, and with the same produce pooled, this resulted in a total of 72 pools for the whole year. Using microscopy (FLOTAC), a Cyclospora-like oocyst was detected in a blueberry sample and a taeniid egg was detected in a RTE-salad sample. Molecular tools confirmed these to be C. cayetanensis and Echinococcus multilocularis, respectively. Toxoplasma gondii was not detected in any of the samples. This study shows for the first time in Europe that imported berries on the Italian market may be contaminated with C. cayetanensis and RTE salads grown in Italy with E. multilocularis. The results indicate a new epidemiological scenario and highlight that current management of fresh produce, locally produced or imported, does not ensure products are free from parasite contamination.

J		Barnet, L. S.; Pozebon, D.; Dressler, V. L.; Cioato, D.							Method validation for As speciation in rice using LC-ICP-MS and the inorganic arsenic limit for Brazilian rice.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A methodology for As speciation in rice using liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS) was optimised and validated. Chromatographic separation and elution of As (III), DMA (V) (dimethylarsenic acid), MMA (V) (monomethylarsenic acid) and As (V) were achieved in less than 8 min using 10 mmol L-1 (NH4)2HPO4As the mobile phase, at pH 6 and a flow rate of 1.4 mL min-1. The limits of detection for As (III), DMA (V), MMA (V) and As (V) in rice were 1.87, 2.89, 0.54 and 3.00 ng g-1, respectively. The method's accuracy was assessed through analyte recovery tests and analysis of certified reference materials, which included white and brown rice flours. The validated method was applied for As speciation in 640 rice samples, comprising polished (white) rice, parboiled rice and brown rice collected from different mesoregions in the Rio Grande do Sul State in Brazil. By comparing the total concentration of As (tAs) found in the acid digested samples with the As species sum, the average extraction efficiencies were 9813%, 9312% and 866%, for white, parboiled, and brown rice, respectively. The average concentrations of inorganic arsenic (iAs, that is As (III)+ As (V)), DMA and tAs in brown and parboiled rice were not different but differed from those in white rice; the average concentrations of tAs, iAs and DMA in brown and parboiled rice were higher than those found in white rice were. The iAs concentration in all rice samples was lower than 200 ng g-1, which could be recommended as the maximum iAs concentration for Brazilian rice.

Green tea extract increases soluble RAGE and improves renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy.		Journal of Medicinal Food					One of the proposed mechanisms for the development of diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the increase of end products of advanced glycosylation (AGEs), which bind to its receptor (RAGE), favoring nephron cellular damage. An isoform of this receptor is soluble RAGE (sRAGE), which can antagonize AGE-altered intracellular signaling. It has known that green tea extract (GTE) increases the expression of sRAGE, but it is unknown whether this could improve kidney function. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the administration of GTE on the concentrations of sRAGE, renal function, and metabolic profile in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and DN. A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trial was carried out in 39 patients who received GTE (400 mg every 12h) or placebo for 3 months. SRAGE levels, renal function, and metabolic parameters were determined before and after the intervention. In the GTE group, there were statistically significant increase on sRAGE (320.55 157.63 pg/mL vs. 357.59 144.99 pg/mL; P = .04) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR; 66.44 15.17 mL/min/1.73 m2 vs. 71.70 19.33 mL/min/1.73 m2; P = .04), and a statistically significant decrease in fasting serum glucose (7.62 3.00 mmol/L vs. 5.86 1.36 mmol/L; P ≤ .01) and triacylglycerols (1.91 0.76 mmol/L vs. 1.58 0.69; P = .02). Administration of GTE increases the serum concentration of sRAGE and the GFR and decreases the concentration of fasting serum glucose and triacylglycerols. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT03622762.

Influence of ultimate pH on biochemistry and quality of Longissimus lumborum steaks from Nellore bulls during ageing.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Ultimate pH (pHu) is an indicator that influences post-mortem meat quality. We studied physiological and biochemical changes of steaks obtained from Nellore bulls (Bos indicus) during post-mortem ageing. To this, Longissimus lumborum (LL) muscles were classified into three groups: Normal-pHu (≤5.79), Intermediate-pHu (5.80-6.29) and High-pHu (≥6.30) groups, portioned into steaks, vacuum packaged and matured at 2 °C for 0,7, 14,21 and 28 days. High-pHu steaks exhibited impaired colour stability and were darker compared to the other groups. High-and Normal-pHu steaks showed improved tenderness and myofibrillar fragmentation linked to proteolysis. Intermediate-pHu steaks were associated with a lower meat tenderness and decreased collagen solubility. High-pHu steaks retained a high pH during ageing and increased water-holding capacity. These findings provide evidence that highlight pHu as a strategy for the classification of pHu-dependent beef quality from Nellore bulls that can be adopted by the Brazilian meat industry. © 2021 Institute of Food, Science and Technology (IFSTTF).										2021	56	7	3333	3343	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14955					FSTA:2021-10-Sg6164

Food Research International					Healthier meat products have a major economic potential and are attracting considerable research and media attention to meet the growing and complex consumer demand. Whether this potential will be realized and at what speed is contingent on consumers' acceptance of these novel foods. This study uses a cross-cultural context to co-create new healthier meat products, while mapping the conditions leading to consumers' product acceptance (vs. rejection). Results from online focus groups conducted in Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom show that consumers generally have a negative attitude toward healthier meat products due to unfamiliarity and perception of over-processing. Nevertheless, partial meat-substitution with plant-based ingredients together with fat and salt reduction show specific conditions under which consumers' acceptance would be possible. This is further related to product-specific factors: ingredients and base meat, and marketing-related factors: labelling and packaging. Finally, implications and recommendations for the manufacturing and marketing of new healthier meat products are provided. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

International Dairy Journal					The impact of calcium fortification, delivered using different proportions of soluble (calcium chloride; CaCl2) and insoluble (micronised calcium citrate; CaCit) calcium salts, on physicochemical and thermal stability properties of a model infant milk formula (IMF) was determined. The IMF was formulated with a whey protein fraction dominant in alpha-lactalbumin and fortified with calcium (1500 mgL-1) using 70:30, 60:40, 50:50, 40:60 and 30:70 ratios of CaCit: CaCl2. Increasing CaCl2 levels decreased the net zeta-potential of IMFs from -41.0 to -22.1 mV and increased ionic calcium levels (1.44-6.99 mm). The apparent viscosity, especially at acidic pH (6.40), increased compared to the control with values ranging from 22.3 to 50.2 mPa s for ratios 70:30 and 30:70, respectively. In addition, mean particle size of the IMF increased, with values ranging from 2.19 to 43.4 mum. This study provides useful information in supporting next-generation fortification strategies of nutritional dairy-based products with calcium. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Polychlorinated dioxins, furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) in food from Italy: estimates of dietary intake and assessment.		Journal of Food Science					Dietary intake of polychlorinated dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (dl-PCBs) from various foods (fish and seafood, meat and meat-based products, milk and dairy products, hen eggs, olive oil and fats) was investigated for various sex/age groups of the Italian population. The concentrations of PCDD/Fs and dl-PCBs and their contribution to total TEQ values varied depending on food matrix. Fish (0.50 pg WHO-TEQ/g wet weight) and seafood (0.16 pg WHO-TEQ/g wet weight) showed the highest mean concentrations of PCDD/Fs plus dl-PCBs, followed by meat (1.70 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight), meat based products (1.03 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight), milk and dairy products (0.78 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight), hen eggs (0.71 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight), fats (0.27 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight) and olive oil (0.09 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight). In all samples WHO-TEQ PCDD/F plus dl-PCB concentrations fulfilled the European Union food law, except in pork loin samples (1.39 pg WHO-TEQ/g lipid weight). Differences in exposure depending on the sex/age groups (children > teenagers > adults > elders) and hypotheses considered (lower bound and upper bound) were encountered. Non-cancer risk values showed a low exposure. Carcinogenicity risk results revealed that highly exposed individuals were distributed over all sex/age groups, even though the proportion of individuals exceeding the safe limit was higher in children. These data once again underline the importance of trying to control the levels of these contaminants in fishery products, particularly in fish, who represents one of the main exposure sources for consumers.

JNK pathway and heat shock response mediate the survival of C26 colon carcinoma bearing mice fed with the mushroom Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii without affecting tumor growth or cachexia.		Food & Function					In the last few years, there has been emerging interest in developing treatments against human diseases using natural bioactive content. Here, the powder of the edible mushroom Pleurotus eryngii var. eryngii was mixed with the normal diet of mice bearing C26 colon carcinoma. Interestingly, it was evidenced by a significant increase in the survival rate of C26 tumor-bearing mice accompanied by a significant increase in Hsp90 and Hsp27 protein levels in the tumors. These data were paralleled by a decrease in Hsp60 levels. The mushroom introduced in the diet induced the inhibition of the transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-1 exerting an anti-inflammatory action. The effects of the mushroom were mediated by the activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases as a result of metabolic stress induced by the micronutrients introduced in the diet. In the tumors of C26 bearing mice fed with Pleurotus eryngii there was also a decreased expression of the mitotic regulator survivin and the anti-apoptotic factor Bcl-xL as well as an increase in the expression levels of Atg7, a protein that drives autophagy. In our hypothesis the interplay of these molecules favored the survival of the mice fed with the mushroom. These data are promising for the introduction of Pleurotus eryngii as a dietary supplement or as an adjuvant in anti-cancer therapy. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Food Bioscience					Cardoon flower extract is a vegetable coagulant used in the manufacture of some highly appreciated Mediterranean Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) sheep cheeses, due to their typical flavor and smooth texture. Flowers from 6 cardoon plants (1M-6M), selected on the basis of the total and specific A0, A and B cardosin concentrations were characterized using chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis. Extracts of these flowers were used to investigate the relationship between the biochemical profile and the proteolytic activity on caseins, coagulation properties and cheese texture. Milk-clotting activity and coagulation were measured using an Optigraph. Cheese making trials were done using the traditional protocol of Serra da Estrela PDO cheese manufacture. A multivariate exploratory PCA analysis showed that plants 4M, 5M and 6M with the highest total concentration of cardosins, the prevalence of cardosin A, proteolytic action with kappa-casein, and the lowest time of coagulation yielded cheeses with a firmer paste. Plants 1M, 2M and 3M, without the presence of cardosin A, were negatively influenced by the proteolytic action with beta-casein, starting flocculation and gel consistency. Plant 3M showed a slow micellar aggregation rate and low gel firmness during milk coagulation, which was reflected in the smooth texture of the cheese. The specific characterization of natural biochemical diversity of cardoon flowers and their influence on cheese texture may help producers to choose the appropriated cardoon flowers to obtain a desired texture.

Authentication of barley-finished beef using visible and near infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) and different discrimination approaches.		Meat Science					This study evaluated visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (Vis-NIRS) to authenticate barley-finished beef using different discrimination approaches. Dietary grain source (barley, corn, or blend-50% barley/50% corn) did not affect (P>0.05) meat quality but influenced (P<0.05) fatty acid profiles. The longissimus thoracis (LT) from barley-fed steers had lower n-6 fatty acid content and n-6/n-3 ratio compared to LT from corn and blended grain-fed steers. Vis-NIRS coupled with partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and support vector machine in the linear (L-SVM) kernel classified with approximately 70% overall accuracy subcutaneous fat and intact LT samples, respectively, from barley, corn, and blended-fed cattle. When only barley and corn samples were considered, fat and intact LT samples were correctly classified with overall accuracy >94% with PLS-DA and radial/L-SVM, and approximately 90% with PLS-DA and L-SVM, respectively. Ground LT samples were classified with ≤70% overall accuracy. Vis-NIRS measurements on fat and intact LT have potential to discriminate between corn and barley-fed beef.

Effect of feeding barley, corn, and a barley/corn blend on beef composition and end-product palatability.		Foods					This study evaluated the relationship among palatability attributes, volatile compounds, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in meat from barley, corn, and blended (50:50, barley and corn) grain-fed steers. Multiple correspondence analysis with three dimensions (Dim) explained 62.2% of the total variability among samples. The Dim 1 and 2 (53.3%) separated pure from blended grain-fed beef samples. Blended grain beef was linked to a number of volatiles including (E,E)-2,4-decadienal, hexanal, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione. In addition, blended grain-fed beef was linked to fat-like and rancid flavors, stale-cardboard, metallic, cruciferous, and fat-like aroma descriptors, and negative categories for flavor intensity (FI), off-flavor, and tenderness. A possible combination of linoleic and linolenic acids in the blended diet, lower rumen pH, and incomplete biohydrogenation of blended grain-fed polyunsaturates could have increased (p≤0.05) long-chain n-6 fatty acids (LCFA) in blended grain-fed beef, leading to more accumulation of FA oxidation products in the blended than in barley and corn grain-fed meat samples. The Dim 3 (8.9%) allowed corn separation from barley grain beef. Barley grain-fed beef was mainly linked to alkanes and beef positive FI, whereas corn grain-fed beef was associated with pyrazines, in addition to aldehydes related to n-6 LCFA oxidation. © 2021 by the authors.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Estimated intake of six low and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS) (acesulfame potassium, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, steviol glycosides and sucralose) from processed foods and beverages, as well as from tabletop sweeteners uses, by the Brazilian population were derived and compared to the respective Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). The estimates were based on dietary consumption data from a nationwide cross-sectional survey conducted by the Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatistica (IBGE) in 2008-2009 and LNCS use rates and associated market share information based on data provided by Brazilian industry members. Two intake scenarios were considered: a conservative brand loyal consumer scenario that assumes all LNCS-containing foods and beverages and tabletop sweeteners contain the maximum reported LNCS concentrations (Scenario A) and a scenario representative of the general consumer population that uses a market share weighted average of the reported concentrations (Scenario B). Intake estimates were derived for the total Brazilian population (age 10+ y), and for the subpopulations of adolescents (10-18y), adults (19-59y), and older adults (60+ y). Intake of LNCS up to the 95th percentile did not exceed their respective ADI for all subpopulations considered, in either the general consumer scenario or the brand loyal scenario. Among consumers age 10+ y, the 95th percentile intakes of the various LNCS ranged from 6.8% to 54% of their respective ADI for the brand loyal scenario and from <1% to 6.0% of their respective ADIs for the general consumer scenario. © 2020 Exponent Inc.

J		Barraj, L.; Xiaoyu Bi; Nga Tran							Screening level intake estimates of low and no-calorie sweeteners in Argentina, Chile, and Peru.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					As obesity rates increase, several countries in Latin America have implemented strategies to curb the consumption of sugars, resulting in reformulations of products with low and no-calorie sweeteners (LNCS). The increased availability of LNCS-containing products raises concerns about the potential risk of exceeding the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI). Information on the intake of LNCS among Latin American countries are limited by the lack of publicly available national consumption data. Using the Budget Method, screening level intake estimates of six LNCS (acesulfame potassium, aspartame, cyclamate, saccharin, steviol glycosides, and sucralose) were derived for Argentina, Chile, and Peru based on national sales data and product labels. Four tiered assessments were conducted where assumption of LNCS use ranged from the most conservative Tier 1 to the more refined yet conservative LNCS use and concentrations in subsequent tiers. The estimated intakes, applicable to the total population as well as children, were below their ADIs for all tiers. For Tier 2 where average LNCS concentrations were assumed present in all LNCS-containing products, intakes were <60% of the ADI. Estimates for the more refined tiers were comparable to published estimates based on select subpopulations in these countries, validating the approach used in this study. © 2021 Exponent Inc.

Foods					The search for waste minimization and the valorization of by-products are key practices for good management and improved sustainability in the food industry. The production of almonds generates a large amount of waste, most of which is not used. Until now, almonds have been used for their high nutritional value as food, especially almond meat. The other remaining parts (skin, shell, hulls, etc.) are still little explored, even though they have been used as fuel by burning or as livestock feed. However, interest in these by-products has been increasing as they possess beneficial properties (caused mainly by polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) and can be used as new ingredients for the food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, it is important to explore almond's valorization of by-products for the development of new added-value products that would contribute to the reduction of environmental impact and an improvement in the sustainability and competitiveness of the almond industry. © 2021 by the authors.

A proteomic- and bioinformatic-based identification of specific allergens from edible insects: probes for future detection as food ingredients.		Foods					The increasing development of edible insect flours as alternative sources of proteins added to food and feed products for improving their nutritional value, necessitates an accurate evaluation of their possible adverse side-effects, especially for individuals suffering from food allergies. Using a proteomic- and bioinformatic-based approach, the diversity of proteins occurring in currently consumed edible insects such as silkworm (Bombyx mori), cricket (Acheta domesticus), African migratory locust (Locusta migratoria), yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor), red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus), and giant milworm beetle (Zophobas atratus), was investigated. Most of them consist of phylogenetically-related protein allergens widely distributed in the different groups of arthropods (mites, insects, crustaceans) and mollusks. However, a few proteins belonging to discrete protein families including the chemosensory protein, hexamerin, and the odorant-binding protein, emerged as proteins highly specific for edible insects. To a lesser extent, other proteins such as apolipophorin III, the larval cuticle protein, and the receptor for activated protein kinase, also exhibited a rather good specificity for edible insects. These proteins, that are apparently missing or much less represented in other groups of arthropods, mollusks and nematods, share well conserved amino acid sequences and very similar three-dimensional structures. Owing to their ability to trigger allergic responses in sensitized people, they should be used as probes for the specific detection of insect proteins as food ingredients in various food products and thus, to assess their food safety, especially for people allergic to edible insects. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Barrera, E. L.; Hertel, T.							Global food waste across the income spectrum: implications for food prices, production and resource use.		Food Policy					There are few examples in the existing literature that address the quantitative linkages between food waste, food security, and environmental sustainability, at global scale. Here we develop a new panel database on household food waste at the national level based on the Energy Balance equation, including adjustments for changes in body weight over time. We use this to characterize the non-linear relationship between per capita income and the share of food availability wasted. By incorporating this relationship into a global partial equilibrium model of the agricultural sector (SIMPLE), we develop future trajectories of household food waste. We find that the emerging economies, particularly China and South Asia, are likely to play a key role in determining global food waste at mid-century. We also present several counterfactual scenarios that shed light on the implications for environmental and food security of limiting future growth in food waste. We find that the global impacts of these alternative pathways are greatly enhanced in the context of a more open international trade regime.

Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this work an HPLC-DAD determination method for free and total HMF in "dulce de leche" was developed and validated. The separation was carried out using a mobile phase of acetonitrile-water (4.5:95.5, v/v) on Acclaim120 C18 (4.6*150 mm, 5 mum), at 30 °C and a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The detection was done at 284 nm. The method showed good selectivity and linearity (determination coefficient over 0.999). Low LOD and LOQ values were obtained (19.51 mug/L and 65.05 mug/L respectively). Relative standard deviation (RSD) for repeatability and intermediate precision was <4.12% and <5.98% respectively. Recovery rates were between 89.04% and 91.89%. In addition, the HMF contents in commercial "dulce de leche" from Chile was reported, ranging from 2.33 to 10.31 mg/kg for free HMF and 314.61-464.98 mg/kg for total HMF.

Senescent sweetening in potato (Solanum tuberosum) tubers is associated with a reduction in plastidial glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator transcripts.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Senescent sweetening results in the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers following extended periods of storage at moderate temperatures used to avoid the separate condition of cold-induced sweetening. It represents a significant problem for the potato processing industry due to the development of dark fry colour and the accumulation of acrylamide in processed products. Previous studies have implicated oxidative stress in the accumulation of reducing sugars in potato tubers over long term storage. However, in the present analysis we found no evidence for a correlation between oxidative stress as estimated from quantification of hydrogen peroxide, lipid peroxidation or activity of redox enzymes and the accumulation of reducing sugars. On the contrary, transcriptional profiling indicated changes in carbohydrate metabolism were associated with the onset of senescent sweetening and qRT-PCR indicated that reduced abundance of transcripts encoding a plastidial glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator was widely observed during sweetening onset in multiple genotypes. Our data suggest that reduction in the capacity of plastids to import glucose-6-phosphate reduces the capacity for starch resynthesis in the stored tuber thereby shifting the metabolic balance towards starch turnover resulting in reducing sugar accumulation.

Food Chemistry					Melamine is a compound commonly used in the manufacturing of plastic and flame retardant products, but due to its solubility on water and high nitrogen content, it is also used to adulterate milk to mask adulteration by dilution in protein content tests. This work proposes a quick method using excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and second-order calibration methods (PARAFAC and U-PLS/RBL) for the identification and quantification of melamine in milk. The proposed method uses a single clean-up step with acetic acid, resulting in a quick, low-cost, and environmentally friendly procedure, in agreement with green chemistry principles. Both PARAFAC and U-PLS/RBL were capable of detecting melamine in milk above 120.6 and 146.5 ppm respectively, adequate for adulterations above 2% in volume, with RMSEPs of 68.6 and 81.9 ppm, respectively.

Organic black beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) from Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, present more phenolic compounds and better nutritional profile than nonorganic.		Foods					Brazil is the world's third largest common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) producer, and 60% of its population consumes this legume. Although organic farming is a sustainable alternative to nonorganic agriculture, its effect on chemical composition is still controversial. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate differences in the nutritional and phenolic compounds profiles between organically and nonorganically produced Brazilian black beans. Samples were obtained from the same harvest periods and from near geographical locations at metropolitan and coastal regions of Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil. No residues of 294 evaluated pesticides were detected in the samples. In both regions, organic beans had 17% fewer lipids, 10% less phytate and 20% more proteins when compared to nonorganic ones. Sixteen different phenolic compounds were identified as soluble and insoluble forms in black beans, with anthocyanins being the most abundant (on average, 66%). In both regions, soluble and total phenolic compounds contents in organic beans were consistently higher (on average, 25% and 28%, respectively) than in nonorganic ones. Our results show that organic farming improves the nutritional profile and increases the phenolic compounds content of black beans. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Barrett, A.; Ahnrud, G.; Ziegler, D.; Xun Liu; Kaletunc, G.							Ultrasonic agglomeration of model flour systems: process parameter-product physico-thermal property relationships.		Journal of Food Science					Ultrasonic compression was applied to wheat flour to create an agglomerated and compacted model food system. This novel process combines physical compression with ultrasonic vibration to permanently weld particles together, thereby producing a robust compact. Fundamental relationships among operating parameters, energy imparted to the specimens, and physical properties of the agglomerated products were developed. Integrated agglomeration energy was determined to be a linear function of percent maximum horn amplitude and ultrasonication time, and integrated energy in turn influenced product physical properties, such as density and fracture strength, in highly significant linear relationships. Microscopic, computer tomographic, and differential scanning calorimetric analyses confirmed progressive compaction of and thermal stability changes in the flour matrix with increased processing energy. Specimens agglomerated at higher energy levels were furthermore demonstrated to have higher fracture strength than conventionally (pressure-only) compressed specimens despite similar densities, due to the robust interparticle bridging produced by agglomeration. Practical Application. Ultrasonic agglomeration represents a potential improvement over standard compression in the manufacturing of meal-supplementing energy bars. Ultrasonic agglomeration effectively adheres particles together without incorporation of low-nutrient-density syrups and binders. Agglomerated and compacted products also have superior mechanical stability, which can improve texture and physical stability during product handling. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.

J		Barrett, T.; Yaohua Feng							Evaluation of food safety curriculum effectiveness: a longitudinal study of high-school-aged youths' knowledge retention, risk-perception, and perceived behavioral control.		Food Control					Societal changes have prompted the elimination of Family and Consumer Science courses from many schools and the reduction of food-handler role models at home. Declining opportunities for youth to acquire food-handling knowledge and skills increases their risk of contracting a foodborne illness. Many youths are employed in food service and could perpetuate the spread of foodborne illness. In this study, two food safety curricula were evaluated for effectiveness in changing the food safety knowledge, risk-perception, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) of high school students enrolled in microbiology and agriculture courses, immediately following and one year after an educational intervention. One curriculum utilized the Positive Deviance (PD) model, while the other utilized Experiential Learning (EL) methods. Survey questions related to risk-perception and PCB were measured on a five-point Likert scale. Twenty-four knowledge questions were assigned one point for each correct answer and zero points for incorrect answers. Risk-perception and PBC continued to increase from the post-survey to the follow-up survey among the PD and EL Groups. After the educational intervention, the EL Group perceived themselves to be at a greater risk for contracting a foodborne illness and became significantly more confident in their abilities to clean food-contact surfaces, store food safely, and prepare food that is safe to eat. Knowledge scores also significantly increased among the PD (16.88-18.78) and EL (16.66-18.81) Groups. After one year, only the EL Group scored significantly higher on the follow-up survey (18.87) than on the pre-survey (16.66). Microbiology students achieved the highest knowledge scores (20.47) after the educational intervention; however, their knowledge gain significantly attenuated (19.39) after one year. Students reported sharing food safety information with family to improve food-handling behaviors. This study demonstrates the need for continued food safety education to retain knowledge and highlights the study's curricula continued influence on students' risk-perception and PBC.

Production of vitex (Vitexagnus-castus L.) extract in powder form using spray-drying: potential for the production of functional foods.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Vitex (Vitex agnus-castus L.) have bioactive compounds with potential to reduce the symptoms of menopause and premenstrual syndrome, as proved by several studies. However, such compounds may have low stability, and the spicy sensation caused by vitex fruits is a challenge for application in foods. Thus, the aim of this study was to produce microparticles by spray-drying loaded with vitex extract, and evaluate the physical and chemical properties of the powders for further application in new functional foods. The powders presented good process yield (ca. 63.4%) and retention (ca. 77.7%), volume weighted mean diameter of approximately 20.3 m, and high stability of the bioactive compounds during the storage. Moreover, they showed good storage stability in different relative humidity, and they were classified as very low hygroscopic powders. Overall, these results are very promising and they may promote the production of a potential functional ingredient for new functional foods. Practical applications. Considering the good process yield, retention and stability of the bioactive compounds during the storage, and the powder produced and characterized in the present study represents a potential functional ingredient with good technological properties. Moreover, it may be an alternative to increase the consumers' ingestion of vitex bioactive compounds by application of the spray-dried powder in new functional foods such as chocolate and cereal bars. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Effect of formulation and heat treatment on 5-hydroxymethylfurfural formation and quality parameters in dulce de leche.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					This work assessed the effect of formulation and heat treatment on the formation of HMF, non-enzymatic browning and rheology of dulce de leche (DL). Laboratory scale trials were developed with different DL formulas: whole powdered milk, skimmed milk, and lactose-free skimmed milk, and added sucrose, subjected to different processing temperatures (110 °C, 120 °C, and 130 °C). Additionally, an alternative formulation was designed in which half the sucrose was replaced by 50% tagatose. DL samples were compared with three commercial products in terms of water activity, soluble solids content, pH, colour, apparent viscosity, and HMF concentration. HMF formation in DL was mitigated (35%) in a lactose-free formulation by lowering the process temperature. Moreover, HMF formation was reduced up to 80% replacing sucrose by tagatose without affecting the quality parameters (pH, soluble solids, colour, and apparent viscosity). Decrease in processing temperature and the use of tagatose are viable alternatives for HMF mitigation in DL. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					This study estimates for the first time dietary acrylamide intake in Chile and conducts exposure risk assessments using the margin of exposure (MOE) method. A consumption frequency survey of starchy foods was carried out in the metropolitan region of Santiago, Chile on people from different socioeconomic levels aged between 12 and 65 years old. The acrylamide contents of the most frequently consumed foods were determined by an in-house validated GC-MS technique. The potatoes and bread group contributed ~77% to the dietary acrylamide exposure in Chile, with estimated daily mean exposure of 0.55 g kgbw-1 day-1 and 0.22 g kgbw-1 day-1, respectively. Chilean population aged between 12 and 17 years old presented the highest acrylamide intake (mean, 1.27 g kgbw-1 day-1; 95th percentile, 3.90 g kgbw-1 day-1). Finally, since the estimated MOEs were lower than 10,000, the dietary acrylamide exposure in the metropolitan region of Santiago, Chile is of public health concern according to the EFSA criteria. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Infrared spectroscopy coupled with chemometrics in coffee post-harvest processes as complement to the sensory analysis.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Sensory evaluation provides subjective information about characteristics related to the crop management and post-harvesting of coffee. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) quickly and easily detects additional coffee characteristics to those obtained through sensory analysis. This work aimed to complement the sensory evaluation of Specialty coffee by using FTIR and chemometrics. Samples from all three post-harvest methods (dry, semi-dry, and wet) were sensory analysed using the protocol of the Specialty Coffee Association (SCA). Infrared spectra were obtained from samples of green beans, medium roast coffee, and dark roast coffee, previously processed by the three post-harvest methods. Sensory evaluation, according to the SCA quality criteria, classified the coffee obtained from semi-dry process as excellent specialty coffee, and coffees obtained by wet and dry processing methods as very good specialty coffees. PCAs discriminated the post-harvest treatments based on the FTIR data. Recognition based on prediction of samples of the post-harvest treatments by LDAs was over 95%. Results. Demonstrated that FTIR in combination with multivariate analysis complemented the information obtained from the sensory analysis, and allowed to discriminate and identify the post-harvest treatments for green beans, medium roast coffee, and dark roast coffee.

Physicochemical characterization and polyphenol oxidase inactivation of Ataulfo mango pulp pasteurized by conventional and ohmic heating processes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Ohmic heating (OH) is an emerging technology with potential for pasteurization and enzyme inactivation in mango pulp. This research aimed to investigate the effect of OH and conventional boiling treatment (CT) at moderate pasteurization conditions (72 °C, 2 min) on the physicochemical characteristics and the polyphenol oxidase (PPO) residual activity in Ataulfo mango pulp. Pulp's physical features, such as titratable acidity (TA) and pH did not show differences (p > 0.05) between treatments, whereas OH increased the apparent viscosity of mango pulp (10.26-15.64%). This effect was associated to a higher release of insoluble fiber. Both thermal treatments affected the color (DeltaE values > 5) of mango pulp. PPO inactivation reached 95.7 5.9% after 15 s with both thermal treatments. In silico molecular dynamics suggested that temperature and pH contributed to the PPO inactivation by inducing modifications in its catalytic site and altering the protein-substrate interaction. Our results indicate that OH is an effective technology to inactivate PPO at moderate pasteurization conditions (72 °C, 15 s), with minimal modifications on the physicochemical properties of Ataulfo mango pulp.

Paraprobiotic obtained by ohmic heating added in whey-grape juice drink is effective to control postprandial glycemia in healthy adults.		Food Research International					The effect of paraprobiotic Lacticaseibacillus casei 01 inactivated by ohmic heating (8 V/cm, 95 °C/7 min, 60 Hz) whey-grape juice drink at the postprandial glycemia was evaluated. In vitro hypoglycemic activity was assessed by the alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition, while in vivo activity was determined using 15 healthy subjects, which consumed bread + probiotic whey drink, bread + paraprobiotic whey drink, and bread alone as a control. The probiotic and paraprobiotic grape-flavored whey drinks showed similar alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibition (51.2 vs 51.8% and 43.2 vs 44.2%, respectively). The consumption of both paraprobiotic and probiotic whey drinks increased the incremental glucose rate when compared to the control due to the presence of sugar in its composition, without changes in the other parameters evaluated (maximum glucose value, glucose incremental percentage, and peak blood glucose time), showing a reduced glycemic response. In addition, the consumption of the paraprobiotic drink maintained the maximum glucose increase similar to the control, while an increase in this parameter was observed after the consumption of the probiotic drink. Therefore, the paraprobiotic grape-flavored whey drink may be an effective alternative to replace the probiotic product in reducing the postprandial glycemia in healthy individuals.

OH at different electric field magnitudes (4,8, and 12 V/cm at 60 Hz) and conventional heat treatment (CONV) were performed to determine the most adequate condition for the obtainment of paraprobiotics. Analysis of culturability, flow cytometry (FC), and Scanning electron microscope (SEM) was carried out. The complete inactivation by CONV was achieved only in the following conditions: LA-95 °C/5 min, LC and BA-95 °C/7 min. The same temperature profile was used in OH treatments to study the OH electrical effects. The OH treatment (8 V/cm) caused lower damage to the cell membrane integrity compared to the CONV treatment (p < 0.05). The OH showed to be adequate technology for the efficient production of paraprobiotics. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Application of chemometric tools in the development of food bars based on cocoa shell, soy flour and green banana flour.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					In this study, exploratory methods and the simplex-centroid design were applied in the development of food bars with cocoa shell, soy and green banana flours that were evaluated sensorially. The results of the chemical composition and texture were submitted to the Scott-Knott test and the Principal Component Analysis, and was observed a significant difference between the treatments (P< 0.05), as well as a tendency to form five groups, according to its nutritional characteristics. The design used to optimise the sensorial acceptance of the food bars was effective, whose contour surface indicated an optimal region with greater acceptance, with all formulations having good acceptance (scores above 5.52).

Edible seeds clustering based on phenolics and antioxidant activity using multivariate analysis.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Edible seeds, especially those known by the population as nuts, have their consumption associated with functional appeal. The present study aimed to compare and group nine different seeds, traditional and regional, according to their similarities, in terms of moisture, total phenolic compounds (TPC) and antioxidant activity, through multivariate analyses. All results were submitted to Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Clusters (HCA) and Kohonen's self-organizing maps (ANN/KSOM). The seeds differed in terms of moisture content, TPC and antioxidant activity. The walnut butterfly stood out with the highest levels of TPC and antioxidant activity. In the multivariate analyses application, three groups were formed: i) hazel, baru, Brazil, macadamia, almond and cashew; ii) pequi and marolo; iii) walnut butterfly. It is concluded that the seeds can be separated into three groups, with ANN/KSOMs being the most self-explanatory analysis and that regional seeds are nutritionally similar to those traditionally consumed.

Healthy beef burgers: effect of animal fat replacement by algal and wheat germ oil emulsions.		Meat Science					The present study aimed to reformulate beef burgers to make them healthier through total replacement of pork backfat by algal (Al) and/or wheat germ (WG) oils emulsions. The addition of oils emulsions increased the protein and decreased the proportions of lipids in the burgers between 26% and 38%. Colour and technological parameters were not affected by the addition of oils, but increased all TPA parameters. alpha-tocopherol (Vitamin E) increased in reformulated samples. The wheat germ oil reduced the SFA concentration. The use of algal and/or wheat germ oils emulsions increase PUFA concentration. Beef burgers containing algal oil can be claimed as "high omega-3 content". Both oils improved the n-6/n-3 and PUFA/SFA nutritional ratios. Sensory differences were observed in the flavour and overall quality parameters. The formulations containing algal oil emulsion were similar to the Control. As a general conclusion, the use of algal oil emulsion as pork backfat substitute improve nutritional characteristics of burger without affecting technological or sensory properties.

Volatile profiles of five jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) cultivars grown in the Mexican Pacific area.		Food Research International					The volatile compounds of five kind of cultivars of jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) grown in Nayarit, Mexico, was researched by using extraction and chromatographic methods such as headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Eighty-six volatile compounds were identified. The most prominent compounds in the analyzed cultivars were alkyl esters of 3-methylbutanoic acid. Ethyl 3-methylbutanoate was the most abundant ester in FMC, JMC and RMC cultivars (190.7-961.2 g/kg), whereas butyl 3-methylbutanoate (152.8-205.2 g/kg) and pentyl 3-methylbutanoate (105.1-210.9 g/kg) were predominant in DMC and BMC cultivars. By utilizing clustering statistical techniques such as principal component analysis was possible to identify certain esters compounds (number and concentration) to differentiate each cultivar.

Oilseed cake flour composition, functional properties and antioxidant potential as effects of sieving and species differences.		Foods					Oilseed cakes are produced as a by-product of oil pressing and are mostly used as feed. Their use for human consumption is due to the functional properties and benefits for human health. Herein, oilseed cake flours of eight species (flax, hemp, milk thistle, poppy, pumpkin, rapeseed, safflower, sunflower) were sieved into fractions above (A250) and below (B250) 250 m. The chemical composition, SDS-PAGE profiles, colour, functional properties and antioxidant activities of these flours were evaluated. The B250 fractions were evaluated as being protein and ash rich, reaching crude protein and ash content ranging from 31.78% (milk thistle) to 57.47% (pumpkin) and from 5.0% (flax) to 11.19% (poppy), respectively. A high content of carbohydrates was found in the flours of hemp, milk thistle and safflower with a significant increase for the A250 fraction, with a subsequent relation to a high water holding capacity (WHC) for the A250 fraction (flax, poppy, pumpkin and sunflower). The A250 milk thistle flour was found to have the richest in polyphenols content (TPC) (40.89 mg GAE/g), with the highest antioxidant activity using an ABTS.+ assay (101.95 mg AAE/g). The A250 fraction for all the species exhibited lower lightness than the B250 fraction. The obtained results indicate that sieving oilseed flour with the aim to prepare flours with specific functional characteristics and composition is efficient only in combination with a particular species. © 2021 by the authors.

Effect on benzoic acid production of yoghurt culture and the temperatures of storage and milk heat treatment in yoghurts from cow, goat and sheep milk.		Foods					Yoghurts from cow, goat and sheep milk were produced and stored under defined conditions to monitor the influence of various factors on the benzoic acid content as determined by Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC). The highest level of benzoic acid was found in sheep yoghurt (43.265.11 mg kg-1) and the lowest in cow yoghurt (13.383.56 mg kg-1), with goat yoghurt (21.315.66 mg kg-1) falling in between. Benzoic acid content did not show statistically significant variation until the second and third weeks of storage, and the dynamics of this variation varied depending on the type of yoghurt. The yoghurt culture containing different strains of Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and Streptococcus thermophilus also affected the contents of benzoic acid. Further, the different storage temperatures (2 and 8 °C) as well as the temperatures used to milk heat treatment before yoghurt production (80,85 and 90 °C) affected the amount of benzoic acid in different types of yoghurts. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Barth, R.; Rieger, R. H.; Kim, Y.							Ruggedized color measurement for beer, wort, and malt.		Journal of the American Society of Brewing Chemists					The standard instrument for measuring malt, wort, and beer color is the spectrophotometer. Spectrophotometers are not rugged; they have critically aligned collimators, monochromators, lenses, slits, and mirrors that make them difficult to use and maintain in a production environment. Our research shows that wort and beer color can be measured accurately with rugged equipment based on light emitting diodes (LEDs) with results in agreement with those of a spectrophotometer. Two or more colored diodes were used. LED-based apparatus does not require critical alignment, is not highly sensitive to environmental conditions such as temperature, moisture, dust, and vibration, and can be rapid, inexpensive, compact, rugged, and easy to use. Statistical comparison in the range of 1-9 °SRM shows an insignificant bias for (SRM-LED) of-0.060.4 °SRM. The intraclass correlation coefficient for the differences was 0.9952. © 2020 American Society of Brewing Chemists, Inc.

Fatty acid profile and safety aspects of the edible oil prepared by artisans' at small-scale agricultural companies.		Food Science & Nutrition					The aim of this study was to analyze the fatty acid (FA) profiles and mycotoxin and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) concentrations in sea buckthorn (SB1, SB2), flaxseed (FL3, FL4, FL5), hempseed (HE6, HE7, HE8), camelina (CA9, CA10), and mustard (MU11) edible oils, prepared by artisans' by artisanal at small-scale agricultural companies in Lithuania. The dominant FAs were palmitic and oleic acids in SB; palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acids in FL; palmitic, stearic, oleic, linoleic, and alpha-linolenic acids in HE; palmitic, oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids in CA; and oleic, linoleic, alpha-linolenic, eicosenoic, and erucic acids in MU. In SB2 oil samples, T-2 toxin and zearalenone concentrations higher than 1.0 g/kg were found (1.7 and 3.0 g/kg, respectively). In sample FL4, an ochratoxin A concentration higher than 1.0 g/kg was established (1.2 g/kg); also, in HE8 samples, 2.0 g/kg of zearalenone was found. None of the tested edible oils exceeded the limits for PAH concentration. Finally, because of the special place of edible oils in the human diet, not only should their contamination with mycotoxins and PAHs be controlled but also their FA profile, as an important safety characteristic, must be taken into consideration to ensure higher safety standards. © 2021 The Authors.

The evaluation of dark chocolate-elicited emotions and their relation with physico chemical attributes of chocolate.		Foods					The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different origin (Venezuela, Ghana, Peru) dark chocolates on emotions induced for consumers, and to analyse the relationships among overall acceptability (OA), emotions, and physicochemical attributes of the chocolate (fatty acids (FAs) and volatile compounds (VC)). Chocolate-elicited emotions were measured with FaceReader 8 software, scaling 10 emotion patterns (neutral, happy, sad, angry, surprised, scared, disgusted, contempt, valence, arousal). The OA was carried out by using a 10-point hedonic scale, ranging from 1 (extremely dislike) to 10 (extremely like). The obtained results showed that, among all chocolate-elicited emotions, the intensity of "happy" was the highest. In most cases, the influence of the different origin chocolate on the emotions induced for consumers was significant (except on emotions "neutral", "scared", and "disgusted"). Significant differences between the tested chocolates OA were not found. The origin of chocolate had a significant effect on most of the identified VC and the content of the main FAs (methyl palmitate, methyl stearate, cis, trans-9-oleic acid methyl ester, and methyl linoleate). Significant correlations between chocolate-elicited emotions and separate FAs and VC were found. Finally, this study showed that the origin of dark chocolate significantly influenced most of chocolate-elicited emotions and physicochemical attributes of chocolate, while separate FAs or VC can be used as chocolate quality indicators related to the chocolate OA, as well as chocolate-elicited emotions. © 2021 by the authors.

Nutraceutical chewing candy formulations based on acetic, alcoholic, and lactofermented apple juice products.		Foods					The aim of this study was to develop nutraceutical chewing candy (NCC) formulations based on acetic, alcoholic, and lactofermented apple juice (AJ) products. In addition, different texture-forming (gelatin, pectin) and sweetening (stevia, xylitol) agents were tested. To implement the aim of this study, combinations based on AJ, prepared from fresh and frozen apples, apple cider (C) samples (No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4), and apple vinegar (V) were used. First, the most appropriate combination was selected by evaluating overall acceptability (OA) and emotions induced for consumers (EIC). In addition, the volatile compound (VC) profile, and physicochemical and antimicrobial characteristics of the developed combinations were analyzed. For AJ fermentation, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains possessing antimicrobial properties (LUHS122-L. plantarum and LUHS210-L. casei) were used. AJ prepared from frozen apples had 11.1% higher OA and 45.9%, 50.4%, and 33.3% higher fructose, glucose, and saccharose concentrations, respectively. All the tested C samples inhibited Bacillus subtilis and had an average OA of 6.6 points. Very strong positive correlations were found between AJ and C OA and the emotion "happy"; comparing lactofermented AJ, the highest OA was obtained for AJ fermented for 48 h with LUHS122, and a moderate positive correlation was found between AJ OA and the emotion "happy" (r=0.7617). This sample also showed the highest viable LAB count (7.59 log10 CFU mL-1) and the broadest spectrum of pathogen inhibition (inhibited 6 out of 10 tested pathogens). Further, acetic, alcoholic, and lactofermented AJ product combinations were tested. For the preparation of NCC, the combination consisting of 50 mL of AJ fermented with LUHS122 for 48 h+ 50 mL C-No. 3+ 2 mL V was selected because it showed the highest OA, induced a high intensity of the emotion "happy" for the judges, and inhibited 8 out of 10 tested pathogens. Finally, the OA of the prepared NCC was, on average, 9.03 points. The combination of acetic, alcoholic, and lactofermented AJ products leads to the formation of a specific VC profile and increases the OA and antimicrobial activity of the products which could be successfully applied in the food and nutraceutical industries. © 2021 by the authors.

The contribution of extruded and fermented wheat bran to the quality parameters of wheat bread, including the profile of volatile compounds and their relationship with emotions induced for consumers.		Foods					The aim of this study was to evaluate the contribution of extruded and fermented wheat bran (WBex-f) to the quality of wheat bread (BR), including the volatile compounds (VC) profile and VC relationship with emotions induced for consumers. A comparison study of BR (prepared with 5%, 10%, and 15% untreated wheat bran (nWB) and WBex-f) quality parameters was performed. It was established that nWB increases dough hardness and reduces BR specific volume. The addition of 5% and 10% of WBex-f was not significant on BR porosity and led to the formation of a high number of large pores. NWB and WBex-f increases the mass loss of BR after baking (by 13.38%), and the control breads showed the highest crust darkness, yellowness, and redness. NWB and WBex-f reduces BR firmness during storage, and WBex-f increases the overall acceptability (OA) of BR (by 26.2%). A strong positive correlation was found between OA and the emotion "happy" (r=0.8696). In BR prepared with WBex-f, a higher content of pyrazine, methyl-; pyrazine, 2-ethyl-; pyrazine, 2-ethyl-6-methyl-; furfural; ethanone, 1-(2-furanyl)-; benzaldehyde; and 3-furanmethanol was found. Finally, it can be stated that WBex-f could prolong the shelf life of BR and leads to the formation of a specific VC profile, which is associated with a higher OA of the product. © 2021 by the authors.

Combination of extrusion and fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum and L. uvarum strains for improving the safety characteristics of wheat bran.		Toxins					Processed wheat bran (W) is of great importance for food and feed. Consequently, the biosafety of W should be evaluated and improved with valorisation strategies. This study tested a design combining extrusion (at temperature of 115 and 130 °C; screw speeds of 16, 20, and 25 rpm) and fermentation with Lactobacillus plantarum and L. uvarum strains for the valorisation of W to provide safer food and feed stock. The influence of different treatments on biogenic amine formation, mycotoxin content, and free amino acids, as well as acidity, microbiological parameters, and sugar concentration, were analysed. This research showed that a combination of extrusion and fermentation with selected strains can change several aspects of W characteristics. There was a significant effect of applied treatments on acidity and the microbiological parameters of W, as well as biogenic amines content. The lowest total mycotoxin concentration (29.8 g/kg) was found in extruded (130 °C; 25 rpm) and fermented with L. uvarum sample. Finally, the combination of the abovementioned treatments can be confirmed as a prospective innovative pre-treatment for W, capable of potentially enhancing their safety characteristics and composition. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bartlova, M.; Tremlova, B.; Marcincak, S.; Pospiech, M.							Detection of carrageenan in meat products using lectin histochemistry.		Foods					Carrageenan is a polysaccharide that is widely used in the food industry. Due to its water holding capacity, there is a higher risk of adulteration for economic reasons related to it. A verifiable method for detecting carrageenan is still missing in the food inspection sector. The detection of carrageenan in meat products is not well described. Our study describes lectin histochemistry as a novel approach for carrageenan detection. Within this study, the detection of carrageenan in meat products by lectin histochemistry is validated. Lectins of Arachis hypogaea (PNA) and Bandeiraea simlicifolia (BSA), specific for galactose units of carrageenan, were used. The samples included model meat products (ground chicken-meat products) and meat products from retail markets (chicken and pork hams, sausages, salami, and dried sausages). The limit of determination (LoD) of this method was set at 0.01 g kg-1. The method sensitivity for lectin PNA reached 1, and, for lectin BSA, it reached 0.96. Method specificity for lectin PNA was 1, and, for lectin BSA, it was 1.33. Cross-reactivity with other hydrocolloids tested was not confirmed. The results confirm that lectin histochemistry is suitable for detecting carrageenan in meat products. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bartova, E.; Kobedova, K.; Budikova, M.; Racka, K.							Serological and molecular detection of Toxoplasma gondii in farm-reared ostriches (Struthio camelus) in the Czech Republic.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Toxoplasmosis is a globally spread disease, affecting humans and many animal species, including birds. Antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii were detected in ostriches from South and North America, Africa and Asia. Except for one study from Spain, there is a lack of information about T. gondii seroprevalence in ostriches from Europe. For this reason, the aim of the study was to detect antibodies to T. gondii in farm-reared ostriches from the Czech Republic. Serum samples of 409 ostriches (Struthio camelus), collected at 9 farms were tested by Latex agglutination test. Antibodies to T. gondii were detected in 149 (36%) birds with a statistical difference for individual farms (8%-71%, p = 0.0121), and regions (8%-65%, p = 0.002). Seropositivity did not statistically differ (p> 0.05) in size of farms (50% and 35% on small and large farms, respectively), sex of birds (38% and 35% in males and females, respectively), season and year of collection. Tissue samples (brain, heart, and pectoral muscle) of 105 birds were also tested by PCR to detect T. gondii DNA. The parasite T. gondii was detected in the brain and heart of one seronegative ostrich (1%) from a small farm. Based on our results, we can assume that ostriches may present high risk of toxoplasmosis for humans through consumption of raw or undercooked ostrich meat and even seronegative individuals could harbor T. gondii in their tissues. To our knowledge, this is the first serological detection of T. gondii in ostriches in the Czech Republic, and the first PCR detection in Europe.

Lead nitrate and cadmium chloride induced hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity: protective effects of sesamol on biochemical indices and pathological changes.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Lead nitrate (LN) and cadmium chloride (CdCl2), regarded as environmental contaminants, are toxic heavy metals. Sesamol is a dietary phytochemical found in sesame oil. We aimed to analyze the hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic effects of LN and CdCl2 and to evaluate the possible protective effect of sesamol. LN (90 mg/kg bw per day), CdCl2 (3 mg/kg bw per day), and sesamol (50 mg/kg bw per day) were given to rats via gavage for 28 days. Total protein, albumin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, total cholesterol, urea, uric acid, creatinine, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase, malondialdehyde, acetylcholinesterase, and histopathological changes were investigated in liver and kidney tissues. Lead and cadmium were found to result in decreases in the antioxidant enzymes and acetylcholinesterase activities, increases in malondialdehyde levels, and changes in serum biochemical parameters and various pathological findings. An improvement in all these parameters was observed in the sesamol-treated groups. Practical applications. Heavy metals are used in many areas of the industry all over the world. Heavy metals which include lead nitrate and cadmium chloride cause cell damage by oxidative stress. Some of the examining parameters for oxidative stress are SOD, GST, MDA, GPx, and CAT. However, some chemicals such as sesamol are well-liked and widely used as antioxidants against xenobiotic toxicity. We also indicate that sesamol has been shown to protective effect against heavy metals caused cell damage. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bas, S. D.; Gurkan, R.							Selective extraction and enrichment of 5-hydroymethylfurfural from honey, molasses, jam and vinegar samples prior to sensitive determination by micro-volume UV-vis spectrophotometry.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In this study, a new method was developed for the extraction/enrichment of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) from sample matrix prior to analysis. The method is based on the selective formation of the imine adduct and ion-pair between 5-HMF and phenosafranine (weak base, PSF+) in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at pH 5.5 by the base induced disproportionation. Then, the complexes were enriched into the micellar phase of Triton X-114, diluted with ethanol, and detected at 532 nm by micro-volume UV-vis spectrophotometry. The variables affecting extraction efficiency were optimized. In optimal conditions, the calibration curves were over the range of 2-100 and 2-200 mug L-1 with the detection limits of 0.53 and 0.75 mug L-1 using 0.2 and 3.0 mL of 1.0*10-3 mol L-1 SDS. From enrichment of 15-mL sample, an enrichment factor of 37.5-fold was obtained. The accuracy/ precision studies after spiking were performed, and observed to be in range of 97.3-102.3% and 2.5-3.8% (10,25 and 75 mug L-1, n: 5). After validation, the method was applied to the analysis of the selected foods. From the results, it was observed that 5-HMF levels were in the range of 1.05-18.10 mg kg-1 with a RSD% of 3.0-4.2% and recovery of 95.5-98.0% by sample extraction with sonication while they ranged from 1.15-18.05 mg kg-1 with a RSD% of 3.0-4.2% and recovery of 95-99% without sonication. Finally, it was observed that the results obtained were in agreements with those of the modified White method, statistically validating the method.

Effect of edible chitosan and cinnamon essential oil coatings on the shelf life of minimally processed pineapple (Smooth cayenne).		Food Bioscience					The objective of the present study was to evaluate the shelf life of minimally processed pineapple (Smooth cayenne) in terms of physicochemical, microbiological and sensory characteristics with an edible chitosan-based coating with the addition of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) in different concentrations, stored at 5 1 °C for 15 days. The pineapples were sanitized, peeled, and cut in pieces, immersed for 5 min in the coatings, and then drained. The minimally processed pineapples were stored in PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) packaging for a period of 15 days at 5 1 °C. Five treatments were established: (T1) control (without coating); (T2) 1% chitosan and 0.5% CEO; (T3) 1% chitosan and 1% CEO; (T4) 2% chitosan and 0.5% CEO, and (T5) 2% chitosan and 1% CEO. Weight loss, titratable acidity, pH, soluble solids content, color, firmness, microbiological evaluations of molds and yeasts, Salmonella spp and Escherichia coli, and sensory analysis were done in triplicate. The coatings used in this work were efficient in the conservation of minimally processed pineapple, when compared to the control sample, too reduced the growth of molds and yeasts, and the loss of weight and firmness. The treatment T4, showed the best results, lower weight loss (14.60%), lower decrease of L* (59.95%), proving to be efficient to retard microbial growth and prolong the shelf life of pineapple. These results can contribute to improving the marketing of minimally processed pineapple. All rights reserved, Elsevier.		CORTEZ-VEGA, WILLIAM RENZO W. R.

Journal of Medicinal Food					The larynx-related adverse effects that depend on cisplatin decrease patient comfort and many antioxidants have been used to eliminate these side effects. We aimed to identify the laryngeal mucosal changes imposed by cisplatin and investigated whether antioxidants, and their healing effects on these changes, may help reduce laryngeal complications in patients resulting from adverse effects in the larynx. A rat model was designed to evaluate the effects of cisplatin on the larynx and the protective role of antioxidants. Single-dose cisplatin was given both intraperitoneally alone and additionally administered with p-coumaric acid, melatonin, resveratrol, vitamin D, and oleic acid over 5 days. Whole larynges were dissected and evaluated histologically, histochemically, and immunohistochemically. Varying degrees of mucosal changes cisplatin group, but neither erosion nor an ulcer was observed. Numerous variable histological effects of antioxidants were observed on cisplatin exposed laryngeal mucosa. The most obvious effects of cisplatin were edema. The results of the study showed that resveratrol was the most preventive antioxidant agent against cisplatin-dependent mucosal changes. The highest increase in the Ki67 index was in the oleic acid group. Vitamin D increased stromal cyclooxygenase-2 expression that may have an effect on increasing mucosal damage.

J		Basar, A.; Karaoglu, M. M.							The effects of Cephalaria syriaca flour on physical, rheological and textural properties of sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps) damaged wheat dough and bread.		Journal of Cereal Science					The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Cephalaria syriaca flour (CSF; 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5%) on the physical, textural and rheological characteristics of dough and bread obtained from sunn pest-damaged wheat (SPDW; 5, 10 and 15%). An increased CSF level significantly decreased the stickiness and volume loss values of dough and the firmness and chewiness values of bread for all SPDW levels. The dough stickiness and bread firmness values were considerably increased by the addition of SPDW at the 15% level (1.05 N and 29.76 N), whereas these values were reduced by the addition of 1.5% CSF (0.6439 N and 22.56 N). In general, the stress relaxation, gas retention and gluten extensibility parameters of dough; and the specific volume, colour, cohesiveness, springiness and resilience values of bread significantly increased depending on the increasing level of CSF. Especially, the 1.5% CSF level significantly improved the quality of the dough and breads. The results of the present study revealed that CSF addition to SPDW flour positively affected the stickiness, gas retention and stress relaxation of dough and the specific volume and instrumental textural properties of bread.

J		Basaran, B.; Cakir, S.							Evaluation of food safety and halal criteria in supplier selection: an application in food sector with fuzzy COPRAS method.		International Food Research Journal					Supplier selection is among the crucial processes for any food industry operation. An incorrect choice when selecting a supplier will pose significant hazards in terms of food safety, and can cause substantial harm to virtually any operation of the enterprise. However, the number of studies focusing on this issue is rather limited, and the supplier selection procedure to serve as a source of reference for food producers has not been developed yet. The present work thus aimed to facilitate the use of food safety and halal criteria in supplier selection processes, and to help food producers in making choices by using the COPRAS-F method. The present work was carried out at an enterprise engaged in dairy products, analysed the processes involving four suppliers providing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging, and evaluated 12 criteria to guide the choice of supplier. The present work is one of the first attempts for supplier selection in food industry based on the COPRAS-F method. Results. Suggested that the COPRAS-F method could offer a practical method for not just supplier selection processes, but any multi-criteria decision-making problem a company might face.										2021	28	3	576	585	1985-4668									FSTA:2021-12-Pn6857
J		Basaran, B.; Turk, H.							The influence of consecutive use of different oil types and frying oil in French fries on the acrylamide level.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					In the literature, the effects of different frying oil types and consecutive frying sessions on acrylamide formation are still controversial. In this study, 8 consecutive frying sessions were applied with 4 different commercial oil products (sunflower oil, olive oil, corn oil, hazelnut oil) known to be used in French fries, and the formed acrylamide level in French fries was determined by LC-MS/MS. The relationship between variables was analyzed statistically. Acrylamide levels were measured as 890-1200 mug/kg in sunflower oil, 892-1163 mug/kg in olive oil, 981-1299 mug/kg in corn oil, and 779-1120 mug/kg in hazelnut oil. The poly-unsaturated fatty acid ratio of frying oil is thought to have a positive effect on acrylamide formation. The consecutive use of frying oil significantly affected acrylamide formation in French fries. In this study, consumers may be advised to use hazelnut and olive oil, and avoid corn oil, according to acrylamide levels detected in the French fries. Nevertheless, frying oil should not be used consecutively in French fries. These results can be used in studies to reduce acrylamide exposure from French fries. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Lignocellulose nanofibre obtained from agricultural wastes of tomato, pepper and eggplants improves the performance of films of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) for food packaging.		Foods					Films formulated with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) (synthetic biopolymer) were reinforced with lignocellulose nanofibres (LCNF) from residues of vegetable production (natural biopolymer). The LCNF were obtained by mechanical and chemical pre-treatment by 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO) and added to the polyvinyl alcohol (polymer matrix) with the aim of improving the properties of the film for use in food packaging. The mechanical properties, crystallinity, thermal resistance, chemical structure, antioxidant activity, water barrier properties and optical properties (transparency and UV barrier), were evaluated. In general, with the addition of LCNF, an improvement in the studied properties of the films was observed. In terms of mechanical properties, the films reinforced with 7% LCNF TEMPO showed the best results for tensile strength, Youngs modulus and elongation at break. At the same LCNF proportion, the thermal stability (Tmax) increased between 5.5% and 10.8%, and the antioxidant activity increased between 90.9% and 191.8%, depending on the raw material and the pre-treatment used to obtain the different LCNF. Finally, a large increase in UV blocking was also observed with the addition of 7% LCNF. In particular, the films with 7% of eggplant LCNF showed higher performance for Youngs modulus, elongation at break, thermal stability and UV barrier. Overall, results demonstrated that the use of LCNF generated from agricultural residues represents a suitable bioeconomy approach able to enhance film properties for its application in the development of more sustainable and eco-friendly food packaging systems. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bascuas, S.; Morell, P.; Quiles, A.; Salvador, A.; Hernando, I.							Use of oleogels to replace margarine in steamed and baked buns.		Foods					Bakery products are usually formulated with solid fats, like margarines and shortenings, which contain high levels of saturated and trans-fatty acids and have negative effects on human health. In this study, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum (XG) were used as oleogelators to prepare oleogels, using sunflower and olive oil, as substitutes for margarine in baked or steamed buns. The effect of oleogels on the physical properties of the buns was evaluated by analyzing the crumb structure, specific volume, height, and texture. In addition, a triangular discriminatory sensory test was conducted, and lipid digestibility was assessed through in vitro digestion studies. Replacement of margarine with oleogels produced steamed buns with no differences in the crumb structure, volume, height, and texture; however, in baked buns, a less porous and harder structure was produced. No differences in texture were observed between the margarine buns and buns made with oleogels when the triangular test was conducted. The extent of lipolysis was not affected when margarine was replaced by oleogels in the baked and steamed buns. The results suggest that using oleogels instead of margarine in buns could represent an interesting strategy to prepare healthier bakery products. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bascuas, S.; Espert, M.; Llorca, E.; Quiles, A.; Salvador, A.; Hernando, I.							Structural and sensory studies on chocolate spreads with hydrocolloid-based oleogels as a fat alternative.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, chocolate spreads were designed using oleogels with two oils (olive and sunflower), and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) and xanthan gum (XG), as structuring agents. Thus, the lipid profile of the spreads can be improved by totally or partially replacing the coconut butter used in their preparation. Structural behaviour was analysed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), small amplitude oscillatory rheology, and a spreadability test. A Free Choice Profile analysis was performed by consumers to determine the sensorial attributes that described the chocolate spreads. The results showed that the oleogels conferred consistency to the spreads because of the network formed by HPMC and XG. However, while coconut butter replacement at 50% gave a similar structure to the control spread, 100% replacement resulted in less homogeneous spreads. This trend might be attributed to the chemical compatibility between the oleogel-coconut butter, which led to stronger systems. Sensory evaluation showed that chocolate spread replaced by sunflower oleogel at 50% presented sensory attributes like the control spread with "creamy appearance", "creamy texture", and "cocoa flavour". Therefore, using oleogels can be a viable and healthy alternative to replace the saturated fat present in chocolate spreads. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Sakr							Whole and refined grains change behavior and reduce brain derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin-3 in rats.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In most of the world, wheat is one of the main staple foods, and is also widely used in livestock feed. In the current study, we investigated the effects of wheat grain consumption on the rat behavior and neurogenesis markers. Thirty male rats were divided into three equal groups (n=10). Group 1 was the control group fed with chow diet (Carbohydrates 63%, fat 13% and protein 24%), the Group 2 rats were fed with whole grains and the Group 3 rats were fed with refined grains. After 12 weeks, we measured the hippocampal and prefrontal cortical brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), 5-hydroxytryptamine, dopamine, norepinephrine, malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels. Also, we evaluated the rat behavior by forced swimming test (FST) and elevated plus maze (EPM) test. Additionally, we measured serum level of glucose, lipid profile, insulin and cortisol. Weight gain at the end of the study was measured in each group. The rats on a diet of whole and refined grains had low BDNF, NT-3, norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin significantly (p<.01) in both the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex as compared to control rats. Moreover, the MDA increased significantly with significant reduction in GSH versus the control rats. Moreover, in response to grain consumption, the performance in FST showed a significant (p<.01) shortage in the latency of the attempts to escape as well as a significant prolongation (p<.01) in behavioral immobility as compared to control rats with significant (p<.05) prolongation in time spent in closed arm in EPM. An exclusive diet of either whole or refined grain in a rat model induced anxiety and depressive behaviors and negatively affected the BDNF and NT-3 and modulated the level of the neurotransmitters with significant shift in their behavior. Practical applications. Grains are considered the major caloric source all over the world that may predispose to the development of chronic diseases. In this research, we evaluated the role of grains in modulating the rate of production of neurogenic factors in rats. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	8			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13867					FSTA:2021-11-Mj7106
J		Basharat Yousuf; Shimin Wu; Yuan Gao							Characteristics of karaya gum based films: amelioration by inclusion of Schisandra chinensis oil and its oleogel in the film formulation.		Food Chemistry					This research was focused to develop novel karaya gum films, modified by adding Schisandra chinensis oil and its oleogel. The films produced were assessed for physicochemical, mechanical, thermal and structural characteristics. Glass transition temperature (Tg) of control karaya gum films was recorded as 145.70 °C. Insignificant (p < 0.05) changes occurred in Tg of films in which oil was incorporated, irrespective of the concentration. However, Tg decreased significantly (p < 0.05) as oleogel was added to the karaya gum films and lowest Tg occurred for the KGOG3 films which contained highest concentration of oleogel. X-ray diffraction test depicted an obsolete amorphous behavior of control karaya gum film whereas some peaks appeared in other film samples. Scanning electron micrography (SEM) revealed a reduction in roughness and grainy morphology when oil or oleogel was added to the films. Addition of oil/oleogel enhanced the phenolic content and DPPH radical scavenging activity of the films.

Reduction of T-2 and HT-2 mycotoxins by atmospheric cold plasma and its impact on quality changes and germination of wheat grains.		Journal of Food Science					Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is susceptible to mycotoxin contamination, which can result in significant health risks and economic losses. This research examined the ability of air atmospheric cold plasma (air-ACP) treatment to reduce pure and spiked T-2 and HT-2 mycotoxins' concentration on wheat grains. This study also evaluated the effect of ACP treatment using different gases on wheat grain germination parameters. The T-2 and HT-2 mycotoxin solutions applied on round cover-glass were placed on microscopy slides and wheat grains (0.5 g) were individually spiked with T-2 and HT-2 on their surfaces. Samples were then dried at room temperature (~24 °C) and treated by air-ACP for 1 to 10 min. Ten minutes of air-ACP treatment significantly reduced pure T-2 and HT-2 concentrations by 63.63% and 51.5%, respectively. For mycotoxin spiked on wheat grains, 10 min air-ACP treatment significantly decreased T-2 and HT-2 concentrations up to 79.8% and 70.4%, respectively. No significant change in the measured quality and color parameters was observed in the ACP-treated samples. Wheat grain germination parameters were not significantly different, when treated with ACP using different gases. Air-ACP treatment and ACP treatment using 80% nitrogen+ 20% oxygen improved the germination of wheat grains by 10% and 6%, respectively. This study demonstrated that ACP is an innovative technology with the potential to improve the safety of wheat grains by reducing T-2/HT-2 mycotoxins with an additional advantage of improving their germination. Practical Application. Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) technology has a huge potential to degrade mycotoxins in food grains. This study evaluated the efficacy of ACP to reduce two major mycotoxins (T-2 and HT-2 toxins) in wheat grains. The results of this study will help to develop and scale-up the ACP technology for mycotoxin degradation in grains. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists.										2021	86	4	1354	1371	0022-1147				10.1111/1750-3841.15658					FSTA:2021-08-Mj4720

Large-scale sequencing and comparative analysis of oenological Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains supported by nanopore refinement of key genomes.		Food Microbiology					Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long been part of human activities related to the production of food and wine. The industrial demand for fermented beverages with well-defined and stable characteristics boosted the isolation and selection of strains conferring a distinctive aroma profile to the final product. To uncover variants characterizing oenological strains, the sequencing of 65 new S. cerevisiae isolates, and the comparison with other 503 publicly available genomes were performed. A hybrid approach based on short Illumina and long Oxford Nanopore reads allowed the in-depth investigation of eleven genomes and the identification of putative laterally transferred regions and structural variants. A comparative analysis between clusters of strains belonging to different datasets allowed the identification of novel relevant genetic features including single nucleotide polymorphisms, insertions and structural variants. Detection of oenological single nucleotide variants shed light on the existence of different levels of modulation for the mevalonate pathway relevant for the biosynthesis of aromatic compounds.

Foods					Texture characteristics are valuable parameters in the perceived quality and overall acceptability of fresh fruit. The characterization of grape texture attributes, such as firmness and crunchiness, is usually performed by sensory analysis or instrumental texture analysis. Both methodologies are destructive. Hence, it is not possible to test multiple times or perform any other analysis on the same sample. In this article, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy was applied to intact berries of table grape cv. Regal Seedless. NIR spectra were employed to predict both the physical parameter "hardness", which is correlated with the crunchiness of berry flesh and the sweetness, which is correlated with the total soluble solids content (TSS, as °Brix). The chemometric analysis was carried out exclusively based on an open-source software environment, producing results readily usable for any operator, besides the specific level of experience with NIR spectroscopy. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Baskaya Sezer, D.; Jasim Ahmed; Gulum Sumnu; Serpil Sahin							Green processing of sour cherry (Prunus cerasus L.) pomace: process optimization for the modification of dietary fibers and property measurements.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Commercial processing of sour cherries generates a large quantity of pomace as an industrial waste, which can suitably be converted into value-added fiber-rich products by employing appropriate extraction techniques. In this work, an array of techniques [microwave (MW), high-pressure (HP), enzymatic and thermal treatments] was employed to improve the yield of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) in sour cherry pomace (SCP) by breaking down the insoluble dietary fiber into a soluble form, and characterizes by total phenolic content, antioxidant capacity and other property measurements. It was found that a combination of MW (850 W/60 s) and HP treatment (600 MPa/15 min) resulted in the maximum yield of SDF (63%). However, individually the MW-heating (44.6%) had an edge on extraction over the HP-treatment (21.9%). Micrographs of MW-HP-600 treated samples exhibited an array of disordered smaller particle fragments spread over the larger particles. HP treatment improved the water holding capacity from 10.12 to 11.76 g/g after 600 MPa treatment. The peak values of the solubility index (46.9 to 49.6%) achieved in the sample containing elevated SDF content (the combination of either MW and HP, or MW, EH, and HP). The optimized process produced the maximum total phenolic (5.39 mg GAE/g d.b.) and DPPH (9.94 mmol DPPH/100 g d.b.) contents in the treated pomace. The combination of microwave, enzymatic hydrolysis and high-pressure treatments can loosen the surface structure of SCP-DF, enhance hydration properties by exposing hydrophilic groups more, extract a higher amount of phenolic compounds providing antioxidant activity improvement besides increasing SDF ratio in SCP. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	4	3015	3025	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00883-0					FSTA:2021-12-Jd17150
J		Bass, D. A.; McFadden, B. R.; Messer, K. D.							A case for measuring negative willingness to pay for consumer goods.		Food Policy					Negative willingness to pay (WTP) has received significant attention in the environmental economics literature but generally has been ignored by economists interested in measuring consumer preferences for food and beverages. Most consumer preference studies have focused solely on WTP measures and, in most cases, have treated negative consumer responses to a product as equivalent to consumers simply not wanting to purchase it since both sentiments have a WTP estimate of $0. However, for some goods such as bottled water, this approach can be an oversimplification that fails to reveal consumers' true sentiments, a problem that is relevant in policy contexts. To test this question, we conduct a randomized controlled study involving 1384 adult consumers that tests how three unconventional elicitation approaches affect estimates of consumer preferences for nearly identical goods: bottled water and tap water. We find that stated values for both types of water differ by treatment and that ignoring negative WTP values upwardly biases the premium consumers are willing to pay for bottled water. Our findings show that allowing negative values of WTP provides more-accurate valuations and measures of differences in valuations for two goods, something that is particularly important for policymaking since consumer valuations can reflect their support for efforts to address externalities associated with consumer goods or may reflect other consumer sentiments, such as food safety concerns.

J		Bassett, A.; Hooper, S.; Cichy, K.							Genetic variability of cooking time in dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) related to seed coat thickness and the cotyledon cell wall.		Food Research International					Dry beans are an affordable, nutritious food that often require long cooking times. Storage time and conditions, growing environment, and genotype influence cooking times. Little is known about factors underlying genetic variation for cooking time. Using fast and slow cooking genotypes from four different seed types (brown, cranberry, red mottled, yellow), the objectives of this study were to (1) characterize genetic variability for cooking time across multiple soaking time points; (2) determine the roles of seed coat and cotyledon cell wall physical traits in genetic variability for cooking time; and (3) identify seed coat and cotyledon cell wall compositional differences associated with genetic variability for cooking time. Genotypes were evaluated for cooking time on unsoaked beans and beans soaked for 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Cooking times were sharply reduced after 3 h of soaking and plateaued after 6 h of soaking. Interestingly, the genotypes in each pair that cooked faster when soaked did not necessarily cook faster when unsoaked. Greater seed coat percentage, cotyledon cell wall thickness, total and insoluble whole seed dietary fiber, and insoluble cotyledon cell wall isolate were genotypic factors associated with longer cooking times of soaked beans. Thicker seed coat macrosclereid- and osteosclereid-layers were genotypic factors associated with longer cooking times of unsoaked beans. These findings suggest that cotyledon cell wall thickness and composition have a significant role in genetic variability for cooking time of soaked beans and seed coat layer thickness relates to the genetic variability for cooking time of unsoaked beans.

O.; Keping Ye; Chunbao Li; Guanghong Zhou							Evaluation of spoilage indexes and bacterial community dynamics of modified atmosphere packaged super-chilled pork loins.		Food Control					Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is widely adopted for meats and meat products. While an effective cold chain may provide microbial safety during storage, several key spoilers, active at these conditions, can still induce spoilage. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of MAP on spoilage indexes and bacterial population of predominant spoilers in fresh pork loins at super-chilling (-2°C) storage for 28 d. The results showed a negligible color improvement in Group A after 14 d while reduced TVB-N (13.33 vs 16.58 mg N/100 g), TBARS (1.79 vs 2.28 MDA/kg), TVC (6.5 vs 7.2 log CFU/g), and psychrotrophic bacteria count (6.1 vs 6.8 log CFU/g) were found in Group B in comparison to control group (D) at the end of storage. The abundance of Pseudomonas spp., Brochothrix spp., lactic acid bacteria, and Photobacteria spp., regarded as predominant spoilers of meat, in general, was influenced by the gas composition used in the packages. Although the abundance of specific spoilers, such as Serratia liquefaciens and Carnobacterium divergens, were reduced in Group C, significant inhibitions of Pseudomonas spp., Brochothrix spp., Serratia spp., Hafnia spp., Acinetobacter spp., Kurthia spp., and Kocuria spp. were detected in Group B packs over time. Nevertheless, Pseudomonas spp. And Brochothrix spp. were the abundant spoilers detected among different groups, hence, it is necessary to elucidate their adaptive mechanisms in the cold chain. Further studies into their spoilage and adaptive mechanisms are needed in order to control their proliferation in meat during storage. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

B.; Keping Ye; Chunbao Li; Guanghong Zhou							Assessment of quality characteristics and bacterial community of modified atmosphere packaged chilled pork loins using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis.		Food Research International					Modified atmosphere packaging (MAP) is widely applied in packaging meat and meat products. While most studies had employed culture-dependent microbiological analyses or polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE), the recent application of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) has been effective and reliable in detecting the microbial consortium associated with food spoilage. Since MAP application is limited in China, applying HTS in assessing the microbial consortium of meat and meat products in the country becomes imperative. In this study, quality indexes and bacterial enumeration often used as spoilage indicators were employed to assess MAP fresh pork under chilled (4 °C) storage for 21 d. The results indicated that 70%O2/30%CO2 (Group A) retained more redness (a*) content, while 70%N2/30%CO2 (Group B) markedly reduced spoilage indicators compared to the control group. Notably, high-throughput sequencing indicated that Group B and 20%O2/60%N2/20%CO2 (Group C) inhibited the growth of abundant spoilers, Pseudomonas spp. and Brochothrix spp. Thus, MAP (Group B and C) has promising potential in inhibiting predominant meat spoilers during chilled storage. This study provides valuable information to food industries on the potential application of MAP to control meat spoilage in Chinese markets. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Basso, F.; Manzocco, L.; Maifreni, M.; Nicoli, M. C.							Hyperbaric storage of egg white at room temperature: effects on hygienic properties, protein structure and technological functionality.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Fresh hen (Gallus gallus domesticus) egg white was submitted to hyperbaric storage at 200 MPa at room temperature for up to 28 days. Control samples were stored at 4 °C and 0.1 MPa. Storage conditions were compared for antimicrobial capacity towards inoculated (circa 4 log CFU g-1) Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica, and changes in physical, structural and functional properties. S. enterica was completely inactivated within 3 h of hyperbaric storage. Prolonged hyperbaric storage promoted slight egg white yellowing, probably due to non-enzymatic browning or riboflavin-protein decomplexation, and induced minor changes in egg white protein structure. Partial conversion of ovalbumin into S-ovalbumin led to slightly decreased gelling capacity. Pressurized egg white proteins also resulted slightly compressed and electrically stabilized, becoming more prone to solvent interactions. Based on these effects, viscosity of egg white increased almost 4-fold and foaming capacity increased by circa 35%. Our work demonstrated for the first time that hyperbaric storage guarantees safety and hygiene of egg white without detriment to its technological functionality. Industrial relevance Hyperbaric storage could represent an interesting alternative to refrigeration due to its capability to preserve food hygienic properties. Concomitantly, it could be used to pasteurize and even enhance technological functionality of protein-rich food ingredients. These goals could be achieved with negligible energetic consumption if working units were made viable for industrial application. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

V.; Harman, C. L.							A chemical structure-based approach for estimating the added levels of flavourings to foods for the purpose of assessing consumer intake.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Intake assessment and hazard profile of chemical substances are the two critical inputs in a safety assessment. Human intake assessment presents challenges that stem either from the absence of data or from numerous sources of variability and uncertainty, which have led regulators to adopt conservative approaches that inevitably overestimate intake. Refinements of intake assessments produce more realistic estimates and help prioritise areas of concern and better direct investment of resources. However, use levels (ULs), which represent the usual added amount of flavourings to food products, are the starting point for refined intake assessments, are data-intensive, and data availability is often a limitation. The work presented here was undertaken to investigate the use level patterns of substances used as flavourings in foods and to develop a systematic tool for data extrapolation based on chemical structure. The available dataset consists of use levels reported through eight industry surveys and hence are representative of industry uses rather than regulatory limits, which are higher by design and not realistic. A systematic statistical analysis was undertaken to determine whether the industry-reported UL data can be used to estimate use levels of flavouring substances belonging to the same chemical group for which such data are not available. Predictive modelling approaches were explored to evaluate relationships in the data and utilised additional variables relevant to technological considerations, such as volatility losses upon heat treatment, and Tanimoto index-based pair-wise structural similarity scores to determine whether more granular similarity information can reduce the within-group variability. The analyses indicated that the use levels of flavouring substances can reasonably be estimated based on the available data using chemical group classifications stratified by food category. Source of uncertainty and limitations are discussed. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.			, Tom/0000-0001-9389-774X; Bastaki, Maria/0000-0003-4487-1150							2021	38	1	33	59	1944-0049				10.1080/19440049.2020.1837398					FSTA:2021-05-Tb1788

Biobased films of nanocellulose and mango leaf extract for active food packaging: supercritical impregnation versus solvent casting.		Food Hydrocolloids					Antioxidant and antimicrobial free-standing films composed of nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC) and a polyphenolic-rich extract, viz. Mango leaf extract (MLE), were produced via supercritical solvent impregnation (SSI) and conventional solvent casting film-processing methodologies. The CO2-assisted impregnation of NFC with MLE created robust films with thermal stability up to 250 °C, good mechanical performance (Young's modulus > 4.7 GPa), UV-light barrier properties, antioxidant capacity with maximum inhibition percentage of ca. 84%, and antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (growth inhibition37%) and Escherichia coli (growth inhibition91%). The comparison of the NFC/MLE films prepared by SSI with those fabricated via solvent casting shows a clear advantage of the SSI methodology. Particularly, the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities are visibly higher in the films fabricated by the CO2-assisted impregnation of MLE into NFC. In fact, for the SSI films, the MLE components are mostly adsorbed at the surface and not in the bulk of the biopolymeric matrix, which translates into faster migrations and, hence, higher active properties. All these findings evinced the potential performance of the NFC/MLE films prepared by the eco-friendly SSI as UV-blocking, antioxidant, and antimicrobial bio-based materials for application as sustainable active food packaging.

J		Bastiani, F. H.; Sufredini, S.; Romio, A. P.; Nicolin, D. J.							Modeling the drying kinetics of alginate particles considering shrinkage.		Journal of Food Process Engineering					Alginate is an anionic and biodegradable biopolymer of natural occurrence, typically obtained from brown algae, being studied, and used in several applications in biomedicine and food industry by its low toxicity, low cost, and its gelification obtained by the addition of bivalent cations (Ca2+), besides being able to storage large amounts of liquid in its structure. In this context, this work aims to study the drying and shrinkage kinetics of this biomaterial. Microparticles of alginate were synthesized by the ionic gelification method using calcium chloride as reticulant agent. These microparticles were submitted to drying experiments conducted at 40, 50, and 60°C. A mathematical model which considers the microparticles moisture and volume change with time was proposed to model the drying process. Considering that the radius depends on time as Page and Sigmoid equations, two mathematical models were obtained. Both models were able to describe the experimental data and the kinetic parameters were adjusted as an exponential function of temperature (R2 = 0.99). The statistical analysis of the residues between calculated and experimental data indicates an adequate prediction, with Page's model fitting more accurately to the data sets. Akaike's test also indicated the coupled Page model as the most adequate. Practical Applications. The results presented in this paper provide mathematical methods of modelling the hydration kinetics of alginate particles and fitting the parameters which can help understanding the mass transfer and shrinkage phenomena during drying. Those characteristics are essential in describing alginate particles due to the high amount of water that they contain. Describing the drying kinetics of such particles may help to project and optimize equipment involved in alginate particles production process. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Metabolism of flavonoids and lignans by lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains improves the nutritional properties of flaxseed-enriched beverages.		Food Research International					Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is of interest as functional food because of the presence of compounds in its composition with potential health benefits, such as fatty acid omega-3, fiber, lignans and flavonoids. The bioactivity of lignans and flavonoids depends greatly on bacterial metabolism. Previously, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains were described to produce enterolignans and bioactive flavonoids (herbacetin, quercetin, quercetagetin, kaempferol, naringenin and eriodictyol) from flaxseed extracts and/or from secoisolariciresinol (SECO) in culture medium. In this work, cow's milk and soy beverage were supplemented with flaxseed extracts and fermented with selected lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains. Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus INIA P224, Limosilactobacillus mucosae INIA P508 and Lactiplantibacillus plantarum ESI 144 were capable of producing enterolactone (ENL) in both beverages supplemented with flaxseed, in addition to matairesinol and the flavonoids daidzein, genistein, glycitein, quercetin, naringenin, kaempferol and eriodictyol. On the other hand, Bifidobacterium breve INIA P367, Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum INIA P815 and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum INIA P946 were able to produce quercetin, quercetagetin and high concentrations of herbacetin and SECO, in addition to pinoresinol, matairesinol, daidzein, genistein, naringenin, kaempferol and eriodictyol. The co-incubation of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei INIA P74 and Ligilactobacillus salivarius INIA P183 with Lactococcus lactis MG1363 harboring the food grade vector pLEB590. Gly913, facilitated the production of ENL in soy beverage enriched with flaxseed. In this work, it is demonstrated how lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains can improve the nutritional properties of flaxseed-enriched beverages, providing metabolites of great interest for human health.

International Journal of Food Microbiology					The isoflavones daidzin and genistin, present in soybeans, can be transformed by the intestinal microbiota into equol and 5-hydroxy-equol, compounds with enhanced availability and bioactivity, although these are only produced by a fraction of the population. Hence, there is an interest in the production of these compounds, although, to date, few bacteria with biotechnological interest and applicability in food have been found able to produce equol. In order to obtain lactic acid bacteria able to produce equol, the daidzein reductase (dzr), dihydrodaidzein reductase (ddr), tetrahydrodaidzein reductase (tdr) and dihydrodaidzein racemase (ifcA) genes, from Slackia isoflavoniconvertens DSM22006, were cloned into the vector pNZ: TuR, under a strong constitutive promoter (TuR). Lactococcus lactis MG1363, Lacticaseibacillus casei BL23, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum WCFS1, Limosilactobacillus fermentum INIA 584L and L. fermentum INIA 832L, harbouring pNZ: TuR. Tdr. Ddr, were able to produce equol from dihydrodaidzein, while L. fermentum strains showed also production of 5-hydroxy-equol from dihydrogenistein. The metabolization of daidzein and genistein by the combination of strains harbouring pNZ: TuR. Dzr and pNZ: TuR. Tdr. Ddr showed similar results, and the addition of the correspondent strain harbouring pNZ: TuR. IfcA resulted in an increase of equol production, but only in the L. fermentum strains. This pattern of equol and 5-hydroxy-equol production by L. fermentum strains was also confirmed in cow's milk supplemented with daidzein and genistein and incubated with the different combination of strains harbouring the constructed plasmids. Bacteria generally recognized as safe (GRAS), such as the lactic acid bacteria species used in this work, harbouring these plasmids, would be of value for the development of fermented vegetal foods enriched in equol and 5-hydroxy-equol.

Spectroscopic (LC-ESI-MS/MS, FT-IR, NMR) and functional characterization of fruit seed oils extracted with green technology: a comparative study with Prunus cerasus and Punica granatum oils.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Sour cherry seed oil (SCSO) and pomegranate seed oil (PSO) were extracted by using cold-press technology and characterized in terms of physicochemical properties, bioactive compound contents, biological activity, and spectroscopic features. They were rich in unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs). The predominant carotenoid was zeaxanthin (13.15 mg/kg) for SCSO and beta-carotene (33.45 mg/kg) for PSO. Naringenin, ellagic acid, resveratrol, kaempferol, catechin, and gallic acid were found to be the major secondary metabolites in the samples by LC/MS-MS. Further analysis of phenolic compounds and fatty acids were conducted by using13C and1H NMR. Functional groups of the oils were analyzed by FT-IR spectra. DPPH, ABTS, FRAP, and CUPRAC assays were used to investigate the antioxidant activity. The alpha-glucosidase inhibition activity of SCSO and PSO was 4.38 and 5.16 mg/ml, respectively. SCSO exhibited antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus although the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli was inhibited by the PSO. Practical applications. There is remarkable demand for cold-pressed seed oils instead of other oils in western countries, recently. The results showed that sour cherry seed oil and pomegranate seed oil have the potential to improve the nutritional value of food and/or pharmaceutical materials thanks to their natural bioactive compounds, especially UFAs. Therefore, these seed oils could be evaluated as an enrichment ingredient in the various formulations instead of other oils used in different industries. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Postharvest Biology and Technology					The effects of a sodium alginate (SA) coating combined withl-cysteine (L-cys) and citric acid (CA) on browning and microbial growth in fresh-cut lotus root slices during storage at 4 °C were investigated. The SA+L-cys+CA treatment was more efficient than separate SA andl-cys+CA treatments in the maintenance of visual appearance and flavour quality. The SA+L-cys+CA coating improved the ability of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase) to scavenge reactive oxygen species, including O2.- and H2O2. In comparison to the control, the SA+L-cys+CA treatment lowered the activity of phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, and membrane lipid-degrading enzymes (phospholipase D, lipase and lipoxygenase) and furthermore, maintained high amounts of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids as well as low levels of phenolics and malondialdehyde. The bacterial diversity in lotus root slices was also determined and discussed. The SA+L-cys+CA treatment could maintain the shelf-life of fresh-cut lotus root slices for 14 d at 4 °C, which provides a theoretical basis for commercial application.

Encapsulation in alginate-polymers improves stability and allows controlled release of the UFV-AREG1 bacteriophage.		Food Research International					The bacteriophage UFV-AREG1 was used as a model organism to evaluate the encapsulation via extrusion using different hydrocolloids. Pure alginate [0.75%, 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% (m/v)] and mixtures of alginate [0.75% or 1.0% (m/v)] with carrageenan [1.25% (m/v)], chitosan [0.5% (m/v)], or whey protein [1.5% (m/v)] were used to produce bacteriophage-loaded beads. The encapsulating solutions presented flow behavior of non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids and the concentration of hydrocolloid did not influence (p > 0.05) the morphology of the beads, except for alginate-chitosan solutions, which presented the higher flow consistency index (K) and the lower flow behavior index (n). The encapsulation efficiency was about 99% and the confocal photomicrography of the encapsulated bacteriophages labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate showed homogenous distribution of the viral particles within the beads. The phages remained viable in the beads of alginate-whey protein even when submitted to pH 2.5 for 2 h. Beads incubated directly in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) resulted in a minimal of 50% release of the UFV-AREG1 phages after 5 min, even when previously submitted to the simulated gastric fluid (pH 2.5). Encapsulation enabled phages to remain viable under refrigeration for five months. Encapsulated UFV-AREG1 phages were sensitive to dehydration, suggesting the need for protective agents. In this study, for the first-time bacteriophages were encapsulated in alginate-carrageenan beads, as well as alginate-chitosan as a bead-forming hydrocolloid. In addition, a novel procedure for encapsulating bacteriophages in alginate-whey protein was proposed. The assembled system showed efficiency in the encapsulation of UFV-AREG1 bacteriophages using different hydrocolloids and has potential to be used for the entrapment of a variety of bioactive compounds.

Effects of cold plasma on avocado pulp (Perseaamericana Mill.): chemical characteristics and bioactive compounds.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					The effects of cold plasma on the enzymatic activity, color, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activity of avocado pulp with lime extract (PL) and without extract (PW) were studied. The experimental conditions applied varied with regard to time (10, 20, and 30 min) and gas flow (10, 20, and 30 ml). The gas flow combination of 20 ml/20 min applied in PL was efficient for reducing POD and PPO activities and browning index as well as for color maintenance. Cold plasma increased the phenolic and carotenoid levels in PW in T1 and T2 (gas flow 10 ml/10-30 min) and in PL in T3 and T8 (gas flow 30 ml/10 min and 20 ml/30 min), which contributed to the improvement in antioxidant activity. The phenolic showed a strong correlation with ORAC-H in PL (0.85) and PW (0.75). Myristic and palmitic acid were reduced after applying cold plasma, however, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic increased the content. It is concluded that the synergistic effect of lime extract in avocado pulp with cold plasma technology is efficient at maintaining the quality characteristics and improving the bioactive content. Practical applications. Cold plasma processing is an alternative method of effective maintenance for enzyme control, and it also shows promising results in the conservation of chemical quality and in increasing the levels of bioactive compounds and increasing the antioxidant capacity in fruit products, such as avocado pulp. Avocado has gained prominence in the market due to knowledge of its nutritional characteristics; however, its commercialization is hampered mainly by a high concentration of enzymes that cause enzymatic browning, such as polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase, which favor the appearance of degradation reactions, compromising the quality of the fruit. Available information on the effect of this conservation technology on this type of matrix has not been found, and this is one of the first studies to address the effect of cold plasma processing on avocado pulp, providing information for the food industry. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Artificial neural networks modeling of non-fat yogurt texture properties: effect of process conditions and food composition.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					Texture is one of the main characteristics involved in the acceptance of yogurt and must be monitored for the quality control of the product and for the adequate layout of the processing units. However, the determination of these properties requires expensive equipment, such as rotational rheometers, inaccessible to many industries. Thus, the modeling of artificial neural networks (ANNs) was applied to predict the texture properties of yogurt (output) based on changes in formulation and process conditions (inputs). Non-fat yogurts were produced with different centrifugation conditions and concentrations of protein and enzyme transglutaminase. Three models were developed: ANN-TPA to predict the properties obtained in the analysis of the texture profile (TPA), and ANN-TIX and ANN-VIS to predict thixotropy and viscosity, respectively. The enzymatic and protein variables had an impact of 46.3% and 53.6%, respectively, on the response of ANN-TPA. The shear rate had an impact of 83.7% and 86.0% on the thixotropy and apparent viscosity, respectively. The ANNs were able to predict responses with good precision (R2>0.95) and low root mean square error (RMSE), showing their potential to be used as a tool to predict the properties of yogurt.

J		Batkowska, J.; Drabik, K.; Brodacki, A.; Czech, A.; Adamczuk, A.							Fatty acids profile, cholesterol level and quality of table eggs from hens fed with the addition of linseed and soybean oil.		Food Chemistry					The study objective was to assess the impact of soybean (SO) and linseed oil (LO) added to feed mixture for laying hens upon the quality characteristics of table eggs, their fatty acid (FA) profile and cholesterol level. The material consisted of eggs from hens fed with a mixture without oil and with the addition of LO or SO in a dose of 2.5%. Eggs were subjected to quality assessment. FA profile and cholesterol content in yolks were determined. The results indicate no negative changes in eggs' quality caused by supplementation. An increase was observed in the n3 FA content in egg yolk in experimental groups, as well as all PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids) proportions. No negative impact of these oils on the level of cholesterol was noted. As a consequence, the analysed feed additives can be safely applied as an appropriate material in poultry nutrition to enrich eggs with PUFA. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Battagin, H. V.; Panea, B.; Trindade, M. A.							Study on the lamb meat consumer behavior in Brazil.		Foods					In Brazil, the sheep market, including lamb meat consumption, is regionalized, and the consumption of lamb meat is higher in production areas; yet, consumption of lamb still remains below that of other meat livestock. The aim of this study was to identify the profile of Brazilian lamb meat consumers in order to understand their behavior in relation to food in general and on the consumption of this species. Therefore, a survey on consumer habits and preferences regarding food buying and consumption habits, their preferences in relation to the quality attributes of lamb meat, and sociodemographic characterization was performed. Data collected were analyzed by nonlinear canonic relationship analysis and categorical principal component analysis, followed by multiple factor analysis. Three consumer profiles were identified: traditional, interested, and disinterested, and a fourth group was considered independent but could not be described. Among lamb meat consumers, men with higher income seemed to be more frequent consumers than the others, and the intrinsic characteristics of meat quality, especially color and freshness, were the most important at the time of purchase. Thus, the results could be important to the industry in order to guide marketing strategies to certain niche markets. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Syzygium aromaticum (clove) essential oil: an alternative for the sanitization of citrus fruit in packinghouses.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Citrus canker is a quarentenary disease caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (X. citri). Thus, sanitization of fresh fruit is a necessary measure before any commercial activity. Therefore, we evaluated the clove essential oil (CEO), as an alternative sanitizer for the disinfection of citrus fruit in packinghouses. Tests in vitro and in vivo were carried out to determine the cell inhibitory concentration and to verify the efficacy of the oil for the disinfection of citrus fruits. In in vitro tests, CEO was able to inhibit X. citri when used at 0.75% (v/v). In experiments that simulate the sanitization process used in packinghouses, 5% CEO was as effective as the recommended sanitization product based on sodium hypochlorite. GC-MS results showed a high presence of eugenol derivatives as the major compounds of CEO. All results proved that CEO is a potential sanitizer that could be used as an alternative to sodium hypochlorite. Novelty impact statement. Experimental evidence shows that the clove essential oil (CEO) has the same sanitization efficacy as sodium hypochlorite, which makes of CEO an alternative sanitizer for the decontamination of citrus fruits to be exported to the European Union. CEO is a safer and more sustainable sanitizer for the postharvest disinfection of citrus fruit. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Food Research International					The aim of the present study was to assess the cultivable microbiota of "mothers" of Vino cotto collected from production of different years 1890, 1895, 1920, 1975, 2008. A total of 73 yeasts and 81 bacteria were isolated. Starmerella lactis-condensi, Starmerella bacillaris, Hanseniaspora uvarum, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Hanseniaspora guillermondi and Metschnikowia pulcherrima were identified. Bacteria isolates belonged to lactic acid bacteria (Lactiplantibacillus plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus) and acetic acid bacteria (Gluconobacter oxydans). Remarkable biodiversity was observed for Starm. Bacillaris, as well as L. plantarum and G. oxydans. Organic acids and volatile compounds were also determined. Malic and succinic acids were the main ones with values ranging from 8.49 g/L to 11.76 g/L and from 4.15 g/L to 7.73 g/L respectively, while citric acid was present at low concentrations (<0.2 g/L) in all samples. Esters and higher alcohols were the main volatile compounds detected followed by alkanes. This study permits to better understand the microbial communities associated to this product and could be considered a starting point for the definition of tailored starter cultures to improve the quality of Vino cotto preserving its typical traits.

Food Chemistry					The consumption of soy milk is increasing worldwide for its nutritional value and health benefits, however, its protein composition after commercialization is not well known. Technological and thermal treatments to which soy milk is subjected could affect the protein composition of the commercial products. This study compared the protein profile of 15 different commercial soy milks using a label-free quantitative proteomics approach. Proteins related to nutrient reservoir activity, endopeptidase inhibitor activity, lipid binding, and seed maturation contribute the most in terms of percentage mass. Their associated Gene Ontology terms are also enriched. Samples clustered into three groups based on their protein composition, with glycinins and beta-conglycinins being the most influential for determining the clustering. Amino acid composition estimated from the proteomics data also reflects the clustering of samples. Twenty allergenic proteins varying in abundance were identified, with Gly m 5 and Gly m 6 being the predominantly abundant allergens. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Italian Journal of Food Science					Drying kinetics, color properties, water-soluble vitamins, antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, and thermal degradation kinetics of bioactive compounds in goji berries were investigated. Drying experiments were conducted at 50°C, 60°C, and 70°C. Page model was determined as the best model to predict experimental moisture ratio for all temperatures. Increment in drying temperature increased effective moisture diffusivity and drying rate values. Vitamins C and B6, antioxidant activity and total phenolic content were significantly reduced by drying. Thermal degradation of vitamins C and B6, antioxidant capacity and total phenolic content were found to fit the first order kinetic model.										2021	33	1	16	28	1120-1770				10.15586/ijfs.v33i1.1949					FSTA:2021-12-Jf16233
J		Baum, C. M.; Broering, S.; Lagerkvist, C. J.							Information, attitudes, and consumer evaluations of cultivated meat.		Food Quality and Preference					Fast-moving developments for cultivated meat make it crucial to wrestle with prospective challenges and thereby lay the groundwork for a viable commercial market. Despite ample attention to issues of naming and regulation, the effect of information provision on consumer attitudes and evaluations has received less interest, even as claims (positive and negative) about cultivated meat increase in scope and complexity. Accordingly, we employed a 2x2 experimental design with information treatments varying by valence and complexity to explore if information provision influenced purchasing evaluations by way of attitudes. Using a sample of 617 German consumers, we found that whether information accentuated the risks or benefits of cultivated meat had a fundamental impact on explicit attitudes and purchasing evaluations, but not implicit attitudes. The role of complexity was however more nuanced, with an impact only on explicit attitudes and when risks were accentuated. Moreover, using mediation analysis, we revealed that implicit and explicit attitudes serially mediated the relationship between information provision and purchasing evaluations, thereby affecting the overall effectiveness of information. In sum, the findings underscore the importance of implicit and explicit attitudes (as well as food technology neophobia and prior knowledge) for evaluation processes of consumers, along with how disentangling the respective effects of valence and complexity of information enables the development of more effective and tailored messaging approaches.

Analysis of protein-network formation of different vegetable proteins during emulsification to produce solid fat substitutes.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Plant-based emulsion gels can be used as solid animal fat substitutes for vegan sausages. For this reason, commercially available protein isolates with different amino acid profiles from pea, soy and potato (Pea-1, Pea-2, Soy, Potato) have been tested for their ability to form shape stable emulsions gels at neutral pH and upon heating to 72 °C. In order to obtain emulsion gels that are as solid as possible, the protein concentrations in the continuous phase (CPC, 8.0-11.5% (w/w)) and the oil mass fractions (65-80%) were varied. For leguminous proteins, a positive correlation of both parameters on emulsion rigidity was shown, indicating that both, interfacial and protein-protein interactions, are involved in structure reinforcement. Firmness increased with increasing content in cysteine (Pea-1PC and oil content). The emulsions showed a much higher degree in crosslinking, and very low charge density. Temperature-sweep analysis and CLSM revealed that Potato protein gelled as consequence to low temperature stability. Hence, the structure reinforcement in Potato emulsions mainly contributed to the protein network, with 70% oil and CPC 11.5% forming a hybrid gel with highest firmness. However, gelling of Potato protein also resulted in interfacial adsorption of protein aggregates and reduced interfacial stability with increasing CPC. This was demonstrated in the amount of extractable fat which was 2.0 and 0.6% for Pea-1 and 2 emulsions, 6.4% for Soy and 34.4% of total fat for Potato emulsions. ©The Author(s) 2021.

Biosynthesis of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potato leaves (Solanum tuberosum L.)-a13CO2 study.		Food Chemistry					alpha-Solanine and alpha-chaconine are the major glycoalkaloids (SGAs) in potatoes, but up to now the biosynthesis of these saponins is not fully understood. In planta13CO2 labeling experiments monitored by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) unraveled the SGA biosynthetic pathways from CO2 photosynthates via early precursors to the SGAs. After a pulse of ~ 700 ppm13CO2 for four hours, followed by a chase period for seven days, specific13C-distributions were detected in SGAs from the leaves of the labeled plant. NMR analysis determined the positional13C-enrichments in alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine characterized by13C2-pairs in their aglycones. These patterns were in perfect agreement with a mevalonate-dependent biosynthesis of the isopentenyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate precursors. The13C-distributions also suggested cyclization of the 2,3-oxidosqualene precursor into the solanidine aglycone backbone involving a non-stereoselective hydroxylation step of the sterol a mixture of 25 S-/25 R-epimers of the SGAs.

D. la							Claw disorders as iceberg indicators of cattle welfare: evidence-based on production system, severity, and associations with final muscle pH.		Meat Science					This study presents a novel approach to use claw disorders in cattle as a retrospective welfare indicator characterized at the abattoir. A total of 1040 cattle (2080 front and back left claws) were analyzed from 143 batches, originating from feedlots, free-range, and dairy systems. Our results indicate that abnormal claw shapes (>55%) and fissures of the claw wall (>25%) had the highest prevalence, regardless of the system of origin. For the seven types of lesions monitored, numerous associations were found between lesions in the front and rear limbs typical of each production system. Ultimate meat pH was higher in animals with white line disease and skin wounds in feedlot and free-range cattle. We conclude that claw disorders can be used as an iceberg indicator to provide valuable information about animal fitness, and the ability to cope with the husbandry and pre-slaughter environment. These indicators can be used to improve the level of welfare of the animals.

J		Bauw, M. de; Matthys, C.; Poppe, V.; Franssens, S.; Vranken, L.							A combined Nutri-Score and "Eco-Score" approach for more nutritious and more environmentally friendly food choices? Evidence from a consumer experiment in Belgium.		Food Quality and Preference					The application of Nutri-Score on food products is ubiquitous throughout Europe and studies demonstrating its potential to stimulate healthier food choices are accumulating. At the same time, a strong need exists to evenly harmonize and activate the communication of environmental impacts on food products, in synergy with the Nutri-Score. This raises the question of whether the Nutri-Score could be expanded to an "Eco-Score" that would similarly encourage environmentally friendly food choices. This paper reports a randomized control trial, in which a representative sample of 805 Belgian consumers was asked to hypothetically buy ingredients for a meal in a small-scale mock-up E-grocery environment. The experiment tested whether a combined Nutri-Score and Eco-Score affected the nutritional quality and environmental impact of consumers' food choices. This effect was compared to general and specific dietary recommendations on the one hand, and to detailed impact tables on the other hand. Since visual distraction often plays a role in informative persuasion, the treatments were evaluated subject to different levels of distraction caused by product images. The average nutritional quality index (NQI) and environmental impact index (EII) of the selected baskets were calculated to evaluate the effects of the manipulations. We find that a joint Nutri-Score and Eco-Score label improves the NQI but not the EII. The general-and specific recommendation as well as the detailed information also improved the NQI. However, the specific recommendation was the only treatment that also improved the EII. The improvements in NQI due to the scores could be explained by a reduced consumption of pork. The improvements in EII induced by the specific recommendation could mainly be explained by a reduction in beef consumption. Only very mild indications were found that product images interfered with the effect of the scores. This study provides some initial evidence and support for the use of dual Nutri-Score-Eco-Score label to induce transitions towards healthier and more sustainable diets. We also find that recommendations outside the classic Front-Of-Package label framework could be a promising way to realize such a transition. However, it remains to be tested whether similar effects occur in real E-groceries and on a longer time scale.

Weissella cibaria short-fermented liquid sourdoughs based on quinoa or amaranth flours as fat replacer in focaccia bread formulation.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Production of the traditional Italian Focaccia bread (FcBread) requires reformulation to meet the new rules for healthier foods. We tested the applicability of a short-fermented (15 h) liquid sourdough (LS) (dough yield, DY, 250), obtained using quinoa (Q) or amaranth (Am) flour fermented with a Weissella cibaria strain (C43-11) producing exopolysaccharides (EPS) as fat replacer in yeast-leavened FcBread. The LSs were applied during the FcBread-making process at industrial pilot plant, reducing the added fat amount by 20% (FcBread-QLS and FcBread-AmLS) and products were compared with reference samples not containing EPS. All the products were analysed for physico-chemical properties (pH, TTA, organic acids, protein content and profile, instrumental colour), textural properties, sensory quality and glycemic index. The application of both pseudo-cereal-based W. cibaria LSs in FcBread allowed obtaining products with a reduced amount of fat, increased protein amount, mainly due to the albumin and glutenin/glutelin fractions, reduced glycemic index, improved texture and preserved in the traditional sensory profile of "focaccia". © 2020 Institute of Food Science and Technology.										2021	56	7	3197	3208	0950-5423				10.1111/ijfs.14874					FSTA:2021-10-Mn6418

Thermal or membrane processing for Infant Milk Formula: effects on protein digestion and integrity of the intestinal barrier.		Food Chemistry					Infant Milk Formula (IMF) is designed as a breastmilk substitute to satisfy the nutritional requirements during the first months of life. This study investigates the effects of two IMF processing technologies on cow milk protein digestion using an infant static in vitro gastrointestinal model. The degree of protein hydrolysis at the end of the gastric phase was 3.7-fold higher for IMF produced by high temperature (IMF-HT), compared to IMF produced by cascade membrane filtration (IMF-CMF), as assessed by free N-terminal group analysis. The processing type also influenced the panel of bioavailable peptides detected in basolateral compartments of Caco-2 monolayers exposed to gastrointestinal digested IMFs. In addition, IMF-CMF significantly increased tight junction protein, claudin 1, whilst IMF-HT significantly reduced tight junction integrity. In conclusion, producing IMF by CMF may preserve intestinal barrier integrity and can deliver its own unique inventory of bioavailable peptides with potential bioactivity.

Development of an Arabic food composition database for use in an Arabic online dietary assessment tool (myfood24).		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					A comprehensive food composition database (FCDB) is essential for assessing dietary intake of nutrients. However, currently available food composition data for Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) is limited. The aim was to develop an Arabic FCDB of foods commonly available in the GCC (initial focus on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait), which will be integrated into an Arabic version of an online dietary assessment tool, myfood24. The Arabic FCDB was built using a standardized approach identifying currently available foods from existing food composition tables (FCTs), research articles, back-of-pack (BOP) nutrient labels on food products, with additional generic food items from the UK Composition of Foods Integrated Database (CoFID). The development of the FCDB used a 6-step approach: food identification, cleaning, mapping, translation, allocating portion sizes, and quality checking. The database includes a total of 2016 food items, 30% of which have standard portion size images in addition to other options for portion size estimation. The database and myfood24 have been translated into Arabic to be suitable for Arabic users. These tools will help to assess dietary intake for 51 million people in the GCC. Future work will cover more foods from other Middle Eastern countries to serve over 400 million Arabic speakers in the region. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Tahini consumption improves metabolic and antioxidant status biomarkers in the postprandial state in healthy males.		European Food Research and Technology					Sesame seeds (Sesamum indicum L.) are rich in unsaturated fats, and also contain tocopherols and lignans (sesamin, sesamolin and sesamol), which may exhibit antioxidant properties. Sesame paste, or tahini, a semi-solid product of sesame, has not been examined in detail. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of tahini consumption on oxidative stress and cardiovascular risk indices in healthy men. Twenty healthy men with mean age of 28 years and mean BMI of 25.81 kg/m2 were included in the study. After a 12 h fast, baseline blood and urine samples were collected. After consumption of 50 g of tahini, blood and urine samples were collected at 1, 2, 3 and 4 h postprandially. Serum or plasma samples were used for the measurement of glucose, triglycerides, total phenolic content and ferric-reducing ability of plasma (FRAP), while levels of 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a were measured in urine samples. Plasma glucose was significantly lower at 1, 3 and 4 h after tahini consumption compared to baseline (p<0.05). A trend of increase in total phenolic content (p=0.092) was observed 4 h postprandially. Alongside, significant increases in both serum triglyceride (p<0.001) and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2a levels (p=0.016) were reported at the end of the trial. No differences were reported in FRAP postprandially compared to baseline. Consumption of 50 g of tahini, either as part of a healthy breakfast or by replacing snacks with a less desirable lipid profile, could be a good practice for modern consumers. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	11	2721	2728	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03828-5					FSTA:2022-01-Js0598

Water activity, moisture content, color, textural, sensory, melting, and flow behavior properties of the samples were determined. Total phenolic compounds and antioxidant capacity of samples were determined before and after in vitro digestion. Moisture content, particle size, hardness, a*, h°, yield stress, plastic viscosity values increased in compound chocolate samples significantly (p<.05). Particle size, a*, and h° values increased in spread samples, but no significant effect on sensory properties was determined. BCE in compound chocolate caused a decrease in the sensory parameters. The bioaccessibility values for total phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity in both groups were determined as 125.5%-244.4% and 118.6%-255.8%, respectively. These values show BCE may be an important phenolic delivering agent without any intolerable quality character change. Novelty impact statement. Black carrot extract (BCE) powder was used as a coloring agent and anthocyanin source. This study is the first study using BCE powder in the spread (SC) and compound chocolate (CC).

J		Bayer, S.; Mayer, A. I.; Borgonovo, G.; Morini, G.; Pizio, A. di; Bassoli, A.							Chemoinformatics view on bitter taste receptor agonists in food.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					Food compounds with a bitter taste have a role in human health, both for their capability to influence food choice and preferences and for their possible systemic effect due to the modulation of extra-oral bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs). Investigating the interaction of bitter food compounds with TAS2Rs is a key step to unravel their complex effects on health and to pave the way to rationally design new additives for food formulation or drugs. Here, we propose a collection of food bitter compounds, for which in vitro activity data against TAS2Rs are available. The patterns of TAS2R subtype-specific agonists were analyzed using scaffold decomposition and chemical space analysis, providing a detailed characterization of the associations between food bitter tastants and TAS2Rs.

J		Baykus, G.; Akgun, M. P.; Unluturk, S.							Effects of ultraviolet-light emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) on microbial inactivation and quality attributes of mixed beverage made from blend of carrot, carob, ginger, grape and lemon juice.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Efficacy of ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) with peak and coupled emissions at 280,365 and 280/365nm on inactivation of E. coli K12 in mixed beverage (MB) was investigated. MB comprised of 31.6% carrot, 44.3% carob, 8.7% grape, 10.2% ginger, and 5.2% lemon juice. The impact of UV-LEDs on some physicochemical and phytochemical properties of MB was compared to that of heat treatment (70 °C, 120s). While, UV-LED irradiation using coupled 280/365nm for 40min resulted in the highest inactivation of E. coli K12 (>4 log) out of tested wavelengths, the number of mesophilic bacteria (TAC), and yeast and molds (YM) in mixed beverage were reduced by 2.59 log CFU/mL (from 5.69 log CFU/mL of initial load), and 0.17 log CFU/mL (from 3.28 log CFU/mL of the initial load), respectively. Although, the color parameters slightly changed after irradiation, the color of MB did not show visual difference (DeltaE=0.94) compared to untreated samples. UV-LED treatment caused a significant increase in total phenolic compound (1.75-fold) and antioxidant capacity (4.60 fold) compared to heat-treated samples (p<0.05). UV-LED treatment caused a decrease in carotenoid content (71.3%) lower than that of heat-treated samples (88.9%), indicating that UV-LED irradiation preserved the total carotenoid content better than the heat treatment. Industrial relevance Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are new sources of ultraviolet light utilized for non-thermal processing of foods. In this study, a static bench top unit was designed to investigate the efficacy of UV-LEDs with different treatment times and peak emissions by considering the inactivation of E. coli K12 in newly formulated mixed drink (MB). UV-LED irradiation of MB using coupled 280/365nm for 40min provided the highest microbial inactivation and preserved bioactive compounds better than the heat treatment. It can be proposed as an effective method for the processing of fruit juices which is rich in bioactive constituents. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Traditional processing, physicochemical property, phytochemical content, and microbiological and sensory quality of the yellow "Tea Lemi" wine made in the Far-North of cameroon.		Journal of Food Quality					"Tea Lemi" is a traditional wine made from pummelos by the Kapsiki in the Far-North of Cameroon. Despite its importance as a source of income for the country people, the know-how supporting production of this beverage and its quality attributes still remain unknown. Hence, this study was aimed at describing the processing and quality of "Tea Lemi" produced and marketed in northern Cameroon. The field investigation and the ethnographical technique were used to describe the production process. Physicochemical, phytochemical, and microbiological properties of the beverage were examined using referenced techniques. Quantitative descriptive analysis was used for describing the sensory profile of the wine. Surveys showed that processing of the grapefruit wine is typically artisanal. This can be seen by the uncontrolled addition of some ingredients such as sugar, extract of banana, and honey and a significant fermentation step started by wild, unselected yeasts. The physicochemical analyses revealed that the wine had an acid pH of around 3.84, with a total acidity between 7.72 g/L and 8.79 g/L. The alcohol and soluble solids contents were 14% (v/v) and 12 °Brix, respectively. Total sugar and conductivity values ranged from 57.8 to 96.8 g/L and 573 to 686 muS/cm. Mean contents of polyphenols and flavonoids of 616.4 mg PE/L and 322.5 mg QE/L and an antioxidant capacity of 261.03 mg TE/L have been revealed in the indigenous wine, respectively. The assessment of hygienic quality showed alarming sign of microbiological contamination revealed by total aerobic bacteria and spore-forming bacteria counts beyond the critical level. The good sensory quality (13 out of 20) of the grapefruit wine seemed to be linked to the sweetness (r=0.999; p<0.001) and odor/flavor (r=0.997;p<0.001). The beverage has been described by the panel as pale yellow colored, slightly tart, and bitter accompanied by some fruity esters and sweet notes of citrus and caramelized sugar.

J		Bayraktar, O.; Yahsi, Y.; Kose, M. D.							Electroencapsulation of trans-resveratrol in nanoparticles composed of silk fibroin and soluble eggshell membrane protein.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					The beneficial effects of trans-resveratrol on health are widely accepted. However, when exposed to heat and UV light, the degradation of trans-resveratrol to less active form cis-resveratrol limits its use in industrial applications. Due to this reason, it is crucial to preserve the stability of trans-resveratrol by using carrier systems. This study aimed to encapsulate the trans-resveratrol in core/shell nanoparticles composed of eggshell membrane proteins and silk fibroin, respectively, using a coaxial electrospraying technique to preserve its stability. The size of the nanoparticles ranged from 8.2 to 254 nm. Keeping the encapsulation yield at the maximum level (96.9%), electroencapsulation process parameters which minimize the average particle diameter (23.8 nm) were found to be A (silk fibroin concentration) =30.7 mg/ml, B (ratio of flow rates) =0.72, C (applied voltage)=18.8 kV, and D (distance) =12.2 cm. Encapsulation efficiency varied between 40.05 and 96.41%. Detection of antioxidant capacity of released trans-resveratrol suggested that nanoparticles could be a suitable delivery system for sustained release of trans-resveratrol with preserved thermal and UV photostability. Central composite design (CCD) and the response surface methodology (RSM) were successfully used to optimize the electroencapsulation process parameters for the preparation of trans-resveratrol loaded core/shell nanoparticles. It was found that these parameters seemed to be varied depending on the response required. Therefore, an optimum process should be investigated to obtain desired responses such as high encapsulation yield, high encapsulation efficiency, and small average particle size while preserving the thermal and UV stabilities at reasonable levels. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.

Utilization of eggshell membrane and olive leaf extract for the preparation of functional materials.		Foods					Eggshell membrane (ESM) is a natural proteinaceous by-product of the food industry, especially in the pasteurized egg industry, resulting in the availability of much discarded egg waste. In the literature, eggshell (ES) and ESM usage for their adsorbent properties to remove various organic and inorganic hazardous chemicals, especially from wastewater, has gained interest. In addition, agricultural (olive leaf) and food industry (eggshell and eggshell membrane) waste can together be valorized to produce value-added functional products. This study's objective was to evaluate the eggshell membrane's loading capacity for bioactive compounds obtained from olive leaf extract (OLE) in order to prepare functional biomaterial. In this study, waste eggshell membranes were used to adsorb the phenolic compounds from olive leaf extract to design functional biomaterials. Using the foam separation method, both separation of the eggshell membrane and adsorption of bioactive compounds to the eggshell membrane were achieved simultaneously. The characterization studies showed that OLE was successfully adsorbed to the eggshell membrane. Cytotoxicity and antimicrobial studies showed that prepared OLE-loaded membranes were functional materials with bioactive properties. In conclusion, ESM was determined as a promising protein in the production of functional antioxidative and antimicrobial food or dietary supplement after the adsorption of bioactive olive leaf polyphenols. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bayram, H. M.; Ozturkcan, A.							The presence of sodium content and sodium-containing food additives in packaged foods and beverages sold in Turkey.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Excess sodium (Na) intake is a significant leading cause of the development of non-communicable diseases. However, there is no scientific evidence on Na content (and its variation) in packaged products sold in Turkey. This study aimed to determine Na levels and Na-containing food additives of packaged products that are available in supermarkets across Turkey in 2020 in addition to evaluating the proportion of foods that comply with the World Health Organization global Na benchmark targets (2021). Of the 2975 packaged products analyzed, 60.3 % of products contained salt and 53.5 % of them contained a Na-containing food additive. A total of 31.8 % of products were classified as having a high Na content and the highest median Na levels were among the soy sauces and fish sauce group (4280 mg/100 g or ml); followed by olive group (2160 mg/100 g or ml), and soft to medium ripened cheese group (1880 mg/100 g or ml). The most used Na-containing food additive was sodium carboxymethyl cellulose. New regulations can be developed for the reformulation of packaged products containing high Na content and the progress of reducing Na intake of the population and improved health outcomes can be monitored over time.

J		Bayram, N. E.							Vitamin, mineral, polyphenol, amino acid profile of bee pollen from Rhododendron ponticum (source of "mad honey"): nutritional and palynological approach.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					In this study, it was aimed to characterize the pollen collected by bees from the Rhododenron ponticum plant, which is the source of mad honey, in terms of some parameters. In the first stage, the botanical origin of the sample was confirmed by palynological analysis supported by light microscopic images. Then, the chemical profile of Rhododenron ponticum bee pollen was examined in terms of 31 elements, 42 amino acids, 33 phenolics and vitamins A, B1, B2, B5, B6, B7, B12, C, E, K1 and K2. The total individual phenolic compound content of Rhododendron ponticum bee pollen was determined as 11928.23g/100 g, total element content as 13997.75mg/kg, total free amino acid content as 149466.11g/g and total vitamin content as 20509.37g/100 g. In addition, it was characterized by a low content of vitamin A (retinol), B7, B12, K2, as well as a deficiency of vitamin K1. As a result of analysis with LC-MS-MS, it was found that it contains L-asparagine and myricetin in a significantly higher concentration compared to other amino acids and phenolic compounds. However, the presence of phenolic compounds (myricetin, epicatechin, tyrosol etc.) and amino acids (L-asparagine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, L-Tryptophan etc.) with significant biological activity indicates that this product is a bee product with high medicinal properties. Moreover, the significant presence of Mg, P, Fe and Ca, high K/Na ratio, vitamin C, B2, B5 and B6 content makes bee pollen collected from Rhododendron ponticum plant attractive for diets. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	15	3	2659	2666	2193-4134				10.1007/s11694-021-00854-5					FSTA:2021-11-Lg1835
J		Bayramoglu, G.; Arica, M. Y.							Strong and weak cation-exchange groups generated cryogels films for adsorption and purification of lysozyme from chicken egg white.		Food Chemistry					Here, the macroporous poly(hydroxylmethyl methacrylate/glycidyl methacrylate [p(HEMA-GMA)]) cryogels with large porous surface were prepared, and then the epoxy groups of the p(HEMA-GMA) cryogels were systematically modified into strong and weak cationic groups. The effects of initial protein concentrations, adsorption time, pH, salt concentrations and temperatures on adsorption efficiency of cation exchange cryogels for lysozyme were determined. The maximum lysozyme adsorption capacities of strong and weak cation exchange cryogels were found to be 188.3 and 79.7 mg/g cryogel at 25 °C, respectively. The performance of the strong cationic cryogel was evaluated by purification of lysozyme from egg white. The activity of the isolated lysozyme was found to be 21,347 U/mg. The cationic cryogel maintained its expected high adsorption capacity and efficiency of the purification levels during repeated adsorption desorption processes. Finally, the purpose of this work is the design a cation exchange system for purification of lysozyme from egg-white. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Smartphone application for total phenols content and antioxidant determination in tomato, strawberry, and coffee employing digital imaging.		Food Analytical Methods					A low-cost, simple method for in situ determination of total phenols and antioxidants in tomato, strawberry, and coffee through digital imaging was developed and validated. The determination of total phenolic was based on the chelation reaction between quercetin and ferric chloride forming a yellow complex. The antioxidants were quantified by the reaction between 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, potassium ferricyanide, and ferric chloride, forming a bluish-green complex. After optimization, analytical curves were built to monitor the green color channel within the concentration range of 0 to 31.8 mg L-1 (r=0.9969) and of 0 to 5 mg L-1 (r=0.9995) for quercetin and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol, respectively. The recovery of quercetin and 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol ranged from 96.48 to 101.11% and from 99.00 to 106.00%, respectively. Limits of detection and quantification were 0.03 and 0.11 for quercetin and 0.26 and 0.88 mg L-1 for 2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol. The proposed method affords simple manipulation, fast response and environmental safety. Graphical ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Foods					This article describes the use of Chlorella sorokiniana biomass additives in pasta recipes to enrich the product with biologically active phytonutrients, as well as to achieve the desired color range without the use of synthetic dyes. Samples of dry biomass were obtained by the cultivation of microalgae C. sorokiniana (strain), its quality indicators and nutritional value were determined for use as a food additive. A method of using dry biomass of microalgae C. sorokiniana as a phytoadditive to replace 5% of flour mixture for effective enrichment of pasta with biologically active phytonutrients was proposed. The choice of the optimal amount of addition of microalgae biomass was proved since it turned out that the replacement of flour should be no more than 5% due to the distinct fish flavor of the final product. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of adding dry biomass of Chlorella microalgae on total protein, lipid, chlorophyll, and carotenoid content. Substitution of 5% of pasta flour led to an increase in the content of proteins and lipids to 15.7 0.50% and 4.1 0.06%, respectively. Meanwhile, the addition of microalgae Chlorella to pasta has helped to increase the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids, chlorophyll, and carotenoids which are necessary for the prevention of foodborne diseases. The aim of this study is to develop pasta recipe with additives of microalgae biomass C. sorokiniana and study their quality indicators. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

R.; Zameer Hussain, S.; Tashooq Bhat; Nageena Nazir							Development of instant phirni mix (a traditional dairy dessert) from high amylose rice, skim milk powder and carboxymethyl cellulose-resistant starch, predicted glycemic index and stability during storage.		Food Bioscience					High amylose rice (HAR) and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) are ideal choices to enhance the resistant starch and reduce the glycemic index of dairy desserts. Therefore, the effect of ingredient composition (i.e., skim milk powder: high amylose rice flour-SMP: HAR, and carboxymethyl cellulose-CMC) on physical characteristics of phirni dry mix were investigated in the present study. Variation in SMP: HAR flour and CMC concentration significantly (p < 0.05) affected the insolubility index, wettability, Hausner ratio, luminosity (L*), and yellowness (b*) of different phirni dry Mix samples. Design expert predicted SMP (70%), HAR (30%) and CMC concentration of 0.85% as desirable conditions for preparation of phirni dry mix. A typical A-type diffraction pattern and absorption bands representative of proteins, lactose and starch were detected in optimized phirni dry-mix (OPDM). Irrespective of packaging material and storage condition, resistant starch (RS) increased significantly (p < 0.05) while predicted glycemic index (pGI) showed significant (p < 0.05) decrease during storage. However, maximum RS content (7.57%) and minimum pGI (44.95) were recorded in LDPE packed samples (LDPE-PS) on 90th day of storage under accelerated conditions. At the same time, moisture content, water activity, free fatty acids, and peroxide value increased significantly (p < 0.05), while overall acceptability showed a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in LDPE-PS. The inference drawn from the present study was that irrespective of packaging material and storage condition, the OPDM was safe to consume up to 90 days, however, aluminum laminated package and ambient storage condition could be better options to retain the quality of OPDM with better consumer acceptability.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					In this study, we aimed to formulate low glycemic index gluten-free cookies from high amylose rice flour by modifying baking conditions and ingredient composition. Baking temperature, baking time, and concentration of carboxymethyl cellulose were varied between 170 and 190 °C, 12-25 min, and 0.2-1%, respectively, using central composite rotatable design. Among the physical quality attributes, spread ratio and hardness of cookies increased predominantly with the increase in baking temperature. Resistant starch content and overall acceptability of cookies increased prominently, whereas predicted glycemic index and glycemic load decreased with the increase in the concentration of carboxymethyl cellulose. Design expert predicted baking temperature of 185 °C, baking time of 22 min, and 0.8% concentration of carboxymethyl cellulose as desirable conditions for the development of gluten-free low-glycemic index cookies from rice flour. Dietary fiber content of developed cookies was recorded as 4.66%. In-vitro starch digestibility results confirmed that resistant starch increased from 2.85% in rice flour to 7.20% in cookies, whereas predicted glycemic index and glycemic load decreased from 50.12 to 30.07 in rice flour to 44.60 to 17.51 in cookies, respectively. Overall acceptability of cookies was recorded as 8.90 on a 9-point hedonic scale. All rights reserved, Elsevier.										2021	141				0023-6438				10.1016/j.lwt.2021.110885					FSTA:2021-07-Mq3980

Journal of Cereal Science					Zein is the major prolamin storage protein of maize and isolated zein is one of only two prolamins available commercially. Zein has a long history of use in the production of a wide range of materials including films, coatings, and fibers. Zein also has the unique ability to form viscoelastic dough with wheat-like properties when mixed with water under appropriate conditions. The ability to form such dough provides zein with the potential to be used in the production of baked food products for the gluten-free industry, in portions of the world where producing wheat is difficult or importing wheat is expensive, and in novel applications for plant-based foods in general. This article discusses factors that impact zein viscoelastic dough formation including the role of protein secondary structure, methods for improving zein dough formation as well as the production of breads and noodles from zein viscoelastic dough.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Black truffle (Tuber aestivumVittad.) is one of the most appreciated and one of the most expensive European truffles. The intention of our study was to create a truffle-based product (truffles, extra virgin olive oil, rosemary, red paprika, cayenne pepper) by bioguded design-a novel strategy aimed to find right mixtures of ingredients to achieve enhanced biological activity of final product. Ingredients and their combinations in different ratios were evaluated in several in vitrobioassays related to antioxidant (DPPH., NO.scavenging activity, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, reducing power-FRAP assay) and some metabolic syndrome-associated enzymes (alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, pancreatic lipase) inhibitory activity. Concentration-dependent synergy/antagonism of ingredients was noticed. For the first time, it was determined that black truffles have alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase and pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity (IC50=0.49,8.54 and 1.21 mg/mL, respectively). Dominant phenolic acids in preferable combination were rosmarinic and ursolic (2.83 and 3.48 mg/g dw, respectively), while luteolin, apigenin and chrysoeriol (55.72,22.56 and 30.75 mug/g dw, respectively) were the most abundant flavonoids. Considerable contents of proteins (405.44 mg BSAE/g dw) and polysaccharides (1.05 mmol GE/g dw) contributed to the nutritional value of final product. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

For this, an online survey and experiment with consumers was conducted (N=260). While food disgust sensitivity works as a barrier, social norms and culinary-based drivers increase people's willingness to engage with animal by-products. To expand consumer interest, measures could focus on increasing familiarity and reducing negative expectations regarding the sensory qualities of the product. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Methylparaben was the most abundant paraben with an average total concentration in the two sampling points 1.02 and 1.52 ng mL-1, respectively. Bisphenol A was the most abundant bisphenol with an average total concentration in the two sampling points 1.91 and 1.41 ng mL-1, respectively. For the first time, the hazard quotients were calculated for these compounds in the breast milk samples demonstrating that bisphenol A contributed the most to the hazard caused by the tested compounds. However, the hazard index calculated for the cumulative impact indicates that the milk samples were safe for the children.

J		Beaubier, S.; Albe-Slabi, S.; Aymes, A.; Bianeis, M.; Galet, O.; Kapel, R.							A rational approach for the production of highly soluble and functional sunflower protein hydrolysates.		Foods					Exploitation of plant proteins as an alternative to animal proteins currently presents an important challenge for food industries. In this contribution, total sunflower protein isolate from cold press meal was used as a starting material for the generation of highly soluble and functional hydrolysates that could be used in various food formulations. To do this, a rational and complete approach of controlled hydrolysis was implemented using the individual Alcalase and Prolyve enzymes. The method of stopping the hydrolysis reaction was also evaluated. The influence of operating conditions on hydrolysis kinetics and enzymatic mechanism was studied to identify the appropriate hydrolysis conditions. The gain of the solubility was then analyzed and compared to that of the initial proteins. Finally, the emulsifying and foaming properties (capacities and stabilities) of the resulting hydrolysates were also assessed. As a result, controlled enzymatic proteolysis significantly improved the sunflower protein solubility at neutral pH (twofold increase) and generated highly soluble hydrolysates. The limited proteolysis also maintained the good foam capacities and allowed an improvement in the initial foam stabilities and emulsifying capacities and stabilities of sunflower proteins. This contribution can greatly increase the value of sunflower meal and help in the development of sunflower protein products in the future. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Simultaneous determination of ochratoxin A and enterotoxin A in milk by magnetic nanoparticles based fluorescent immunoassay.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Ochratoxin A (OTA) and staphylococcus enterotoxin A (SEA) are highly toxic contaminants and have induced human health problems. They commonly occur in milk and milk products. A competitive fluorescent immunoassay was developed for rapid and simultaneous determination of these toxins in milk samples. The procedure was based on the competitive immunoreactions between antigens in sample and antigen-fluorescent dye conjugates with immobilised antibodies on magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Each monoclonal antibody specifically recognises its corresponding toxin (antigen), and there is no cross-reactivity in the assay. First, monoclonal antibodies against OTA and SEA were produced. The activity of the obtained antibodies was determined by fluorescent-linked immunosorbent assay. Then, the monoclonal antibodies were immobilised on MNPs. The amounts of immobilised anti-OTA antibody and anti-SEA antibody were determined to be 20 and 22 mug mL-1, respectively. The antigen-fluorescent dye conjugates OTA-OVA-ATTO620 and SEA-FITC were prepared. The optimal amount of immobilised antibodies for competitive immunoassay was determined. It was found that the linear range of OTA in buffer was larger (0.001-100 ng mL-1) than the linear range of SEA (0.001-20 ng mL-1). The results for simultaneous determination of OTA and SEA in sixfold diluted milk were almost the same in buffer; the linear range for OTA was from 0.005 to 100 ng mL-1 and for SEA from 0.005 to 20 ng mL-1. The detection limit for both OTA and SEA in milk was 0.004 ng mL-1. The developed method took half the time of the individual assays (20 min). The assay was evaluated using spiked milk samples. The influences of somatic cell count, fat, pH and protein concentration in milk on immunoassay were studied. In summary, this developed immunoassay could provide an effective and rapid approach for detecting multi-toxins in milk samples. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

Fluorescent immunoassay for determination of staphylococcal enterotoxin A in milk by immobilized F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-enterotoxin A monoclonal antibody.		Food Analytical Methods					Foods with high protein content such as milk, meat and salads have been frequently incriminated in staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) outbreaks. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is most toxic from all 20 SE. Potency of SEA requires that the methods of analysis in food must be sensitive enough to measure very low concentrations. A fluorescent immunoassay, sandwich format, for SEA detection in milk was developed, using immobilized F(ab′)2 fragment and anti-SEA monoclonal antibody (mAb) bonded onto the surface of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). F(ab′)2 fragment of anti-SEA mAb was obtained by pepsin hydrolysis of mAb. The fragment and antibody were conjugated with fluorescein 5 (6)-isothiocyanate (FITC) and formed F(ab′)2 fragment-FITC and mAb-FITC conjugates. The obtained conjugates were purified by Sephadex 25 size exclusion chromatography. A fluorescent immunoassay was developed by using immobilized F(ab')2 fragment and anti-SEA mAb and were obtained conjugates F(ab′)2 fragment-FITC and mAb-FITC. The analytical parameters of the immunoassay with F(ab′)2 fragment were compared with those obtained from the immunoassay with mAb. When using a immobilized F(ab′)2 and fluorescent conjugate F(ab')2 fragment-FITC, the linear range of SEA in buffer was from 0.7 to 300 pg/mL, and in milk from 1.0 to 300 pg/mL. With an immobilized mAb and mAb-FITC conjugate, the linear range of SEA in buffer and in milk was from 50 to 300 pg/mL. It was found that the immunoassay with F(ab′)2 fragment allow the measurement of SEA at very low concentrations. The limit detection of SEA in milk samples with F(ab')2 fragment was 0.9 pg/mL and with whole antibody 30 pg/mL. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

Meat Science					Carnauba wax was used in salt encapsulation, allowing sodium reduction in fresh sausages while maintaining the salty taste due to the inhomogeneous salt distribution. Four treatments were made, as follows: treatment C containing 2% non-encapsulated salt, and the treatments S2.0%, S1.5%, and S1.0% containing 2, 1.5, and 1% encapsulated salt, respectively. The physicochemical parameters were within the standard regulations for all treatments, with the lower hardness and cohesiveness observed for S1.0%. The treatments and the storage period (90 days) had no effect on aw and instrumental color. Although a decrease in pH and an increase in lipid oxidation were observed during storage, the results were within acceptable levels. Concerning the consumers' perception of saltiness, the assessors reported no differences among the treatments C, S2.0%, and S1.5%. Thus, it is possible to reduce 25% salt in fresh sausages using the taste contrast technology. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Becker, C. A.; Aghalari, A.; Marufuzzaman, M.; Stone, A. E.							Predicting dairy cattle heat stress using machine learning techniques.		Journal of Dairy Science					The objectives of the study were to use a heat stress scoring system to evaluate the severity of heat stress on dairy cows using different heat abatement techniques. The scoring system ranged from 1 to 4, where 1=no heat stress; 2=mild heat stress; 3=severe heat stress; and 4=moribund. The accuracy of the scoring system was then predicted using 3 machine learning techniques: logistic regression, Gaussian naive Bayes, and random forest. To predict the accuracy of the scoring system, these techniques used factors including temperature-humidity index, respiration rate, lying time, lying bouts, total steps, drooling, open-mouth breathing, panting, location in shade or sprinklers, somatic cell score, reticulorumen temperature, hygiene body condition score, milk yield, and milk fat and protein percent. Three different treatments, namely, portable shade structure, portable polyvinyl chloride pipe sprinkler system, or control with no heat abatement, were considered, where each treatment was replicated 3 times with 3 second-trimester lactating cows. Results. Indicate that random forest outperformed the other 2 methods, with respect to both accuracy and precision, in predicting the sprinkler group's score. Both logistic regression and random forest were consistent in predicting scores for control, shade, and combined groups. The mean probability of predicting non-heat-stressed cows was highest for cows in the sprinkler group. Finally, the logistic regression method worked best for predicting heat-stressed cows in control, shade, and combined. The insights gained from these results could aid dairy producers to detect heat stress before it becomes severe, which could decrease the negative effects of heat stress, such as milk loss.

J		Becot, F.; Parker, J.; Conner, D.; Pivarnik, L.; Richard, N.; Wright-hirsch, D.							Financially able and willing to invest in food safety practices? The example of produce growers in New England states (USA).		Food Control					The 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) exempts most small-and medium-scale growers in the U.S. from the new produce safety rule that creates a set of minimum safety standards for producing and processing fresh fruits and vegetables. While the exemption may limit the financial burden of growers in the short term, growers not willing or unable to meet food safety standards could lose out on market opportunities. In this article, we draw on a primary dataset of 301 survey responses from small-and medium-scale produce growers in New England (NE) and develop a conceptual framework for analyzing both objective and subjective factors associated with the on-farm adoption of food safety practices. We begin our analysis by exploring the extent to which growers report being financially able and willing to invest in food safety practices, and continue with an assessment of factors associated with the financial ability and willingness to adopt these practices. Regarding ability, we find that 24% of growers were able to adopt practices regardless of cost, while 64% were able to invest if not cost prohibitive. The odds of being able to invest increased 4% for every one-unit increase in the food safety knowledge test score and increased 20% for every one-unit increase in the number of practices implemented. In addition, the odds were 84% lower for those who reported financial barriers to adoption compared to those who did not. With respect to willingness, 46% of growers were willing to adopt practices regardless of cost, while 49% were willing if not cost prohibitive. The odds of being willing to invest increased 4% for every one-unit increase in food safety knowledge test score, were 4.9 times more likely for those who perceived no barriers to the implementation of practices, and were 2.7 times more likely for those who perceive that growers have a role to play in food safety. We conclude with a discussion of the practical implications for technical assistance providers, policy makers, and government agencies, as well as avenues for future research. These are centered around three points: (1) the high potential for adoption of food safety practices where cost remains a limiting factor, (2) a potential disconnect between the commonly used knowledge deficit approach to food safety training and what growers want and need to know, and (3) the importance of adopting a systemic approach to understand the realities of growers and the diversity of factors that shape the adoption of food safety practices.

J		Bedane, T. F.; Erdogdu, F.; Lyng, J. G.; Marra, F.							Effects of geometry and orientation of food products on heating uniformity during radio frequency heating.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					In radio frequency (RF) assisted heat treatment of food products, heating behavior depends on the composition and geometry of a product. In this study, the effect of salt added to a food simulant on its dielectric properties and penetration depth (dp) were determined across a temperature range from 5 to 80 °C. Three primitive geometries (cube, cylinder and sphere) of a food simulant having a standardised volume (3.98*10-4 m3) heated in a custom-built 50 Omega RF system to investigate the impact of sample geometry and orientation on power absorption and heating uniformity. Experimental results revealed vertical oriented cylinder samples followed by cubes showed better temperature uniformity. The temperature at the core of food simulant samples after 6 min RF heating using 500 W power was 447.1 °C, 45.30.9 °C and 52.93.5 °C in cube, cylinder, and sphere sample, respectively. However, the sphere sample was characterized by having the hottest spot at the bottom section. RF power level also played a significant role in heating uniformity with lower power input resulting not only in a slower heating rate but also in less uniform temperature distribution. This study provided a potential insight on the use of food simulants for evaluating RF heating design and performances. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

The impact of emerging domestic and commercial electro-heating technologies on energy consumption and quality parameters of cooked beef.		Meat Science					The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of e-Cooker and moderate electric field (MEF) cooking on physical and chemical changes occurring during the cooking of meat. Beef muscle samples (38.860.08 g) were cooked in saline solution (0.5% w/w NaCl) to a target temperature of 72 °C, followed by a 2 min holding time. The experimental results revealed that e-Cooker and MEF significantly reduced the come-up time required to achieve a target temperature of 72 °C to 1.160.02 min and 0.860.02 min, respectively compared to 14.120.55 min in conventional cooking. The colour and instrumental texture of cooked meat by e-Cooker and MEF systems were not significantly different (P> 0.05) from conventionally cooked ones. Overall, the results obtained demonstrated that e-Cooker and MEF can be used to cook meat in a shorter time and reasonably low energy input while producing a product which is comparable in quality to conventionally cooked meat.

J		Bedir, T. B.; Kuleasan, H.							A natural approach, the use of killer toxin produced by Metschnikowia pulcherrima in fresh ground beef patties for shelf life extention.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					A novel killer toxin produced by yeast Metschnikowia pulcherrima was purified and added into ready to cook meatballs to enhance their microbial safety and extension of their shelf life. The agent was added into ready to cook meatballs at two different concentrations (1%-K1 and 2%-K2). The results of those two groups were compared to the control group (K0) lacking the killer toxin. Physical, chemical and microbiological analyses were carried out in meat dough and all analyses were repeated at two day intervals during 10 day-storage at +4 °C. Addition of inhibitor compound in meat dough decreased the numbers of total aerobic mesophillic bacteria, yeast and molds and lactic acid bacteria. Staphylococci/Micrococci, coliform bacteria and total psychrotrophic bacterial counts of the samples were determined as well. Results. Showed that all indicators of microbial deterioration were found to be higher in K1 group than K2 group, revealing that there was an inverse correlation between the concentration of killer toxin and the number of microorganisms causing spoilage. In addition to 1 log decrease in the number of microorganisms in toxin added groups, the high TBARS values of the control group also showed the effectiveness of the toxin. Toxic effect analysis results showed that the killer toxin had no toxic effect on L929 mouse fibroblast cells after 24h exposure.

The use of a thermal process to produce black garlic: differences in the physicochemical and sensory characteristics using seven varieties of fresh garlic.		Foods					Black garlic (BG) is a product originating from fresh garlic (FG) and substantially differs in many aspects from FG due to the process called ageing. During this thermal process, the health-promoting properties of FG are enhanced, and the sensory traits are altered. However, very little is known about how the physicochemical properties of different FG varieties affect these properties of BG. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of seven FG varieties subjected to the thermal process on the physicochemical parameters of BG. To prepare the BG samples, a fifteen-day ageing process involving a temperature gradient ranging from 30 to 82°C was used. It was found that the antioxidant activity, the total polyphenol content, and the total soluble solids increased during ageing, while the pH level, moisture content, and lightness decreased in all the garlic varieties. The varieties of garlic differed in the studied traits significantly, both before (FG) and after ageing (BG). In the sensory analysis, significant differences between the BG varieties were observed only in the pleasantness of texture, while the remaining sensory descriptors (pleasantness of color, odor, taste and intensity of the garlic aroma, and overall acceptability) were not affected by variety. The correlations suggest that most of the FG's studied parameters in this study do not correlate with the properties of BG and cannot be used for the prediction of the quality of BG. Additionally, HPLC-MS/MS analysis revealed substantial changes in the composition of low molecular compounds. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Beekman, J. K.; Popol, S.; Granvogl, M.; MacMahon, S.							Occurrence of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) esters and glycidyl esters in infant formulas from Germany.		Food Additives & Contaminants: Part A					Fatty acid esters of 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD), 2-monochloropropanediol-1,3-diol (2-MCPD), and glycidol are heat-induced processing contaminants formed during the deodorisation step of edible oil refining. Because these compounds are potentially carcinogenic and/or genotoxic, their presence in refined oils and fats and foods containing these oils/fats poses possible health concerns. In particular, formula-fed infants may be exposed to these compounds due to their presence in commercial infant formulas. For this reason, in 2018, the European Union established maximum limits for glycidyl esters in oils/fats and infant formulas and recently, as of January 2021, implemented regulations for the sum of free 3-MCPD and 3-MCPD fatty acid esters as well. This work involved the analysis of 3-MCPD and glycidyl ester contents in 45 infant formula products purchased from German supermarkets in 2019. The data produced in this study showed that average contaminant concentrations across all manufacturers were exceptionally low, with 100% of the products analysed falling below the current EU regulation for glycidyl esters in powdered formulas and 96% of the products analysed meeting the recently implemented regulation for the sum of free and bound 3-MCPD. In addition, a comparison of the 2019 data set to occurrence data collected for German formulas purchased in 2015 showed that average bound 3-MCPD and glycidol concentrations have decreased (from 0.094 to 0.054 g g-1 and from 0.010 to 0.006 g g-1, respectively), likely indicating that additional/improved mitigation measures for reducing contaminant concentrations in infant formulas have been implemented over the 4-year period. The data collected in this occurrence study are suitable for estimating levels of exposure to these compounds for German infants. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

J		Beekman, T. L.; Huck, L.; Claure, B.; Han-Seok Seo							Consumer acceptability and monetary value perception of iced coffee beverages vary with drinking conditions using different types of straws or lids.		Food Research International					A recent trend of environmental sustainability has induced many coffee providers to offer alternatives to plastic straws. There has been little research regarding consumer perception of these alternative drinking conditions. This study aimed to determine differences in consumer perception of iced coffee beverages (without ice cubes) between plastic straw and alternative drinking conditions. Brewed samples of medium roast ground coffee beans blend were cooled down and served at 5 °C in the five drinking conditions using different straw materials (plastic, paper, or stainless steel), sippy cup lid, or no lid. Seventy-five consumers rated attribute intensities and acceptances of iced coffee beverages in all five drinking conditions. The results showed that both the mean hedonic ratings of flavor, mouthfeel, or overall impression and the mean amount consumers were willing to pay (US$) for iced coffee beverages were greater in the sippy-cup lid condition than in the paper straw condition. After analyzing consumer comments of the drinking conditions, it was also found that the sippy-cup lid condition induced a more pleasant drinking experience than the paper straw condition. Notably, no significant differences between the plastic and alternative drinking conditions were observed in attribute intensity, acceptance, and monetary value perception of iced coffee beverages. In conclusion, this study shows that consumer experience and acceptability of iced coffee beverages can vary with drinking conditions. Therefore, the coffee industry and sensory professionals should consider not only sensory aspects of coffee, but also drinking conditions to improve consumer experience with coffee beverages.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Modified rice flour (MRF) with higher resistant starch content was explored to produce resistant starch, enriched extruded snacks. Effects of feed moisture (10%-35%), temperature (130-180 °C), and screw speed (150-200 rpm) on specific mechanical energy input (SME), expansion ratio (ER), breaking strength (BS), L*, a*, and b* values, resistant starch (RS), predicted glycemic index (pGI), glycemic load (GL), and sensory evaluation of extrudates were investigated. Moreover, independent variables influenced both machine and product responses significantly (p<.05). Design expert predicted feed moisture of 26.90%, temperature of 130 °C, and screw speed of 193 rpm as desirable conditions for the development of MRF extrudates. pGI decreased from 75.83 in control to 68.41 in the developed MRF extrudates. Novelty statement. Resistant starch content increased from 4.12% in native rice flour (NRF) extrudates to 7.16% in MRF extrudates. Predicted glycemic response decreased from 75.83 in NRF extrudates to 68.41 in MRF extrudates. Moisture content of 26.90%, screw speed of 193 rpm, and temperature of 130 °C were predicted as optimum extrusion cooking conditions. Using pregelatinized rice flour in the preparation of extrudates proved to be a novel way to decrease the glycemic index and glycemic load of rice-based snacks. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	11			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15953					FSTA:2022-03-Me1321
J		Beer, D. de; Preez, B. V. P. du; Joubert, E.							Development of HPLC method for quantification of phenolic compounds in Cyclopia intermedia (honeybush) herbal tea infusions.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Cyclopia intermedia is the major source material for the production of honeybush tea, specifically the "fermented" (oxidised) product. The phenolic composition of "cup-of-tea" infusions from other Cyclopia species has been reported, but such information is lacking for C. intermedia. The HPLC method previously developed for extracts of green, unoxidised C. intermedia is not suitable due to the co-elution of unidentified compounds with mangiferin and isomangiferin. A method was developed and validated to quantify the major phenolic compounds in infusions of fermented C. intermedia at "cup-of-tea" strength. Eighteen compounds were identified or tentatively identified and 14 compounds could be quantified with suitable intra-and inter-day repeatability (relative standard deviation < 8%). In a large sample set (n=96) of fermented C. intermedia, hesperidin, 3-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone and mangiferin were present at the highest concentrations (mean > 5 mg/L) in the infusions, followed by isomangiferin, vicenin-2,3-beta-D-glucopyranosyliriflophenone, neoponcirin, hesperetin and protocatechuic acid (mean > 1 mg/L). Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis showed the separation of samples into two groups mainly based on the presence (n=32) or absence (n=64) of neoponcirin. Based on information about the origin of the samples, the presence of chemotypes in different geographical areas is postulated.

Food Chemistry					The popularity of honey as a high-valued commodity is growing and consequently, honey adulteration is on the rise affecting the honey quality. The quality of the honey on the South African market was evaluated using the Agricultural Product Standards Act, 1990 as assessment tool. Various physico-chemical characteristics were tested which indicated compliance of >80% for all honey samples. A canonical variate analysis using 95% confidence regions indicates significant differences between the quality of local and imported honey with total acid, sucrose and ash as the parameters mostly distinguishing between the groups. Honey produced from agricultural crops differed significantly from all other forage types. The parameters that mostly distinguished between forage types were Lund, hydroxy-methyl-furfural and ash content.

Volatile profile of Italian and Montenegrine pomegranate juices for geographical origin classification.		European Food Research and Technology					In the present study, we have characterized for the first time the volatile fraction of 20 pomegranate juices from fruits harvested in Northern Italy and southern Montenegro, by means of headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technique (GC-MS). The volatile profile accounted for 57 compounds belonging mainly to three chemical classes: alcohols, aldehydes and terpenes. Thanks to advance chemometric analysis, the samples were clusterized according to the geographical origin, and the volatiles responsible for differentiation were identified, indicating that the use of volatile profile for discriminating between pomegranate ecotypes grown in different geographical areas is a promising approach. Overall, the chemical information acquired represents a very relevant tool for the retrieval and exploitation of minor varieties and in support of biodiversity of these promising geographical areas for pomegranate cultivation. ©Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Genomic diversity of Serratia proteamaculans and Serratia liquefaciens predominant in seafood products and spoilage potential analyses.		International Journal of Food Microbiology					Serratia sp. cause food losses and waste due to spoilage; it is noteworthy that they represent a dominant population in seafood. The main spoilage associated species comprise S. liquefaciens, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans and S. quinivorans, also known as S. liquefaciens-like strains. These species are difficult to discriminate since classical 16S rRNA gene-based sequences do not possess sufficient resolution. In this study, a phylogeny based on the short-length luxS gene was able to speciate 47 Serratia isolates from seafood, with S. proteamaculans being the main species from fresh salmon and tuna, cold-smoked salmon, and cooked shrimp while S. liquefaciens was only found in cold-smoked salmon. The genome of the first S. proteamaculans strain isolated from the seafood matrix (CD3406 strain) was sequenced. Pangenome analyses of S. proteamaculans and S. liquefaciens indicated high adaptation potential. Biosynthetic pathways involved in antimicrobial compounds production and in the main seafood spoilage compounds were also identified. The genetic equipment highlighted in this study contributed to gain further insights into the predominance of Serratia in seafood products and their capacity to spoil.

Development of antioxidant and antihypertensive properties during growth of Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus reuteri on cow's milk: fermentation and peptidomics study.		Foods					Bioactive peptides derived from milk proteins are an active research area. Exhibiting numerous positive physiological effects on digestive, cardiovascular, immune and nervous systems, these peptides thought to be one of the most promising ingredients for functional food. Generally, these peptides are inactive within the parent proteins and can be liberated during milk fermentation by the specific proteolytic systems of various Lactobacillus spp. Here we present the study of milk fermentation by Lactobacillus helveticus NK1, Lactobacillus rhamnosus F and Lactobacillus reuteri LR1 strains. It was demonstrated that the antioxidant activity of the milk fermented by these strains concomitantly increased with the strains' proteolytic activity. For the angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity, the same tendency was not observed. Although the proteolytic activity of L. helveticus NK1 was two times higher than that of L. rhamnosus F, the milk fermented by these strains showed comparable ACE inhibition. The analysis of the peptide profiles of the fermented milk samples allowed us to hypothesize that some previously unreported peptides can be produced by L. rhamnosus F. In addition, it was demonstrated that these potential ACE-inhibiting peptides originated from the C-terminus of alphaS2-casein. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Improved solid phase extraction for selective and efficient quantification of sunset yellow in different food samples using a novel molecularly imprinted polymer reinforced by Fe3O4@UiO-66-NH2.		Food Chemistry					The overuse of synthetic dyes in food products has gradually increased in recent years, resulting food safety and human health has become a global issue. An innovative design of a magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer (Fe3O4@UiO-66-NH2@MIP) for efficient, fast, and selective determination of sunset yellow (SY) from different food products was described in this study. The absorption properties of Fe3O4@UiO-66-NH2@MIP were elucidated by adsorption kinetics, isotherms, reusability, and selectivity experiments. Because of the incorporation of porous Fe3O4@UiO-66-NH2 nanocomposite into molecularly imprinted polymer an efficient nanosorbent with a short equilibrium time, a high adsorption capacity, and a good imprinting factor was finally obtained. The porous Fe3O4@UiO-66-NH2@MIP are also used for quantification of the SY. Under optimal conditions, good linearity (R2 0.9964) in the range of 1.0-120 mg L-1 and a low limit of detection (0.41 mg L-1) was observed with satisfactory recoveries (92.50-106.1%) and excellent reusability (RSD≤6.6% after 12 cycles).

J		Behnaz Shafie; Jalal Pourahmad; Mohsen Rezaei							N-acetylcysteine is more effective than ellagic acid in preventing acrolein induced dysfunction in mitochondria isolated from rat liver.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					Acrolein, a common environmental, food, and water pollutant, has been linked to the pathology of several diseases. This toxic substance is an unsaturated aldehyde and a major component of cigarette smoke and also produced during the processing of fat-containing foods. This study aimed to evaluate the protective effect of ellagic acid and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in acrolein-induced toxicity in mitochondria isolated from the rat liver. The mitochondria were exposed to different concentrations of acrolein for 40 min, then functionality was assessed. Contact with acrolein rapidly and remarkably depleted the intracellular glutathione and antioxidant capacity, because of increased ROS production and lipid peroxidation which may lead to the cell death. Mitochondria were then pre-exposed to different concentrations of ellagic acid, NAC, and IC50 concentration of acrolein. Consistent with the results, acrolein decreased GSH content and increased ROS level and lipid peroxidation, which led to ATP depletion and mitochondrial dysfunction. While ellagic acid has been able to reduce ROS and therefore the permeability of the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), presumably via its antioxidant properties, we've not detected its favorable effect on GSH and ATP restoration and also on mitochondrial complex II function. However, NAC strongly decreased ROS, lipid peroxidation and MMP and improved GSH content and complex II activity. These results showed that ellagic acid while reported to possess some cellular protective properties, did not prevent mitochondria from being affected by acrolein during this in vitro study. Practical applications. Ellagic acid is found in fruits, vegetables, and nuts which are revealed to possess strong antioxidant and protective properties. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in the pathogenesis of some chronic diseases including cancer, diabetes, liver disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, and presumably, ellagic acid by its mitochondrial protective effects can be helpful in these chronic conditions. Acrolein is an alpha, beta-unsaturated aldehyde that can be produced during cooking at high temperature. By increasing the ROS level and lipid peroxidation and depleting the glutathione content, acrolein induces cellular damage and mitochondrial toxicity. This toxicant is taken into account as a carcinogen and mutagen. In this study, the protective effect of ellagic acid in comparison with N-acetylcysteine has been investigated during the toxicity of acrolein in the rat liver mitochondria to look for evidence of whether it is useful or not through this insult. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	7			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13775					FSTA:2021-10-Aj14621
J		Behrens, M.; Huewel, S.; Galla, H. J.; Humpf, H. U.							Efflux at the blood-brain barrier reduces the cerebral exposure to ochratoxin a, ochratoxin alpha, citrinin and dihydrocitrinone.		Toxins					Recent studies have implied that environmental toxins, such as mycotoxins, are risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. To act directly as neurotoxins, mycotoxins need to penetrate or affect the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, which protects the mammalian brain from potentially harmful substances. As common food and feed contaminants of fungal origin, the interest in the potential neurotoxicity of ochratoxin A, citrinin and their metabolites has recently increased. Primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells were used to investigate cytotoxic or barrier-weakening effects of ochratoxin A, ochratoxin alpha, citrinin and dihydrocitrinone. The transfer and transport properties of the mycotoxins across the barrier formed by porcine brain capillary endothelial cell monolayers were analysed using HPLC-MS/MS. High levels of Ochratoxin A caused cytotoxic and barrier-weakening effects, whereas ochratoxin alpha, citrinin and dihydrocitrinone showed no adverse effects up to 10 M. Likely due to efflux transporter proteins, the transfer to the brain compartment was much slower than expected from their high lipophilicity. Due to their slow transfer across the blood-brain barrier, cerebral exposure of ochratoxin A, ochratoxin alpha, citrinin and dihydrocitrinone is low and neurotoxicity is likely to play a subordinate role in their toxicity at common physiological concentrations. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Behrooz Nateghpour; Gholamreza Kavoosi; Neda Mirakhorli							Amino acid profile of the peel of three citrus species and its effect on the combination of amino acids and fatty acids Chlorella vulgaris.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					Microalgae Chlorella vulgaris that is characterized by fast growth has been studied for the production of amino acid and fatty acid. Mass cultivation of C. vulgaris is necessary to achieve economically feasible production of microalgal products. In this study amino acid from lemon (Citrus limon), sweet lemon (Citrus limetta), and pomelo (Citrus maxima) peels were used as an inexpensive nutrient source for the cultivation C. vulgaris to improve fatty acid and amino acid content. The total content of amino acids were 42.3g/100g for lemon, 23.9g/100g for pomelo, and 21.9g/100g for sweet lemon. The main amino acids of the selected citrus peels were proline, serine, aspartic acid, glycine, alanine, ornithine, glutamic acid, lysine, and valine, most of which are glucogenic that contain sufficient nutrients for mixotrophic cultivation. The citrus peels' amino acids differentially increased the amount of saturated (1.5-3.6 fold), monounsaturated (1.5 fold), omega-7 monounsaturated (1.3-5.8 fold) fatty acids and non-essential amino acids (1.8-2.2 fold) in C. vulgaris. The results suggest that growth of C. vulgaris in citrus peel amino acid supplemented medium increases unsaturated fatty acid production that citrus peel has potential for use in the mass cultivation of C. vulgaris.

Food Chemistry					Osteopontin (OPN) is a multifunctional protein present in different tissues, body fluids and milk. Different milk has different level of OPN content. To determine the amount of osteopontin in bovine, buffalo, yak, sheep and goat milk, we developed an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method to detect an osteopontin signature peptide. The signature peptides selected by searching Uniprot database for trypsin digested osteopontin. The sample preparation procedure includes trypsin digestion, dimethyl labeling of tryptic peptides, purification and concentration of labeled tryptic peptide with solid phase extraction. The limit of detection and limit of quantification are 0.5 mg L-1 and 2.0 mg L-1, respectively. The method has satisfactory analytical performance with a linearity of R2≥0.998, recoveries of 103.7-111.0%, and precision of 1.8-6.2%. It is also validated and successfully applied to quantifying osteopontin content in bovine, buffalo, yak, sheep and goat milk.

Foods					Casticin has wide-ranging functional activities, but its water solubility is poor in food products. Here, a nanoemulsion stabilized by Maillard whey protein isolate conjugates (MWPI) was fabricated to encapsulate casticin. The nanoemulsion, with an average diameter of 200 nm, possessed the capability to load 700 mug/g casticin. MWPI-stabilized nanoemulsion showed better stability than that of the WPI nanoemulsion during 4 weeks of storage. Both the inhibition effects of the casticin-loaded nanoemulsion on cancer cells and the process of cellular uptake were studied. Results revealed that the casticin-loaded nanoemulsion had better inhibitory activity in HepG2 and MCF-7 cells than free casticin. Cellular uptake of the nanoemulsion displayed a time-dependent manner. After the nanoemulsion passed into HepG2 and MCF-7 cells, it would locate in the lysosome but not in the nucleus. The main pathway for the nanoemulsion to enter HepG2 cells was pinocytosis, whereas, it entered MCF-7 predominantly through the clathrin-mediated pit. This work implies that MWPI-stabilized nanoemulsions could be utilized as an effective delivery system to load casticin and have the potential to be applied in the food and pharmaceutical industries. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bei Zheng; Haina Zhang; Wei Shen; Lei Wang; Peng Chen							Core epitope analysis of 16 kDa allergen from tartary buckwheat.		Food Chemistry					Tartary buckwheat is widely accepted as its nutritional value. Some allergic reactions hinder its utilization. This research focused on evaluating the core epitope of 16 kDa allergen (Fag t 2) in tartary buckwheat. Six B-and seven T cell epitopes of Fag t 2 were predicted, and six B cell epitope-mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris. Bioinformatics analysis and SDS-PAGE demonstrated that the molecular weight, isoelectric point and spatial structures of six mutant allergens were similar with Fag t 2, with the same signal peptide sequences and alpha-amylase inhibitor domain. There was no significant change in mutants' spatial conformation confirmed by Circular Dichroism. The position K132N and peptides at 108-117 and 132-141 were the core B-and T cell epitopes of Fag t 2 confirmed by competitive inhibition ELISA and dot blot. This result was of great significance on the study of allergen epitopes in prevention and treatment of hypersensitivity.

J		Beibei Duan; Hee-Jin So; Jung-Ah Shin; Yan Qin; Jiyeon Yang; Ki-Teak Lee							Different content of cholesterol, retinol, and tocopherols in human milk according to its fat content.		European Food Research and Technology					This study aimed at investigating the different content of the selected macro-and micronutrients in human milk (HM) according to its fat content. We collected 34 HM samples from Korean mothers, and classified them into 3 groups according to their fat content. Then, their protein, lactose, cholesterol, retinol, tocopherol, and mineral contents were compared. When their contents were presented as per 100 g of HM, cholesterol, retinol, and tocopherol contents increased significantly from group A-C (p< 0.05), suggesting their positive correlation with the fat content. Alternatively, when these contents were considered as per normalized gram of HM fat content, no significant difference was observed between retinol and tocopherol contents in the three groups (p> 0.05), whereas cholesterol content was significantly lower in group C compared to A and B (p< 0.05). However, the fat content seemed to not affect the HM protein and lactose contents. Most minerals did not show statistical difference among three groups (p> 0.05). In addition, strong correlations among cholesterol, retinol, and tocopherol contents were observed, whereas these components were negatively correlated with lactose content to a small extent, and unrelated to protein content. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2021.										2021	247	5	1307	1318	1438-2377				10.1007/s00217-021-03710-4					FSTA:2021-08-Pa4108

Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) refers to liver damage caused by long-term heavy drinking, which causes oxidative stress and changes in gut microbiota. In this paper, we investigated the hepatoprotective effect of sea buckthorn fermentation liquid on ALD in mice and the interaction between ALD and gut microbiota using animal experiments and gut microbiota measurements. Results. We found that the contents of total flavonoids, total triterpenes and related short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) in sea buckthorn fermentation liquid (SFL) were significantly greater. Liver index, kidney index, spleen index, serum indexes of liver injury-alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and spartate aminotransferase (AST), inflammatory factors in liver tissues-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), oxidation indexes-malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lipid metabolism indexes-high-density liptein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride (TG), suggested that SFL significantly ameliorates liver injury caused by alcohol. By measuring gut microbiota in mice feces samples, we found that the high-dose group of SFL reversed the declining trend of the gut microbiota Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes(F/B) ratio caused by alcohol, reducing the number of gram-negative bacteroidetes. Patescibacteria was tightly connected with the indicators of ALD. At the genus level, high-dose SFL significantly downregulated Akkermansia, Turicibacter, Alistipes and Ruminiclostridium, and improved the abundance of beneficial bacteria in Lactobacillus. In addition, Alistipes and Ruminiclostridium was closely connected with the indicators of ALD. Conclusion. Sea buckthorn fermentation liquid protected against alcoholic liver disease and modulated the composition of gut microbiota. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.										2021	101	7	2846	2854	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.10915					FSTA:2021-08-Jg10160

Food Bioscience					Collagen is a potential precursor protein for Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitory peptides because of its high content of Pro. Collagen peptides with DPP-IV inhibitory activity were prepared and identified from sheep skin. The peptide sequences with the highest potential for DPP-IV inhibition were recognized by nano LS-MS/MS and in silico analysis. DPP-IV inhibitory activity of collagen peptides usually decreased after digestion, therefore the effect of peptides digestion on DPP-IV inhibitory activity were studied. Four DPP-IV inhibitory peptides resistant to digestive enzymes or having the possibility of generating new DPP-IV inhibitory peptides after digestion were synthesized. The activity of synthetic peptides before and after digestion were also studied. GPAGPIGPV was resistant to digestion and GPAGPOGFPG discharged DPP-IV inhibitory peptides in silico digestion, suggesting that they can maintain high DPP-IV inhibitory activity after digestion. Binding sites of the peptides with DPP-IV were studied by molecular docking, indicating the mechanism of the peptide having DPP-IV inhibitory activity. The results indicated that DPP-IV-inhibitory peptides identified from sheep skin collagen may be functional components in diabetic diet.

LWT -- Food Science and Technology					With advantages of long shelf life and high convenience, frozen steamed bread (FSB) is suitable for commercialization and industrialization. However, FSB has to be reheated before consumption. Since steam reheating is the most commonly used method for steamed bread reheating, the quality variation of FSB during the steam reheating process was evaluated in this research. Because of the simultaneous energy and moisture transfer, both the temperature and moisture content of reheated FSB gradually increased during steaming process. Starch gelatinization and crystallinity results showed that the retrograded starch was gelatinized again during steaming process. With the increase of steam reheating time, the increase of springiness and resilience as well as the decline of hardness and chewiness indicated the improved textural properties of steamed bread. Considering the sensory evaluation, the optimal steaming time was about 12 min with a maximum sensory evaluation score of 93.3. However, the springiness, resilience and sensory evaluation results of reheated FSB were still lower than those of the fresh steamed bread. The microstructure results showed that the damaged gluten network of FSB could not be recovered by steam reheating.

J		Beibei Zheng; Li Zhao; Xiaohan Jiang; Cherono, S.; JingJing Liu; Collins Ogutu; Charmaine Ntini; Xiujun Zhang; Yuepeng Han							Assessment of organic acid accumulation and its related genes in peach.		Food Chemistry					Fruit acidity is an important determinant of peach organoleptic quality, but its regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Measurement of organic acids in ripe fruits of seventy-five peach cultivars revealed the predominant components malate and citrate, accompanied by quinate. Organic acid accumulation increased at early stages of fruit growth, but exhibited a more dramatic reduction in low-acid cultivar during later stages of fruit development compared to high-acid cultivars. Low-acid cultivars showed citrate degradation and less transport of malate into the vacuole due to up-and down-regulation of a GABA pathway gene GAD and a malate transporter gene ALMT9, respectively. The NAD-MDH1 gene might control the rate-limiting step in malate synthesis, while three genes, PDK, PK, and ADH, could affect citrate synthesis through the pyruvate-to-acetyl-CoA-to-citrate pathway. Altogether, these results suggested that malate accumulation is controlled at the level of metabolism and vacuolar storage, while metabolism is crucial for citrate accumulation in peach.

Dynamic adsorption and interfacial rheology of whey protein isolate at oil-water interfaces: effects of protein concentration, pH and heat treatment.		Food Hydrocolloids					The effects of bulk protein concentration, Cp, (0.01, 0.1, 1 wt%), pH (3, 4.7 and 7) and heat treatment (unheated or 95 °C for 30 min) on whey protein isolate (WPI) stabilized interfaces were examined. The interfacial pressure and shear rheology of WPI-stabilized sunflower oil-water (o/w) interfaces were characterized using a pendant drop tensiometer and a rheometer equipped with a Du Nouy ring. The rate of WPI adsorption was faster at higer Cp and pH 3. Heat-enhanced surface activity was more pronounced at pH 7 compared to pH 3 as a result of greater heat stability of WPI at acidic pH. The elastic modulus of WPI stabilized interfaces increased with Cp (≤0.1 wt%). A further increase in Cp (to 1 wt%) resulted in monolayer collapse and weaker films. Non-heated (NHT) WPI formed less elastic interfacial films at pH 3 than at pH 7. Heat treatment enhanced the elastic behavior of interfacial films with longer relaxation times. This may be associated with the formation of intermolecular beta-sheets. The knowledge gained on the nature of WPI-stabilized interfaces can be used to better understand the stability of dairy emulsions during subsequent processing, digestion or storage.

Use of kinetic data to model potential antioxidant activity: radical scavenging capacity of Australian Eucalyptus honeys.		Food Chemistry					Antioxidant activity of honeys may be beneficial in wound healing processes by protecting cells against lipid oxidation. The DPPH assay assesses the efficacy of antioxidant molecules to reduce DPPH to DPPHH. Studies determining EC50 are limited by single time-point determinations of antioxidant effect and can miss vital information about the rate of antioxidant response. Acquisition of kinetic data allows determination of the radical scavenging capacity (RSC) of honeys. The purpose of this study was to determine the RSC of 53 honeys from 16 species of Australian Eucalyptus trees and four samples of New Zealand manuka (Leptospermum scoparium) honey. Whereas honeys could not be differentiated based on EC50 values, significant differences were observed for RSC, supporting collection of kinetic data for honey analysis. The greatest RSC was observed for New Zealand manuka (4.60.3*10-5 mg.mL-1.min-1), grey ironbark (E. paniculate; 3.40.2*10-5 mg.mL-1.min-1) and river red gum honeys (E. camaldulensis; 3.20.2*10-5 mg.mL-1.min-1).

Assessing mixture effects of cereulide and deoxynivalenol on intestinal barrier integrity and uptake in differentiated human Caco-2 cells.		Toxins					The human intestine is regularly exposed to ingested food contaminants, such as fungal and bacterial toxins, which have been described to co-occur in a mixed diet. Thus, it is of utmost importance to understand possible interactions between contaminants of different origin. Hence, we investigated the single and combined effects of one of the most abundant mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON; 0.1 to 10 g/mL), and the bacterial toxin cereulide (CER; 1 to 100 ng/mL) on differentiated human Caco-2 (C2BBe1) cells cultured in a transwell system. We tested the capacity of the two toxins to alter the intestinal integrity and further investigated the uptake of both compounds and the formation of selected DON metabolites. CER alone (10 and 100 ng/mL) and in combination with DON (10 ng/mL CER with 1 g/mL DON) was found to alter the barrier function by increasing the transepithelial electrical resistance and the expression of the tight junction protein claudin-4. For the first time, DON-3-sulfate was identified as a metabolite of human intestinal cells in vitro. Moreover, co-incubation of CER and DON led to an altered ratio between DON and DON-3-sulfate. Hence, we conclude that co-exposure to CER and DON may alter the intestinal barrier function and biotransformation of intestinal cells. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Bejaei, M.; Stanich, K.; Cliff, M. A.							Modelling and classification of apple textural attributes using sensory, instrumental and compositional analyses.		Foods					Textural characteristics of fruit are important for their quality, storability, and consumer acceptance. While texture can be evaluated instrumentally or sensorially, instrumental measurements are preferred if they can be reliably related to human perception. The objectives of this research were to validate instrumental measurements with sensory determinations, develop a classification scheme to group apples by their textural characteristics, and create models to predict sensory attributes from instrumental and compositional analyses. The textural characteristics (crispness, hardness, juiciness, and skin toughness) of 12 apple cultivars were evaluated on new and established cultivars. Fruit was also evaluated using five instrumental measurements from TA.XTplus Texture Analyzer, and three compositional determinations. The experiment was repeated for analysis and validation purposes. Principal component (PC) analysis revealed that 95.88% of the variation in the instrumental determinations could be explained by two components (PC 1 and PC 2); which were highly correlated with flesh firmness and skin strength, respectively. Four textural groups of apples were identified, and the accuracy of classification was established at 94.44% by using linear discriminant analysis. The predictive models that were developed between the sensory and instrumental-compositional data explained more than 85% of the variation in the data for hardness and crispness, while models for juiciness and skin toughness were more complex. The work should assist industry personnel to reduce time-consuming and costly sensory testing, yet have an appreciation of the textural traits as perceived by the consumer. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bekele, E. K.; Nosworthy, M. G.; Tyler, R. T.; Henry, C. J.							Antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content of direct-expanded chickpea-sorghum snacks.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study examined the effect of extrusion conditions on the antioxidant capacity (DPPH and ABTS) and total phenolics content of direct-expanded chickpea-sorghum snacks. The effect of extraction solvent on the antioxidant capacity (DPPH) detected also was determined. Chickpea-sorghum blends (50:50,60:40, and 70:30, chickpea: sorghum, w/w) were extruded at 10 combinations of moisture content (16, 18, and 20%) and barrel temperature (120,140, and 160 °C) and at 169 °C and 15% moisture, maximum extrudate expansion conditions. DPPH radical inhibition percentages of acetone-water and ethanol-water extracts were higher (p<.05) than those of hexane extracts. Total phenolics contents ranged from 1 to 7 mg gallic acid equivalents/g. Extrusion, higher barrel temperature, and a larger proportion of sorghum in the blend increased (p<.05) DPPH radical inhibition, Trolox equivalents, and total phenolics content, whereas higher moisture content decreased (p<.05) these values. The 50:50 chickpea: sorghum blend extruded at 160 °C and 16% exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity and total phenolics. Practical applications. Extruded snacks are susceptible to oxidation due to their porous structure. Chickpea-sorghum expanded snacks are even more subject to oxidation as chickpea has a relatively high-fat content. This study demonstrated that a higher level of sorghum in chickpea-sorghum snacks increased antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content, implying sorghum can play a major role in increasing the oxidative stability of the snacks. Extrusion parameters such as barrel temperature and feed moisture content also impacted the antioxidant capacity and total phenolics content of the snacks. Acetone-water and ethanol-water were superior to hexane for extracting antioxidants. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	5			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.15439					FSTA:2021-09-Ge4858
J		Bekker, G. A.; Fischer, A. R. H.; Tobi, H.; Trijp, H. C. M. van							Stuck in the middle with you: the role of similarity information on categorizing cultured meat.		Food Quality and Preference					Cultured meat is a potentially successful future alternative to conventional meat if consumers perceive it as similar enough to conventional meat. This paper aimed to investigate how consumers categorize cultured meat after receiving information about it being similar to meat or meat substitutes. The first study (N=130) showed that similarity information between cultured meat and meat resulted in the categorization of cultured meat as meat. This effect was not found for similarity information between cultured meat and meat substitutes. The second study (N=200) ruled out that the name cultured meat influenced categorization. In contrast with study 1 similarity information between cultured meat and meat did not result in categorization, where similarity information between cultured meat and meat substitutes did. The third study (N=152) suggested cultured meat was categorized as meat substitute, however, no evidence was found that providing similarity information between cultured meat and meat or meat substitutes influenced either categorization. Subsequent interviews within study 3 (N=10) suggested that cultured meat overlaps substantially with the categories meat and meat substitutes and suggested that participants had difficulty to consistently categorize cultured meat. This may explain the apparently inconsistent results. The findings of this paper thus suggest that cultured meat does not effortlessly fit into the meat or meat substitute category.

Permeability of native and digested polyphenols from apple, blueberry and cranberry extracts using PAMPA membrane permeability assays.		Journal of Food Composition and Analysis					The Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) combined to a one-compartment in vitro gastrointestinal digestion screening was used to determine the passive diffusion of polyphenols and their metabolites through artificial membranes that mimic the skin barrier, the blood-brain barrier and the gastric barrier. Identification of the polyphenols from the extracts of cranberry, blueberry and apple pomace was performed utilizing Ultra High Performance Chromatography coupled with accurate mass quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometer. The polyphenols were tested as pure compound and in complex polyphenol-rich extracts including a matrix effect. In agreement with their physicochemical properties the polyphenols showed different absorption potential. The rate of effective permeability of the polyphenols was performed to rank them into permeable and non-permeable classes using spectrophotometry. The study suggested that PAMPA models could be used as a low-cost and rapid technique to determine the passive permeability of polyphenols when compared to biological models.

Metabolomics profiling of fermented cantaloupe juice and the potential application to extend the shelf life of fresh cantaloupe juice for six months at 8 °C.		Food Control					The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of adding fermented cantaloupe juice at different concentrations to extend the shelf life of fresh cantaloupe juice stored at 8 °C for six months. Cantaloupe juice was fermented with Lactobacillus plantarum FBS05 for 48 h at 37 °C. The antimicrobial activity of the fermented juice was determined using microtiter plate assays, and the bioactive metabolites were identified using 1H NMR metabolomics analysis. Fermented juice was added to fresh juice at different ratios including 10:90, 20:80 and 30:70 (v/v) to determine the effects on the shelf life and sensory properties. Fermented cantaloupe juice demonstrated strong antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Aspergillus flavus and Penicillium spp. The 1H NMR metabolomics profiling identified 23 metabolites in fermented and non-fermented cantaloupe juice. The PCA model demonstrated significant discrimination level between the fermented and non-fermented cantaloupe juice. The metabolites responsible for the discrimination were lactic acid, GABA, acetoin, acetoacetate, cellobiose and alanine in the fermented cantaloupe juice, and sucrose, glucose, mannose and epicatechin in non-fermented cantaloupe juice. The ratio 20:80 of fermented cantaloupe juice to the fresh juice extended the shelf life for 6 months at 8 °C and sustained good sensory properties for cantaloupe juice. The findings of this study showed high potential for the fermented cantaloupe juice to be added to the fresh cantaloupe juice as natural preservative to extend the shelf life and improve the sensory properties.

Metabolomic changes and biological activities during the lacto-fermentation of jackfruit juice using Lactobacillus casei ATCC334.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aimed to evaluate the potential for developing probiotic beverage using jackfruit juice via lacto-fermentation with Lactobacillus casei ATCC334. The viable cells count was significantly (p < 0.05) increased from 6 Log10 CFU mL-1 to 8.176 Log10 CFU mL-1 after fermentation for 24 h at 37 °C and decreased to 7.672 Log10 CFU mL-1 after 3 weeks at 8 °C. The antioxidant activity increased to 305.204 mM Fe (II) /mg and DDPH IC50 15.65 mg/mL. Strong antimicrobial activity obsereved towards Escherichia coli 0157:H7 (95%), Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (98%) and Staphylococcus aureus (95%). Sugars content significantly (p < 0.05) reduced, while lactic acid and GABA significantly (p < 0.05) increased. No significant (p≥0.05) differences were observed for the overall sensory properties for fermented and non-fermented jackfruit juice. The results of this first study showed the high potential to develop probiotic beverage with broad range of biological activities via lacto-fermentation of the jackfruit juice.

A novel ammoniation treatment of barley as a strategy to optimize rumen pH, feed degradability and microbial protein synthesis in sheep.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Meeting the energy and nitrogen (N) requirements of high-performing ruminants at the same time as avoiding digestive disturbances (i.e. rumen acidosis) is a key priority in ruminant nutrition. The present study evaluated the effect of a cereal ammoniation treatment, in which barley grains are combined with urea and enzymes that catalyze the conversion of urea to ammonia to optimize rumen function. Twelve rumen cannulated sheep were randomly divided into two groups and fed a diet containing 60% of ammoniated barley (AMM) or untreated barley supplemented with urea (CTL) to investigate the impact on rumen fermentation and feed utilization. Results. AMM had higher total N content and effective rumen degradable N than untreated barely. AMM sheep had a consistently higher rumen pH throughout the day (6.31 versus 6.03) and tended to have a lower post-prandial ammonia peak and higher acetate molar proportion (+5.1%) than CTL sheep. The rumen environment in AMM sheep favored the colonization and utilization of agro-industrial by-products (i.e. orange pulp) by the rumen microbes leading to a higher feed degradability. AMM sheep also had higher total tract apparent N digestibility (+21.7%) and urinary excretion of purine derivatives (+34%), suggesting a higher N uptake and microbial protein synthesis than CTL sheep. Conclusion. The inclusion of AMM in the diet of ruminants represents a valid strategy for maintaining rumen pH within a physiological range and improving N utilization by the rumen microbes, which could have positive effects on the health and productivity of animals in intensive production systems. These findings warrant further studies under conventional farm conditions. © 2021 The Authors.

Comparison of new approach of GC-HRMS (Q-Orbitrap) to GC-MS/MS (triple-quadrupole) in analyzing the pesticide residues and contaminants in complex food matrices.		Food Chemistry					Performances of multiresidue analysis of one hundred of pesticides and contaminants, using GC-Q-Orbitrap method in full scan mode were compared to those obtained with GC-triple-quadrupole method in multiple reaction monitoring mode. In terms of sensitivity, 86% of molecules exhibited lower limit of detection values using GC-Q-Orbitrap than using GC-triple-quadrupole. For the GC-Q-Orbitrap method, more than 85% of the pesticides and contaminants showed good recovery [70-120%] in wheat samples, with relative standard deviation values < 20%. GC-Q-Orbitrap method appeared the most sensitive for most pesticides studied in wheat with limit of quantification values ranged between 0.1 g/kg and 4 g/kg. Moreover, the matrix effect was acceptable in wheat extracts for 84 molecules but strong suppression of the chromatographic signal was observed for 16 molecules for the GC-Q-Orbitrap method. The injection of unpurified wheat extracts spiked at 10 g/kg proved the potential of the GC-Q-Orbitrap method for use in performing high-throughput pesticide screening.

J		Belay, Z. A.; Botes, W. J.; Caleb, O. J.							Effects of alkaline electrolyzed water pretreatment on the physicochemical quality attributes of fresh nectarine during storage.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Chlorinated water treatment has been extensively used to manage postharvest decontamination of fruits for decades. It has been well established that chlorine may produce undesirable by-products that have a potential carcinogenic impact on human health and toxic waste on the environment. Electrolyzed water is an eco-friendly technique that has been regarded as an effective method for decontaminating microbes on fruit surfaces. However, the impact of alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW) on the physical and biochemical quality attributes of nectarine fruit during postharvest storage is not fully understood. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of AEW treatment (200 mg/L, pH, 6.7), sodium hypochlorite, and nontreated (control) on the storability, quality attribute, and decay incidence of fresh nectarine stored at -0.5 °C and 95% RH for 31 days. Results. Obtained indicated that the AEW treatment effectively maintains firmness, reduced weight loss, and maintains high total soluble solid content with a slight decline in titratable acidity for nectarines. Furthermore, the AEW suppresses the decrease of color qualities of the peel L*, a*, b*, reduced the incidence of browning (h°) and surface decay compared with chlorine-treated and control fruit. Novelty impact statement. Alkaline electrolyzed water (AEW) and its efficacy to minimize decay and maintain physicochemical quality of nectarine fruit compared with chlorinated water treatment were investigated. Treatment with AEW (200 mg/L, 10 min) effectively preserves the freshness of the nectarine fruit by reducing surface decay compared with the chlorine-treated and control fruit. The outcome of this study provides guiding tools for stone fruit pack-houses and other industry role players on the potential of EW as an alternative to chlorine treatments. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

A multi-omics approach for understanding the effects of moderate wine consumption on human intestinal health.		Food & Function					The human gut is a highly diverse microbial ecosystem. Although showing a well-defined core of dominant taxa, an interindividual variability exists in microbiome arrangement patterns, and the presence and proportion of specific species, determining individual metabolic features-metabotypes-which govern the health effects of dietary interventions (i.e. polyphenol consumption). Starting with a 19-volunteer human intervention study, divided into low, medium, and high wine-polyphenol-metabolizers, we detected interindividual discrepancies on the effect of wine consumption in gut bacterial alpha-diversity, but a significant homogenization of beta-diversity among moderate wine consumers, independently of their metabotype. In addition, the abundance of key health-related taxa such as Akkermansia sp. Increased after moderate wine intake in the group of high polyphenol-metabolizers. Regarding the metabolic activity, significant (p< 0.05) positive correlations in the production of SCFAs were observed after wine intake. Finally, we were able to correlate the microbiome and the metabolome of the three metabotypes, and to identify some metabolites-biomarker species, highlighting the genera Phascolarctobacterium, Pelotomaculum and Prevotella, as positively correlated with polyphenol concentration, and Prevotella, Zymophilus and Eubacterium as positively correlated with SCFAs concentration in faeces. Our results contribute to the evidence of the need of including the microbiome variable in personalized nutrition programs, as different metabotyes respond differently to dietary interventions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2021.

Functional properties of Lactobacillus casei C24 improved by microencapsulation using multilayer double emulsion.		Food Research International					To provide their health effect, probiotics need to maintain their viability, adhere to the intestinal epithelium, and colonize it without losing their probiotic properties. In the present study, Lactobacillus casei was encapsulated in a double emulsion and then coated with alginate and chitosan using the layer-by-layer electrostatic deposition technique. The survival rate and functional properties of L. casei (cholesterol assimilation, surface hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, and co-aggregation) were evaluated after the freeze-drying process and during the transit through the simulated gastrointestinal tract. Reservoir type multilayer microcapsules with a small particle size (6.2-12.2 mum) were obtained. Freeze-dried microcapsules maintained the initial cell count (9.4 log UFC/g) without affecting its functional properties. The resistance of L. casei cells to the conditions of salivary, gastric, and intestinal digestion was noticeably improved when increasing the number of layers in the microcapsules, especially when they were coated with alginate and chitosan. The alginate-chitosan layers provided additional protection to L. casei cell membranes, substantially preserving the cholesterol assimilation ability, surface hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, and co-aggregation of L. casei after simulated in vitro digestion. This encapsulation method not only guarantees the presence of the probiotic in the gastrointestinal tract, but it does not lose its probiotic properties and ensures that it exerts its probiotic effect.

J		Beldie, A. A.; Moraru, C. I.							Forward osmosis concentration of milk: product quality and processing considerations.		Journal of Dairy Science					Concentration of milk in the dairy industry is typically achieved by thermal evaporation or reverse osmosis (RO). Heat concentration is energy intensive and leads to cooked flavor and color changes in the final product, and RO is affected by fouling, which limits the final achievable concentration of the product. The main objective of this work was to evaluate forward osmosis (FO) as an alternative method for concentrating milk. The effects of fat content and temperature on the process were evaluated, and the physicochemical properties and sensory qualities of the final product were assessed. Commercially pasteurized skim and whole milk samples were concentrated at 4,15, and 25 °C using a bench top FO unit. The FO process was assessed by monitoring water flux and product concentration. The color of the milk concentrates was also evaluated. A sensory panel compared the FO concentrated and thermally concentrated milks, diluted to single strength, with high temperature, short time pasteurized milk. The FO experimental runs were conducted in triplicate, and data were analyzed by single-factor ANOVA. Water flux during FO decreased with time under all processing conditions. Higher temperatures led to faster concentration and higher concentration factors for both skim and whole milk. After 5.75 h of FO processing, the concentration factors achieved for skim milk were 2.68 0.08 at 25 °C, 2.68 0.09 at 15 °C, and 2.36 0.08 at 4 °C. For whole milk, after 5.75 h of FO processing, concentration factors of 2.32 0.12 at 25 °C, 2.12 0.36 at 15 °C, and 1.91 0.15 at 4 °C were obtained. Overall, maximum concentration levels of 40.15% total solids for skim milk and 40.94% total solids for whole milk were achieved. Additionally, a triangle sensory test showed no significant differences between regular milk and FO concentrated milk diluted to single strength. This work shows that FO is a viable nonthermal processing method for concentrating milk, but some technical challenges need to be overcome to facilitate commercial utilization.

Future feed control-Tracing banned bovine material in insect meal.		Food Control					In the present study, we assessed if different legacy and novel molecular analyses approaches can detect and trace prohibited bovine material in insects reared to produce processed animal protein (PAP). Newly hatched black soldier fly (BSF) larvae were fed one of the four diets for seven days; a control feeding medium (Ctl), control feed spiked with bovine hemoglobin powder (BvHb) at 1% (wet weight, w/w) (BvHb 1%, w/w), 5% (BvHb 5%, w/w) and 10% (BvHb 10%, w/w). Another dietary group of BSF larvae, namely *BvHb 10%, was first grown on BvHb 10% (w/w), and after seven days separated from the residual material and placed in another container with control diet for seven additional days. Presence of ruminant material in insect feed and in BSF larvae was assessed in five different laboratories using (i) real time-PCR analysis, (ii) multi-target ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS), (iii) protein-centric immunoaffinity-LC-MS/MS, (iv) peptide-centric immunoaffinity-LC-MS/MS, (v) tandem mass spectral library matching (SLM), and (vi) compound specific amino acid analysis (CSIA). All methods investigated detected ruminant DNA or BvHb in specific insect feed media and in BSF larvae, respectively. However, each method assessed, displayed distinct shortcomings, which precluded detection of prohibited material versus non-prohibited ruminant material in some instances. Taken together, these findings indicate that detection of prohibited material in the insect-PAP feed chain requires a tiered combined use of complementary molecular analysis approaches. We therefore advocate the use of a combined multi-tier molecular analysis suite for the detection, differentiation and tracing of prohibited material in insect-PAP based feed chains and endorse ongoing efforts to extend the currently available battery of PAP detection approaches with MS based techniques and possibly delta13CAA fingerprinting.

Journal of Food Quality					Twenty Beni-Guil-PGI female lambs were used to study the effects of rearing season on meat quality characteristics, fatty acids profile, and lipid content. The animals were reared according to the pastoral-transhumant system in the eastern region of Morocco. The treatments consisted of 10 female lambs reared in summer-autumn (SA) and slaughtered at winter season and 10 female lambs reared in winter-spring (WS) and slaughtered at spring season. After the slaughter, the longissimus lumborumwas collected for each animal for meat quality analysis. Compared to lambs reared in SA, the meat from the WS group showed higher (p<0.01) pH, chroma, and lightness values (5.79 vs. 5.72,23.97 vs. 18.46, and 47.03 vs. 41.04, respectively). On the other hand, the meat from WS presented higher (p<0.05) intramuscular fat content (5.14% vs. 3.82%, respectively). However, the intramuscular fat of the lambs reared in SA was characterized by greater (p<0.01) () PUFA percentage (16.82% vs. 12.40%, respectively), thrombogenic (p<0.001) and atherogenic index (p<0.001), and PUFA/SFA ratio (p<0.001) (; 0.42 vs. 0.25, respectively). Nevertheless, those reared in WS season have a higher (p<0.001) PUFA n-3 (2.58% vs. 1.14%, respectively) content, and therefore favorable (p<0.001) n-6/ n-3 ratio (3.78 vs. 12.98, respectively).

Of the 71 botanical taxa reported, the most popular were Vaccinium vitis-idaea, Vaccinium oxycoccos, Vaccinium myrtillus, Betula spp., and Rumex acetosa. The obtained data was compared with that of 37 Setos and 35 Estonians interviewed at the same time on the other side of the border. Our data revealed a substantial level of homogeneity within the plants used by three or more people with 30 of 56 plants overlapping across all four groups. However, Seto groups are ethnobotanically closer to the dominant ethnic groups immediately surrounding them than they are to Setos across the border. Further study of minor ethnic groups in a post-Soviet context is needed, paying attention to knowledge transmission patterns. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Overcoming matrix effects in the analysis of pyrethroids in honey by a fully automated direct immersion solid-phase microextraction method using a matrix-compatible fiber.		Food Chemistry					Pyrethroids insecticides may constitute a major hazard to honeybees, leading to colony collapse disorder. However, the determination of pyrethroids in honey has remained a challenging undertaking for analysts to date due to the high complexity of this matrix as well as the MRLs. This paper presents a fully automated method to overcome matrix influences using matrix-compatible overcoated SPME fiber for quantitative analysis of pyrethroids in diluted honey by GC-MS. The developed method was optimized using a multivariate approach providing LOQ values much lower than the stablished MRL (0.10-10 ng/g), while granting satisfactory linearity (R2> 0.998) in a wide linear range of 0.1-2000 ng/g, repeatability with RSDs < 10%, reproducibility RSDs < 20%, and accuracy ranging from 75 to 118% and from 82 to 120% for inter-day and intra-day assays, respectively by using five replicates. The method herein proposed overcomes challenges presented by complex matrices while minimizing sample handling and the overall complexity of the procedure.

J		Belinato, J. R.; Costa, C. P.; Almeida, A.; Rocha, S. M.; Augusto, F.							Mapping Aspergillus nigermetabolite biomarkers for in situ and early evaluation of table grapes contamination.		Foods					The Aspergillus niger exometabolome was recently investigated using advanced gas chromatography in tandem with multivariate analysis, which allowed a metabolite biomarker pattern to be proposed. Microbial metabolomics patterns have gained enormous relevance, mainly due to the amount of information made available, which may be useful in countless processes. One of the great challenges in microbial metabolomics is related to applications in more complex systems of metabolomics information obtained from studies carried out in culture media, as complications may occur due to the dynamic nature of biological systems. Thus, the main objective of this research was to evaluate the applicability of the A. niger metabololite biomarkers pattern for in situ and early evaluation of table grapes contamination, used as study model. A. niger is a ubiquitous fungus responsible for food contamination, being reported as one of the main agents of the black mold disease, a serious post-harvest pathology of table grapes. This work included analysis from 1 day of growth time of pure A. niger cultures, A. niger cultures obtained from previously contaminated grapes, and finally, an in situ solid-phase microextraction (SPME) approach directly on previously contaminated table grapes. Supervised multivariate analysis was performed which revealed that after 1 day of inoculation it was possible to detect A. niger biomarkers, which can be extremely useful in making this type of method possible for the rapid detection of food contamination. The results obtained confirm the potential applicability of the pattern of A. niger biomarkers for early detection of the fungi (after 1 day of contamination), and may be further explored for access food susceptibility to fungi contamination, based on direct analysis of the food item. © 2021 by the authors.

Influence of dough composition on the formation of processing contaminants in yeast-leavened wheat toasted bread.		Food Chemistry					The influence of dough composition on acrylamide, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD) esters, and glycidyl esters (GE) formation during bread toasting was investigated. The doughs differed in added amounts of soy lecithin, salt, and reducing agents (l-cysteine and glutathione). The toasting of bread for 2.5 min considerably enhanced the formation of acrylamide and 3-MCPD esters. The addition of lecithin (1%, w/w) resulted in four times higher content of 3-MCPD esters in toasted bread slices. No distinct relationship between dough composition and GE formation in untoasted and toasted bread was found. The addition of reducing agents (0.05%, w/w) mitigated during toasting not only the formation of 3-MCPD esters (more than six times) but also the extent of Maillard reaction that resulted in three times lower amounts of acrylamide and predominant formation of alcohol-like compounds. Toasted bread without reducing agents contained typical Maillard reaction compounds such as aldehydes, alkyl pyrazines, and derivatives of furan. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Bell, L.; Kitsopanou, E.; Oloyede, O. O.; Lignou, S.							Important odorants of four Brassicaceae species, and discrepancies between glucosinolate profiles and observed hydrolysis products.		Foods					It is widely accepted that the distinctive aroma and flavour traits of Brassicaceae crops are produced by glucosinolate (GSL) hydrolysis products (GHPs) with other non-GSL derived compounds also reported to contribute significantly to their aromas. This study investigated the flavour profile and glucosinolate content of four Brassicaceae species (salad rocket, horseradish, wasabi, and watercress). Solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-olfactometry were used to determine the volatile compounds and odorants present in the four species. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to determine the glucosinolate composition, respectively. A total of 113 compounds and 107 odour-active components were identified in the headspace of the four species. Of the compounds identified, 19 are newly reported for 'salad" rocket, 26 for watercress, 30 for wasabi, and 38 for horseradish, marking a significant step forward in understanding and characterising aroma generation in these species. There were several non-glucosinolate derived compounds contributing to the "pungent" aroma profile of the species, indicating that the glucosinolate-derived compounds are not the only source of these sensations in Brassicaceae species. Several discrepancies between observed glucosinolates and hydrolysis products were observed, and we discuss the implications of this for future studies. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bell, L.; Williams, C. M.							Blueberry benefits to cognitive function across the lifespan.		International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition					It is well known that what we eat can influence our physical wellbeing, but interest is also increasing in the relationship between our diet and cognitive health. In recent years, blueberries have risen from relative obscurity to superfood status following a number of published epidemiological studies, rodent trials, and human RCTs, that suggest blueberries may convey benefits to cognition and mood. This commentary explores some of the evidence in humans, particularly during periods of cognitive development in the young and cognitive decline in the elderly. Evidence for possible mechanisms of action are also described. There is little doubt that blueberries convey a small, but tangible, benefit to cognitive function. Effects are seen following dose sizes easily achievable within a normal diet. Nevertheless, further research is needed on the cognitive domains influenced, additional benefits of longer-term supplementation, mechanisms of action responsible, and the real-world relevance of the cognitive benefits attained. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

J		Bella, G. di; Potorti, A. G.; Beltifa, A.; Mansour, H. B.; Nava, V.; Turco, V. lo							Discrimination of Tunisian honey by mineral and trace element chemometrics profiling.		Foods					The concentrations of 19 chemical elements have been determined in 36 honey samples of different botanical (wildflower, eucalyptus, eucalyptus red flowers, prickly pears, lemon blossom, thyme, almond, rosemary and jujube) honeys from the three geographical areas of Tunisia (Sidi Bouzid, Nabeul and Sfax) using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The aim of this work was to use the multi-element analysis together with chemometric tools to verify the botanical and the geographical origin of honeys. The correlation on the basis of mineral element content between the honey samples and their botanical and/or geographical origins was in some measure achieved. The data collected on the samples were also used to evaluate the nutritional quality and the potential health risks associated with elements via consumption of the Tunisian honey. According to the results obtained, the intake of essential elements was small, and the potential health risks associated with toxic or potentially toxic elements via consumption of this food were overall insignificant. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bellassi, P.; Rocchetti, G.; Nocetti, M.; Lucini, L.; Masoero, F.; Morelli, L.							A combined metabolomic and metagenomic approach to discriminate raw milk for the production of hard cheese.		Foods					The chemical composition of milk can be significantly affected by different factors across the dairy supply chain, including primary production practices. Among the latter, the feeding system could drive the nutritional value and technological properties of milk and dairy products. Therefore, in this work, a combined foodomics approach based on both untargeted metabolomics and metagenomics was used to shed light onto the impact of feeding systems (i.e., hay vs. A mixed ration based on hay and fresh forage) on the chemical profile of raw milk for the production of hard cheese. In particular, ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF) was used to investigate the chemical profile of raw milk (n=46) collected from dairy herds located in the Po River Valley (Italy) and considering different feeding systems. Overall, a total of 3320 molecular features were putatively annotated across samples, corresponding to 734 unique compound structures, with significant differences (p< 0.05) between the two feeding regimens under investigation. Additionally, supervised multivariate statistics following metabolomics-based analysis allowed us to clearly discriminate raw milk samples according to the feeding systems, also extrapolating the most discriminant metabolites. Interestingly, 10 compounds were able to strongly explain the differences as imposed by the addition of forage in the cows" diet, being mainly glycerophospholipids (i.e., lysophosphatidylethanolamines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylcholines), followed by 5-(3′, 4′-Dihydroxyphenyl)-gamma-valerolactone-4′-O-glucuronide, 5a-androstan-3a, 17b-diol disulfuric acid, and N-stearoyl glycine. The markers identified included both feed-derived (such as phenolic metabolites) and animal-derived compounds (such as lipids and derivatives). Finally, although characterized by a lower prediction ability, the metagenomic profile was found to be significantly correlated to some milk metabolites, with Staphylococcaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, and Dermabacteraceae establishing a higher number of significant correlations with the discriminant metabolites. Therefore, taken together, our preliminary results provide a comprehensive foodomic picture of raw milk samples from different feeding regimens, thus supporting further ad hoc studies investigating the metabolomic and metagenomic changes of milk in all processing conditions. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bellassi, P.; Rocchetti, G.; Morelli, L.; Senizza, B.; Lucini, L.; Cappa, F.							A milk foodomics investigation into the effect of Pseudomonas fluorescens growth under cold chain conditions.		Foods					Pseudomonas fluorescens is a psychrotrophic species associated with milk spoilage because of its lipolytic and proteolytic activities. Consequently, monitoring P. fluorescens or its antecedent activity in milk is critical to preventing quality defects of the product and minimizing food waste. Therefore, in this study, untargeted metabolomics and peptidomics were used to identify the changes in milk related to P. fluorescens activity by simulating the low-temperature conditions usually found in milk during the cold chain. Both unsupervised and supervised multivariate statistical approaches showed a clear effect caused by the P. fluorescens inoculation on milk samples. Our results showed that the levels of phosphatidylglycerophosphates and glycerophospholipids were directly related to the level of contamination. In addition, our metabolomic approach allowed us to detect lipid and protein degradation products that were directly correlated with the degradative metabolism of P. fluorescens. Peptidomics corroborated the proteolytic propensity of P. fluorescens-contaminated milk, but with lower sensitivity. The results obtained from this study provide insights into the alterations related to P. fluorescens 39 contamination, both pre and post heat treatment. This approach could represent a potential tool to retrospectively understand the actual quality of milk under cold chain storage conditions, either before or after heat treatments. © 2021 by the authors.

Case study on the microbiological quality, chemical and sensorial profiles of different dairy creams and ricotta cheese during shelf-life.		Foods					This work investigated the microbiological quality and chemical profiles of two different dairy creams obtained by centrifugation vs. natural creaming separation systems. To this aim, an untargeted metabolomics approach based on UHPLC-QTOF mass spectrometry was used in combination with multivariate statistical tools to find potential marker compounds of the two different types of two dairy creams. Thereafter, we evaluated the chemical, microbiological and sensorial changes of a ricotta cheese made with a 30% milk cream (i.e., made by combining dairy creams from centrifugation and natural creaming separation) during its shelf-life period (12 days). Overall, microbiological analysis revealed no significant differences between the two types of dairy creams. On the contrary, the trend observed in the growth of degradative bacteria in ricotta during shelf-life was significant. Metabolomics revealed that triacylglycerols and phospholipids showed significant strong down-accumulation trends when comparing samples from the centrifugation and natural creaming separation methods. Additionally, 2,3-Pentanedione was among the best discriminant compounds characterising the shelf-life period of ricotta cheese (VIP score = 1.02), mainly related to sensorial descriptors, such as buttery and cheesy. Multivariate statistics showed a clear impact of the shelf-life period on the ricotta cheese, revealing 139 potential marker compounds (mainly included in amino acids and lipids). Therefore, the approach used showed the potential of a combined metabolomic, microbiological and sensory approach to discriminate ricotta cheese during the shelf-life period. © 2021 by the authors.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Focussed assessment of certain existing maximum residues levels of concern for abamectin.		EFSA Journal					In compliance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) received from the European Commission a mandate to provide its reasoned opinion on the existing maximum residue levels (MRLs) for abamectin which might lead to consumers intake concerns on the basis of the lower toxicological reference values established during the peer review, the data currently available to EFSA and the outcome of the Member States' consultation. To identify the MRLs of potential concern that require a more detailed assessment, EFSA screened the existing MRLs for abamectin considering the new toxicological reference values and an acute risk could not be excluded for 12 commodities. Fall-back MRLs for nine commodities were proposed based on the data received under the present assessment. For apples, pears and escaroles, fall-back MRLs could not be derived, and thus, a lowering of the MRLs for these crops to the limit of quantification (LOQ) is proposed. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

EFSA (European Food Safety Authority)				Setting of import tolerances for flutianil in various crops.		EFSA Journal					In accordance with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, the applicant OAT Agrio Co. Ltd submitted a request to the competent national authority in Belgium (originally the United Kingdom) to set import tolerances for the active substance flutianil in various crops. The data submitted in support of the request were found to be sufficient to derive MRL proposals for apples, cherries, strawberries, cucumbers and courgettes. For melons, data gaps were identified which precluded the derivation of MRL proposals. Adequate analytical methods for enforcement are available to control the residues of flutianil in the commodities under consideration at the validated limit of quantification (LOQ) of 0.01 mg/kg.

EFSA Journal					According to Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA has reviewed the maximum residue levels (MRLs) currently established at European level for the pesticide active substances Beta-cyfluthrin and Cyfluthrin. Although these active substances are no longer authorised for use on edible crops within the European Union, MRLs were established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (codex maximum residue limits (CXLs)) and import tolerances were reported by Member States (including the supporting residues data). Based on the assessment of the available data, EFSA assessed the CXLs and import tolerances requested, and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. All CXLs were found to be sufficiently supported by data, whereas some import tolerances were not supported by adequate data. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only and further consideration by risk managers is needed.

European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)				Reasoned opinion on the toxicological properties and maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the benzimidazole substances carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl.		EFSA Journal					In compliance with Article 43 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005, EFSA received from the European Commission a mandate to provide its reasoned opinion on the toxicological properties and maximum residue levels (MRLs) for the benzimidazole substances carbendazim and thiophanate-methyl. Specifically, EFSA was asked to assess whether thiophanate-methyl or carbendazim have clastogenic potential and, in case clastogenic potential can be excluded, to derive toxicological reference values necessary for consumer risk assessment and assessment of maximum residue levels (MRLs). Although these active substances are no longer authorised within the European Union, MRLs were established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (codex maximum residue limits; CXLs), and import tolerances are in place. Based on the assessment of the available data, toxicological reference values and MRL proposals were derived and a consumer risk assessment was carried out. Some information required by the regulatory framework was found to be missing and a possible acute risk to consumers was identified. Hence, the consumer risk assessment is considered indicative only, all MRL proposals derived by EFSA still require further consideration by risk managers and measures for reduction of the consumer exposure should also be considered. © 2021 European Food Safety Authority.

Aqueous extract of Paullinia cupana attenuates renal and hematological effects associated with ketoprofen.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					This study aimed to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of Paullinia cupana (AEG) against ketoprofen side effects, through biochemical, hematological, and histological parameters. AEG showed antioxidant activity in the DPPH scavenging (IC50=17.001.00 g/ml) and HPLC analysis revealed that this extract is constituted by antioxidants (caffeine, catechins, theobromine, and polyphenols). In vivo experiments in female Wistar rats demonstrated that alterations in urea, creatinine, and uric acid levels promoted (p<.05) by ketoprofen were reversed when AEG was co-administered. Ketoprofen significantly decreased the catalase levels of animal tissues (p<.05), which were restored when AEG was co-administered with the mentioned drug. Histological analysis showed that AEG protected tissues from damages caused by ketoprofen. Moreover, AEG reestablished the number of white blood cells, which had decreased when ketoprofen was administered. In conclusion, this study suggested that the association between ketoprofen and AEG may be an alternative to reduce health damages caused by this drug. Practical applications. Paullinia cupana, popularly known as guarana, is commonly consumed as a beverage in Brazil and exhibits pharmacological and beneficial effects to humans. Ketoprofen is an efficacious drug employed in the treatment of inflammatory processes. However, this drug can cause several side effects in humans. Thus, the usage of natural products and plant extracts that can reduce such undesirable effects consists in a valuable strategy to be applied in therapeutic interventions. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Multi-target detection of egg-white and pig gelatin fining agents in Nebbiolo-based aged red wine by means of nanoHPLC-HRMS.		Food Chemistry					The presence of residues from fining agents in wines may represent a risk for allergic consumers and a source of discomfort for others, such as vegans. Even though ELISA is the official detection method for such residues, this technique may be hindered by cross-reactivity issues, or by matrix-molecule interference due to a high polyphenol content, especially in red wines. An HRMS-based method has been developed to detect pig gelatin and egg white in experimental five-year aged Nebbiolo-based red wine. Biomarker peptides were selected, after tryptic digestion, and quantified by multitarget nanoHPLC-HRMS analysis. The method resulted in an LLOQs of 5 g/mL in the experimental wine, and between 1 and 2 g/mL in the buffer. This method allowed both gelatin and egg white proteins to be detected and quantified in aged red wine, while whereas the commercial ELISA kit was instead unable to detect egg white in the same samples.

Microbiota and volatilome of dry-cured pork loins manufactured with paprika and reduced concentration of nitrite and nitrate.		Food Research International					Dry-cured pork loin is a very popular meat product in Mediterranean countries. Pork-loin is manufactured rubbing curing salts, nitrite and nitrate, and spices on the surface of the loin which is then dry-cured or smoked for several months. Although nitrite-derived compounds are crucial for the microbiological safety and development of a distinct flavour, there have been recent concerns about the adverse health effects of nitrite-derived compounds driving to the reduction of curing agents in meat products. In this study, we have evaluated the differences in microbiota and aroma of dry-cured pork loins manufactured with or without paprika and reduced ingoing amounts of nitrate and nitrite. Staphylococcus dominated the microbiota of pork loins without paprika, regardless of the nitrite and nitrate reduction. On the contrary, the reduction of nitrite and nitrate in loins with paprika had an important effect on the microbiota. In these loins a codominance of Staphylococcus and Bacillus together by Enterobacteriaceae occurred. Moreover, paprika addition and reduction of nitrite and nitrate seemed to promote proliferation of lactic acid bacteria. Occurrence of these genera was correlated with the generation of free amino acids and their derived volatile compounds setting clear differences in the aroma profile of dry-cured loins.

Meat Science					The antioxidant effects of red pitaya extract (PE) were evaluated in pork patties for 18 days at 2 °C. The following treatments were prepared: control (CON, without antioxidant), sodium erythorbate (ERY, 500 mg kg-1), PE low dose (PEL, 250 mg kg-1), PE medium dose (PEM, 500 mg kg-1), and PE high dose (PEH, 1000 mg kg-1). No significant effect was observed on chemical composition and cooking loss with the addition of PE, while a significant effect was noticed in cohesiveness (P< 0.05). The intense pink colour of PE enhanced the colour stability during storage (9.33,7.92 and 7.69 vs. 6.77 for PEH, PEM and PEL vs. CON, respectively; (P< 0.05). TBARS (1.21 vs. 2.44 mg MDA/kg) and carbonyl values (5.45 vs. 6.87 nmol carbonyl/mg) of treated samples were lower than those observed in CON. Similar values were found between samples with PE and ERY. PE improved colour acceptance and the preference of pork patties. Therefore, PE is a very effective natural antioxidant by delaying colour and oxidative deterioration.

A by-product from virgin olive oil production (pate) encapsulated by fluid bed coating: evaluation of the phenolic profile after shelf-life test and invitro gastrointestinal digestion.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					Pate is a by-product of virgin olive oil production presenting a high phenolic content and beneficial health effects. This research aims to evaluate the storage stability of phenolic compounds of pate and a coated formulation, and to verify the bioaccessibility of the phenolic compounds. An accelerated shelf-life test at 40°C/75% relative humidity was carried out for 75 days. Different combinations of degradative and hydrolytic reactions impacted the results. Indeed, at the end of the storage period, 84% of phenols was recovered in pate with free tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol showing an increase due to secoiridoids hydrolysis. The total phenolic content of coated pate did not significantly decrease, showing a higher increment of free tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Simulated digestion led to the liberation of 15% of phenols by both samples. In conclusion, the coating process improved the stability of pate phenolic compounds without affecting their bioaccessibility. © 2021 The Authors.

Effects of different stabilization techniques on the shelf life of cold brew coffee: chemical composition, flavor profile and microbiological analysis.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Cold brew coffee is a beverage prepared at low temperatures and over long brewing times resulting in particular physicochemical and sensory characteristics. This type of coffee is usually consumed immediately after preparation or after short storage in refrigerated conditions. However, in recent years many commercial coffee vendors started investing in ready-to-drink cold brew coffees packaged for extended storage. These products present the potential problem of microbial and sensorial alteration. In this study we evaluated five different stabilization techniques with the aim to extend the shelf life of the cold brew coffee while preserving its peculiar organoleptic properties, e.g. HPP (High Pressure Processing), microfiltration, UV irradiation, pasteurization and blast chilling process. The effects were investigated over four months, evaluating the caffeine and the chlorogenic acids contents by HPLC-DAD analysis and carrying out anevaluation of selected volatile compounds by HS-SPME-GC-MS. After four months of storage, the samples treated with pasteurization and HPP maintained a stable content of caffeine and chlorogenic acids, guaranteeing also the microbiological safety of the beverage. At the same shelf-time, the pasteurized samples showed an unaltered flavor profile, while a decrease of about 25% of the total content of volatile compounds was registered for the HPP sample.

Chemical analysis, antibacterial, and antioxidant activities of flavonoid-rich extracts from four Moroccan propolis.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Propolis, a resinous substance collected by honeybees from plants, is well-known worldwide for its diversified biological activities. This study was aimed to determine the chemical composition of four ethanol extracts of propolis collected from Morocco and to investigate their antibacterial and antioxidant activities. The chemical composition was determined by Ultra-High Performance Liquid Chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The antibacterial activity was evaluated using the well diffusion and microdilution methods. The antioxidant activity was investigated in vitro using three complementary techniques, namely reduction power, beta-carotene bleaching, and DPPH scavenging assays. The identified molecules belong mainly to the flavonoid family, and interestingly, several of them were flavonoid glycosides. The four extracts showed strong antibacterial activity. The inhibitory zones varied from 10.0000 to 22.52.12 mm, and minimal inhibitory concentration values ranged from 0.15 to >5 mg/ml, while minimal bactericidal concentration values ranged from 1.25 to >5 mg/ml. The antioxidant activity was relatively strong compared to positive controls, with IC50 varied from 67.61 to 140.04 g/ml against DPPH free radical, and a relative antioxidant activity varied from 68.403.90 to 100.924.24, determined by beta-carotene bleaching test. The antioxidant property was related to the chemical constituents. These results indicate that Moroccan propolis can be a valuable source of bioactive compounds for further drug discovery. Novelty impact statement. More than 100 compounds have been identified in Moroccan propolis extracts. Trigonelline (an alkaloid) was identified for the first time in propolis. Propolis extracts exhibited strong antibacterial and antioxidant activity. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Modification of coffee coproducts by-products by dynamic high pressure, acetylation and hydrolysis by cellulase: a potential functional and sustainable food ingredient.		Innovative Food Science and Emerging Technologies					Coffee coproducts (CCP) are significant sources of dietary fiber (DF) and phenolic compounds. Dynamic high-pressure (DHP), acetylation (ACT) and enzymatic hydrolysis with cellulase (ENZ) were investigated as methods to change the technological properties of CCP. The impact of the methods on DF structure and phenolic antioxidants was also assessed. DHP, ACT and ENZ have improved the Water Holding Capacity, Swelling Power and Oil Holding Capacity of CCP by up to 1.50,1.80 and 1.90 times, respectively. DHP caused the most severe effect in disrupting the DF of the CCP, reducing the particle size. Total and Insoluble DF of CCP (0.63 and 0.58 g/g CCP, respectively) decreased significantly after ACT and ENZ. DHP only caused a minor impact on chlorogenic acid of CCP, leading to a smaller reduction in the antioxidant capacity as compared to that of ACT and ENZ. A potential functional and sustainable food ingredient from CCP with improved technological properties and partial maintenance of its antioxidant status was obtained. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Applicability of high-resolution NMR in combination with chemometrics for the compositional analysis and quality control of spices and plant-derived condiments.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Over the last years, the consumption of spices and plant-derived condiments has increased considerably, owing to new culinary trends. Unfortunately, the current marketing channels make them highly vulnerable to adulteration and food fraud. High-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful tool for the compositional study of spices and plant-derived condiments. It allows the chemical characterization of a wide range of polar and non-polar metabolites, and provides unique structural information not available by other techniques. The chemometric-based analysis of NMR "fingerprints" has been used to discriminate samples according to species and geographical origin and to detect adulterations, among other applications. The comprehensive identification and quantification of marker compounds can be achieved even in complex mixtures, demonstrating a great potential for high-throughtput quality control applications. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.		/A-3900-2012	/0000-0002-2505-2056; Belmonte Sanchez, Eva/0000-0002-6720-6797; Garrido Frenich, Antonia/0000-0002-7904-7842							2021	101	9	3541	3550	0022-5142				10.1002/jsfa.11051					FSTA:2021-10-Te3602

Journal of Food Process Engineering					The effect of microwave pretreatment on the exchange energy of forage barley was studied using the developed experimental setup. The novelty of the developed experimental setup in the summation of the power of microwave magnetrons in the waveguide, which provides an increase in productivity up to 50kg/h while reducing energy consumption to 0.04kWh/kg. The hypothesis of summation of the power of microwave magnetrons has been confirmed using a computer model in CST Studio. The average combined power of two magnetrons is 13VA/m2. Using the method of planning the full factorial experiment, experimental studies of microwave pretreatment of forage barley of the second class with an exchange energy of 12MJ/kg were carried out. Optimized significant factors affecting the pretreatment, such as grain moisture 16.5%, device power level 2, and the height of the waveguide end relative to the grain layer 41.7mm. With these experimental parameters, the level of the exchange energy of forage barley will be 13.1 MJ/kg, which corresponds to forage barley of the first class. Microwave pretreatment of grain by increasing the exchange energy can increase the nutritional value of grain. Practical applications. Increasing the exchange energy and nutritional value of forage barley will increase its digestibility by animals. It is proposed to use the developed microwave setup in agricultural farms to reduce energy consumption for grain pretreatment before feeding animals. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Belton, B.; Myat Thida Win; Xiaobo Zhang; Filipski, M.							The rapid rise of agricultural mechanization in Myanmar.		Food Policy					The past decade has seen a resurgence of interest in the role of mechanization in agricultural development. This literature has given rise to debates over the design of institutions and policies to facilitate accelerated mechanization, the role of outsourcing services in overcoming problems of access to machinery, and questions regarding the future of smallholder agriculture. We contribute to these debates using two pairs of complementary demand side (farm household) and supply side (agricultural machinery retailer) surveys, implemented in Myanmar in 2016 and 2017 across two major agro-ecological zones. Our analysis provides evidence that extremely rapid agricultural mechanization took place during the period of political and economic reforms from 2011 to 2020. In both zones surveyed, use of machinery for land preparation, harvesting, and threshing was close to scale-neutral due to a dynamic outsourcing services market. Rather than representing a single transformational change, mechanization's broad appeal to farm households results from an accumulation of incremental, overlapping, complementary advantages. These include labor savings, reduced drudgery, convenience, increased speed and timeliness of operations, improved ability to manage weather-related risks, and reduced loss of grain during harvesting. We provide examples of policies on trade, finance, and land tenure that contributed to this transformation with practical implications for ongoing policy debates on mechanization in other countries, and suggest some generalizable lessons.

Digital images and independent components analysis in the determination of bioactive compounds from grape juice.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Analytical methods based on digital images coupled to chemometric tools are promising alternatives for developing analytical methodologies in determining quality parameters in foods. The total phenolics, monomeric anthocyanins, and tannin content were quantified based on digital images and pseudo-univariate calibration performed from Independent Components Analysis (ICA). Differences between ICA, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Multivariate Curve Resolution with Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS), highlighting the chosen ICA for this proposal, were explained. In all pseudo-univariate calibration curves, correlation coefficients higher than 0.9 were achieved. The results suggest that digital images coupled with ICA can give applicable pseudo-univariate calibration models to determine bioactive compounds. Even more, the device to obtain an image is cheaper than most analytical instruments. Digital images may have a promising future in developing analytical methodologies for complex samples such as foods from a pseudo-univariate calibration perspective (where a small data set is needed in the calibration step).

Effect of simulated acidic and salty fermentation conditions on kinetic growth parameters and probiotic potential of Lactobacillus acidipiscis and Lactobacillus pentosus.		International Journal of Food Science & Technology					The technological stress during food processing may alter the beneficial interactions of food-associated Lactobacillus on the host. The effect of initial combined acidic (pH 5.0) and osmotic stress (NaCl 5%, w/v with or without CaCl2 0.02%, w/v) typically present in vegetable fermentations and cheesemaking were investigated. The growth kinetics prediction, hydrophobicity, auto-aggregation, in vitro survival and adhesion were determined in Lactobacillus acidipiscis and Lactobacillus pentosus isolated from a Mexican salty cheese. The growth was modelled with the modified Gompertz equation (R> 0.99; RMSE < 0.01). The lag phase increased (>10 h), and auto-aggregation was reduced. Hydrophobicity and S-layer total proteins varied. Gut survival reduced >4 log 10 units compared to the initial intake. Nevertheless, adhesion remained the same. Hence, combined stress affected the technological and physiological properties of both strains negatively.

J		Beltran, G.; Bejaoui, M. A.; Sanchez-Ortiz, A.; Jimenez, A.							Water addition during oil extraction affects on virgin olive oil ethanol content, quality and composition.		European Journal of Lipid Science and Technology					Ethanol is the alcoholic precursor of fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) in virgin olive oil (VOO). Because of its miscibility, water addition during oil extraction may affect oil ethanol content and then, the FAEEs synthesis during oil storage. In this work, the effect of water addition on VOO ethanol content and composition is studied. Water addition at two extraction systems (two and three phases) is compared and for vertical centrifuge, water addition at different temperatures is assayed. Ethanol content, quality parameters, and healthy components are determined in the oils. Results indicate three phase system gives oils with a 25% lower ethanol content than two phases. Ethanol reduction because of water addition is more important for three phases system (14%). For vertical centrifugation, ethanol is lowered as water dose and temperature increase. In general, water addition for any of the extraction steps analyzed reduces the oil ethanol concentration but other aspects such as fruity intensity and phenol content are also lowered. Practical applications. Virgin olive oil final ethanol content, and then its FAEEs concentration, does not only depend on the health and conservation status of olives, but also on the extraction system used and the amount of water added to the extraction process. The knowledge of the impact on ethanol content of water addition during oil extraction can be useful for olive oil legislators in order to keep the approved limits of FAEEs or to modify them. For oil producers, results can help to reduce the oil ethanol content and then FAEEs synthesis during virgin olive oil storage. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.										2021	123	11			1438-7697				10.1002/ejlt.202000400					FSTA:2022-03-Ne0486

How olive washing and storage affect fruit ethanol and virgin olive oil ethanol, ethyl esters and composition.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Olives are stored for a short time after harvesting pending processing in the oil mills. Furthermore, olives are often washed prior to fruit storage. In this work we study how washing and storage affect fruit ethanol content and the effect on virgin olive oil ethanol content and quality. Results. Olive storage produced an increase in the fruit ethanol content, achieving values six times higher when storage was in silos. Washing the olives resulted in an increase in fruit ethanol content, although when washed olives were processed immediately no difference was found. The increase in fruit ethanol content during storage was reflected in higher oil ethanol concentration. Similarly, olive washing resulted in oils with higher ethanol concentration. Industrial conditions gave more important increases in oil ethanol content than that from olives processed by hand. For quality parameters all the olive oils were classified as "extra virgin". In general, oils showed a slight decrease in some sensory attributes. At industrial scale after 24h storage oils were classified as "virgin" because sensory defects were found. Conclusion. Olive storage should be avoided or reduced to less than 12h; if possible, olives should not be washed before storage since this practice favors losses in sensory characteristics and the synthesis of ethanol, a precursor of ethyl esters. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Electrosynthesis of three-dimensional nanoporous nickel on screen-printed electrode used for the determination of narirutin in citrus wastewater.		Food Chemistry					In this study, an electrochemical sensor was designed for the detection of narirutin using three-dimensional nanostructured porous nickel on screen-printed electrode (3DnpNi/SPE). The modified electrode was successfully synthesized by the dynamic hydrogen bubble template method. The 3DnpNi/SPE was characterized by spectroscopic, microscopic, and electrochemical methods. The results showed that the 3DnpNi/SPE presents good electrocatalytic activity for the oxidation of narirutin. The quantification of narirutin was conducted by differential pulse voltammetry, which showed a wide concentration range (1.0*10-7-1.0*10-5 mol L-1), with low detection limit (3.9*10-8 mol L-1), and excellent sensitivity (0.31 A L mol-1). The proposed electrode was applied toward the determination of narirutin in yellow water sample from the citrus industry, where it presented a good degree of accuracy.

Do consumers perceive sensory differences by knowing information about coffee quality?		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Coffee is a very complex drink, with different sensory characteristics, which directly influences in its acceptance. In general, the coffee quality assessments by experts do not correspond to consumer preferences. This study aimed to assess consumers' sensory response to coffee treatments classified as special and non-special (by cuppers), with different roasts (light and dark), in sensory tests with and without information about quality, type of roasting and price of coffees. Check-All-That-Apply (CATA) and acceptance tests were performed to evaluate the treatments. In CATA analysis, without information, only one attribute was significant to differ the treatments (p < 0.05). Contrastly, in CATA analysis with information, nine attributes were detected that contributed to the differentiation between the special coffees with light roasting and the other coffees. There was no significant difference between the treatments (p > 0.05) in the acceptance tests without information, for the flavor and overall acceptance attributes. In general, the scores assigned to special coffees were higher than those assigned to non-special coffees, in the acceptance tests with information. Therefore, the characteristics of special coffees can be used as a marketing strategy by industries, to increase theirs sales and to optimize the consumers' sensory experience with the drink.

J		Bemiller, J. N.							Effect of hydrocolloids on normal and waxy maize starches cross-linked with epichlorohydrin.		Food Hydrocolloids					Research was conducted to test the hypothesis that the surface charge on maize starch granules cross-linked with POCl3 affects how hydrocolloids (HC) interact with them. Normal (NMS) and waxy maize (WMS) starches were cross-linked with epichlorohydrin (ECH) to 2 extents. The products were heated in water or one of 9 HC solutions, and the pasting and paste properties and the rheological attributes of the produced gels were determined and compared to those of POCl3 cross-linked NMS and WMS. Results confirm the hypothesis that the ability of HC to alter early events in the pasting process is an important factor in their effects in altering the properties of starch pastes, as all HC used appeared to have an effect on granule swelling of heated slurries of both native and cross-linked starches. Differences in the effect produced by the different HC on the pasting and paste properties of POCl3 and ECH cross-linked products of both NMS and WMS appeared primarily to be in degree and unrelated to whether the cross-linked starch had a negative surface charge. Two mechanisms are proposed for the influence of HC on granule swelling: 1) strengthening of granules via interactions with HC molecules, and 2) inhibition of water penetration and, therefore, granule swelling by plugging of granule micro- and mesopores by those hydrated HC molecules that are too large to enter them. Rheological properties of the produced gels determined before and after cold storage also had both similarities and differences in effects produced by addition of a HC.

J		Ben Bacha, A.; Al-Orf, N.; Mona Alonazi; Shafi Bhat, R.; El-Ansary, A.							The anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects of probiotic on induced neurotoxicity in juvenile hamsters.		Food Science & Nutrition					Brain inflammation and apoptosis play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of various neurodevelopmental disorders. Probiotics have been shown to confer protection against many stresses, including apoptosis and inflammation, by modulating the gut function. The short-chain fatty acid, propionic acid (PPA), plays an important intermediate of cellular metabolism. Although PPA exhibits numerous beneficial biological effects, its accumulation is neurotoxic. This study focused on the therapeutic potency of probiotics against PPA-induced apoptosis and neuroinflammation in hamsters. Five groups of male golden Syrian hamsters were treated as follows: Group I as control; Group II as PPA-treated with three doses of 250 mg PPA/kg/day; Group III as clindamycin-treated with a single dose of 30 mg clindamycin/kg; Group IV as PPA-probiotic; and Group V as clindamycin-probiotic were two therapeutic groups which were treated with the same doses of PPA and clindamycin, respectively, followed by treatment with 0.2 g kg-1 d-1 of probiotic (ProtexinR, Probiotics International Limited) for three weeks. Proapoptotic markers, such as caspases 3 and 7; neuroinflammation markers, such as interleukins 1beta and 8; and heat shock protein 70 were measured in the brain. Significant increase of all measured markers (p< .001) was observed in PPA and clindamycin-treated hamsters compared with controls. Probiotics significantly reduced the damages and ameliorated all the test markers in both therapeutic groups compared with the control. Our results confirmed that probiotics can be utilized as a feasible strategy for managing apoptotic and inflammation-related stresses in brain disorders by retaining the gut function. © 2021 The Authors.

J		Ben Lataief, S.; Mohamed-Nizar Zourgui; Rami Rahmani; Hanen Najjaa; Neji Gharsallah; Lazhar Zourgui							Chemical composition, antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities of bioactive compounds extracted from Opuntia dillenii cladodes.		Journal of Food Measurement and Characterization					Opuntia dillenii has been used in folk medicine as a natural remedy for its diverse biological activities and bioactive compounds. The present study aimed to quantify the bioactive substances of cladode extracts (aqueous and ethanolic) of O. dillenii from Djerba Island, Tunisia and evaluate their antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic potentials. The results showed that O. dillenii cladodes had a high amount of total phenolic content (TPC) and total flavonoid content (TFC). Interestingly, by LC-MS analysis, we found that most of the phenolic and volatile compounds were present in the ethanolic extract. Indeed, quinic acid (58.78 g/g), quercetin (11.5 g/g), rutin (7.02 g/g), luteolin (4.93 g/g), cirsiliol (3.22 g/g) were the major phenolic compounds in O. dillenii ECE. GC-MS analysis of O. dillenii ACE and ECE revealed that n-hexadecanoic acid (13.08%), and stigmastan-3,5-diene (6.97%) were the main volatile compounds detected in ECE. Correlation analysis showed that the TPC and TFC were significantly correlated with the antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities. Staphylococcus aureus, Micrococcus luteus, and Fusarium oxysporumwere found to be the most sensitive strains. Finally, the human colon carcinoma cell line Caco-2 was more sensitive to aqueous and ethanolic extracts with an IC50=50.890.01 g/mL and IC50=400.01 g/mL, respectively than K-562 cell line. ©Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2020.

Food Research International					Tremella fuciformis polysaccharides (TPs) have attracted extensive attention as functional food constituents due to their bioactivity. However, beta-D-glucan obtained from TPs is readily degraded by oxidation and easy to absorb water and agglomerate. The purpose of this study was to reduce moisture adsorption and caking strength through spray drying by using maltodextrin as wall materials and explore the hypoglycemic effect and molecular mechanism of TPs microcapsules. It was observed that dextrose equivalent (DE) value and concentration of maltodextrin (MD) affect the morphology, encapsulation efficiency, loading capacity, water adsorption and caking strength of TPs microcapsules powder. The administration of TPs microcapsules powder prevented body weight and serum insulin loss, and significantly decreased the blood glucose level, serum triglycerides, as well as total cholesterol levels, which seemed to be related to increasing the glycogen synthesis and facilitating the glucose transportation by regulating the PI3K/Akt pathway.

Foods					Flour quality is influenced by the nature of the gluten and its various components. Gluten free flour made of pulses is known to enhance the nutritional quality of wheat flour. However, its addition can compromise the rheological and sensorial attributes of the bread. We used mixture design to optimize nutritional and technological qualities of a wheat-chickpea flour blend by adding milk powder as a natural organoleptic improver. A total of thirteen flour blends were prepared by incorporating 10 to 30% chickpea flour and 10 to 20% milk powder to wheat flour. Our results showed that the optimal flour blend consisted of 60% wheat, 24% chickpea, and 16% milk powder. Farinographic parameters of the optimal dough blend remained on par with those of the control dough (100% wheat flour), thereby preserving its bread-making quality. Sensory analysis of breads made from the optimal flour blend revealed no significant difference (p ≤ 0.05) from wheat flour for crumb and chewiness. Appreciation was brought to the appearance, crust, aroma, and taste in the optimized bread. This study suggests that chickpea flour can be suitably incorporated into bread wheat flour up to a percentage of 24% with 16% milk powder to produce bread with optimal nutritional quality while improving its sensory attributes and consumer acceptability. © 2021 by the authors.

Increasing the content of olive mill wastewater in biogas reactors for a sustainable recovery: methane productivity and life cycle analyses of the process.		Foods					Anaerobic codigestion of olive mill wastewater for renewable energy production constitutes a promising process to overcome management and environmental issues due to their conventional disposal. The present study aims at assessing biogas and biomethane production from olive mill wastewater by performing biochemical methane potential tests. Hence, mixtures containing 0% (blank), 20% and 30% olive mill wastewater, in volume, were experimented on under mesophilic conditions. In addition, life cycle assessment and life cycle costing were performed for sustainability analysis. Particularly, life cycle assessment allowed assessing the potential environmental impact resulting from the tested process, while life cycle costing in conjunction with specific economic indicators allowed performing the economic feasibility analysis. The research highlighted reliable outcomes: higher amounts of biogas (80.2224.49 NL.kgSV-1) and methane (47.6817.55 NL.kgSV-1) were obtained when implementing a higher amount of olive mill wastewater (30%) (v/ v) in the batch reactors. According to life cycle assessment, the biogas ecoprofile was better when using 20% (v/ v) olive mill wastewater. Similarly, the economic results demonstrated the profitability of the process, with better performances when using 20% (v/ v) olive mill wastewater. These findings confirm the advantages from using farm and food industry by-products for the production of renewable energy as well as organic fertilizers, which could be used in situ to enhance farm sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Benavent-Gil, Y.; Rosell, C. M.; Gilbert, E. P.							Understanding CGTase action through the relationship between starch structure and cyclodextrin formation.		Food Hydrocolloids					The action of the enzyme CGTase on corn and potato starch was studied to understand the influence of starch structure and cyclodextrin (CD) production. Native and hydrolysed materials were analysed using multiple characterisation methods enabling coverage over more than six orders of magnitude in length-scale. The production of CD was greater for corn than potato but the relative abundance between different CD molecules was conserved. Structural differences were observed for all length scales investigated as a result of hydrolysis but to different extents between the starches. These observations were explained by differing modes of enzymatic attack between starch varieties. In corn, surface pores facilitated action of CGTase with hydrolysis generating limited changes in crystallinity and surface granule order. Hydrolysis of potato starch resulted in erosion at the granule surface, increase in surface order and overall crystallinity. Hydrolysis had minimal effect on the gelatinisation behaviour of both starches. Changes in the small-angle scattering due to CGTase confirmed the different mode of action of the enzyme between the two starches. Following hydrolysis, these changes in corn were consistent with preferential attack of the amorphous lamellae, while in potato, preferential hydrolysis of amorphous growth rings was indicated. These findings provide new insight into this industrially relevant enzyme and will assist in the optimisation of CGTase-based processing conditions for the development of novel products.

Polyphenolic characterization of merlot, Tannat and Syrah skin extracts at different degrees of maturity and anti-inflammatory potential in RAW 264.7 Cells.		Foods					Background. Both sensory quality and healthy attributes of Vitis vinifera grapes used for winemaking are closely related with the polyphenolic composition of their skins. Methods. In this study, the polyphenolic characterization (flavan-3-ols, procyanidins, flavonols, stilbenes, anthocyanins) was investigated by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (UPLC-QqQ-MS). Skins from Vitis vinifera Merlot, Tannat, and Syrah red grape varieties cultivated in the south of France at different stages of ripening in 2018 were used. The anti-inflammatory and the antioxidant potential of the extracts were evaluated by the measure of nitric oxide (NO) and the intracellular reactive oxygen species production (ROS) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Results. 41 polyphenols were quantified in all samples. Generally, the flavan-3-ol and procyanidin content decreased during ripening whereas the anthocyanins and stilbenes increased. In addition, as a novelty of this work, a wide identification and characterization of monomeric and oligomeric stilbenes was assessed by using authentic standards isolated in our laboratory, some of them (parthenocissin A and miyabenol C) reported for the first time in Merlot, Tannat and Syrah cultivars. The before-veraison skin extracts of all studied varieties, exhibited higher NO and ROS productions inhibition (>50%) proving both antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Bencardino, D.; Amagliani, G.; Brandi, G.							Carriage of Staphylococcus aureus among food handlers: an ongoing challenge in public health.		Food Control					Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal bacterium known to colonize the skin, nares, and gastrointestinal tract of humans. Asymptomatic workers can contaminate food via manual contact or through respiratory secretions thus becoming the source of staphylococcal food poisoning. This gastrointestinal intoxication occurs after the ingestion of food contaminated by enterotoxin-producing Staphylococcus aureus. Although most individuals overcome the infection without medical assistance and make a full recovery, in rare cases the infection can be life-threatening. Hence, Staphylococcus aureus food contamination represents a serious problem for both the food industry and healthcare systems. In the last few decades, many studies have investigated the prevalence of carriers among food handlers. We present an overview of all investigations carried out on nasal carriers working in different food industry settings highlighting the risk associated with cross-contamination.

J		Benchaar, C.							Diet supplementation with thyme oil and its main component thymol failed to favorably alter rumen fermentation, improve nutrient utilization, or enhance milk production in dairy cows.		Journal of Dairy Science					Phenolic compounds and essential oils with high content of phenolic compounds have been reported to exert antimicrobial activities in vitro. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of dairy cow diet supplementation with thyme oil and its main component thymol on intake and total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients, rumen fermentation characteristics, ruminal protozoa, nitrogen excretion, and milk production. For this aim, we used 8 multiparous, ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in a replicated 4*4 Latin square design (28 d periods), balanced for residual effects. Cows were fed 1 of the 4 following experimental treatments: total mixed ration (TMR) with no additive (control); TMR+ monensin [24 mg/kg of dry matter (DM)]; TMR+ thyme oil (50 mg/kg of DM); and TMR+ thymol (50 mg/kg of DM). Compared with the control diet, feeding thyme oil or thymol had no effect on DM intake, nutrient total-tract apparent digestibility, total N excretion, ruminal pH, ammonia concentration, total volatile fatty acid (VFA) concentration, or acetate: propionate ratio. Ruminal protozoa density was not modified by thyme oil, but decreased with thymol supplementation. Supplementation with thyme oil or thymol did not affect milk production, milk composition, or efficiency of milk production. Neither thyme oil nor thymol affected efficiency of dietary N use for milk N secretion (N intake/milk N). Supplementation with monensin tended to decrease DM intake (-1.2 kg/d) and milk fat yield. Total-tract apparent digestibility of nutrients did not differ between cows fed monensin and cows fed the control diet. Total VFA concentration was not changed by monensin supplementation compared with control, but adding monensin shifted the VFA profile toward more propionate and less acetate, resulting in a decrease of acetate: propionate ratio. Protozoa density and ammonia concentration were lower in the ruminal content of cows fed monensin compared with that of cows fed the control diet. Total N excretion was not affected by monensin supplementation. Likewise, efficiency of use of dietary N for milk N secretion was unchanged in cows fed monensin. The results of this study contrasted with the claimed in vitro antimicrobial activity of thyme oil and thymol: we observed no positive effects on rumen metabolism (i.e., N and VFA) or milk performance in dairy cows. Under the conditions of this study, including thyme oil or thymol at 50 mg/kg of DM had no benefits for rumen fermentation, nutrient utilization and milk performance in dairy cows.

J		Benchaar, C.; Hassanat, F.							Method of diet delivery to dairy cows: effects on nutrient digestion, rumen fermentation, methane emissions from enteric fermentation and stored manure, nitrogen excretion, and milk production.		Journal of Dairy Science					This study was conducted to examine the effect of method of diet delivery to dairy cows on enteric CH4 emission, milk production, rumen fermentation, nutrient digestion, N excretion, and manure CH4 production potential. Sixteen lactating cows were used in a crossover design (35-d period) and fed ad libitum twice daily a diet [52:48, forage: concentrate ratio; dry matter (DM) basis] provided as forages and concentrates separately (CF) or as a total mixed ration (TMR). For the CF treatment, concentrates were offered first followed by mixed forages 45 min afterward. Method of diet delivery had no effect on DM intake, but neutral detergent fiber (NDF) intake was greater when the diet was delivered as TMR as compared with CF. Apparent total-tract digestibility of DM, crude protein, and gross energy was slightly (1 percentage unit) lower when the diet was offered as TMR than when offered as CF. In contrast, NDF digestibility was greater when the cows were fed TMR versus CF. Although average daily ruminal pH was not affected by method of diet delivery, daily duration of ruminal pH <5.6 was less when the diet was delivered as TMR as compared with CF (0.9 h/d versus 3.7 h/d). Delivering the diet as TMR increased ruminal total volatile fatty acid and NH3 concentrations, but had no effect on acetate, propionate, or branched-chain volatile fatty acid molar proportions. Yields of milk, milk fat, or milk protein, and milk production efficiency (kg of milk/kg of DM intake or g of N milk/g of N intake) were not affected by the method of diet delivery. Daily production (g/d), yield (% gross energy intake), and emission intensity (g/kg of energy-corrected milk) of enteric CH4 averaged 420 g/d, 4.9%, and 9.6 g/kg and were not affected by diet delivery method. Fecal N output was greater when the diet was delivered as TMR versus CF, whereas urinary N excretion (g/d, % N intake) was not affected. Manure volatile solids excretion and maximal CH4 production potential were not affected by method of diet delivery. Under the conditions of this study, delivering the diet as concentrates and forages separately versus a total mixed ration had no effect on milk production, enteric CH4 energy losses, urinary N, or maximal manure CH4 emission potential. However, feeding the diet as total mixed ration compared with feeding concentrates and forages separately attenuated the extent of postprandial decrease in ruminal pH, which has contributed to improving NDF digestibility.

Sefri variety) extracts rich in punicalagin against the oxidative stress process.		Foods					Natural antioxidants products are widely distributed in food and medicinal plants. These natural antioxidants, especially polyphenols, exhibit a wide range of biological activities including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-atherosclerosis activities. Pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) is a rich source of polyphenolic components. The purpose of this study was to characterize the phenolic composition and flavonoids and anthocyanin content of different parts (peel and aril) of the Sefri variety of pomegranate. Our results showed that Peel extract was richer in these compounds than that of the Arils, especially in Punicalagin (A and B). DPPH free radical scavenging, reducing power (FRAP), beta-carotene bleaching, and hydrogen peroxide scavenging assays revealed a greater dose-dependent activity of pomegranate peel phenolic extract (PPPE) compared to pomegranate aril phenolic extract (PAPE). PPPE was also more potent than PAPE concerning its ability to inhibit conjugated diene formation and to reduce alpha-tocopherol disappearance induced by CuSO4-mediated LDL peroxidation. Interestingly, both extracts (PPPE and PAPE) significantly inhibited lipid peroxidation and the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in stressed J82 human bladder cancer cells. These results reflect the protective effects that this Moroccan variety of pomegranate can provide against the development of metabolic disorder, cancer, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. Given these properties, further studies should be undertaken to investigate possible applications of Sefri pomegranate extracts in the fields of food preservation and health supplements. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Benchikh, Y.; Filali, A.; Rebai, S.							Modeling and optimizing the phycocyanins extraction from Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina) algae and preliminary supplementation assays in soft beverage as natural colorants and antioxidants.		Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					This study aimed optimizing the extraction conditions of phycocyanins from Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina), and their incorporation in soft beverage. The response surface methodology based on Box-Behnken design was used to assess the influence of the three factors being pH (6-10), sample to solvent ratio (1-5 mg/ml), and extraction time (15-85 min) on total phycocyanins content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AA) of Spirulina, and the optimal conditions were, respectively, 7.64 of pH, 3.46 mg/ml, and 44.61 min. The maximum TPC and AA recorded by the two validated models were 37.42 g/100 g DW and 41.15 g AAE/100 g DW, respectively. The enriched natural soft beverage with phycocyanins obtained new product of three formulations (A, B, and C). After sensorial analysis, the training panel prefers the sample A. The phycocyanins beverage developed may be considered as a functional food with an interesting source of natural antioxidant colorants substituting synthetic food additives. Practical applications. This paper focuses on the use of response surface methodology for modeling and optimizing the phycocyanins extraction from Arthrospira platensis (Spirulina), known as Spirulina. The phycocyanins extract (natural colorants and antioxidants) can be used as natural food additives alternative to synthetic ones. In our case, a preliminary supplementation essay was performed, and the phytochemical, antioxidant, and sensorial parameters were assessed. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

J		Bender, R. J.; Brecht, J. K.; Sargent, S. A.							Low storage temperature for tree ripe mangoes under controlled atmospheres with elevated CO2 concentrations.		Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture					Background. Tree-ripe mangoes are of a better quality than the more commonly marketed mature-green fruit. However, the postharvest life of tree-ripe mangoes at the chilling threshold temperature for mature-green fruit of 12 °C is insufficient to allow long distance transport for international marketing. Because the chilling sensitivity often decreases as fruit ripen, lower temperatures (5 and 8 °C) in combination with a controlled atmosphere of 5 kPa O2 plus 10 or 25kPa CO2 were tested to determine whether the quality of tree-ripe mangoes could be maintained longer without chilling injury (CI). Results. Tree-ripe "Tommy Atkins" and "Keitt" mangoes were stored for 14 or 21days, respectively, in air or controlled atmosphere (CA) at 5 or 8 °C. Respiration rates were below 10 mLkg-1 h-1 during CA storage and increased three-fold during a 3-day shelf life period at 20 °C. Ethanol synthesis of fruit stored in 25kPa CO2, but not 10 kPa CO2, increased during storage and remained high during shelf life, indicating physiological stress. Elevated electrolyte leakage and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid concentrations in both cultivars stored in 25kPa CO2 also indicated that mesocarp tissues were injured by the higher CO2 level. No CI symptoms were observed in air or CA at either 5 or 8 °C. Conclusion. Storage of tree-ripe mangoes in 5 kPa O2 plus 10 kPa CO2 at either 5 or 8 °C best maintained the quality of Tommy Atkins and Keitt fruit for 14 or 21days, respectively, without evidence of either atmosphere injury or CI. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry.

Profiling of transcriptional biomarkers in FFPE liver samples: PLS-DA applications for detection of illicit administration of sex steroids and clenbuterol in veal calves.		Food Control					Administering growth promoters to meat-producing animals is strictly regulated within the European Community to preserve consumers' safety. Nevertheless, illicit misuse of steroids and other veterinary drugs to increase animal production has still been found by National Residues Control Plans (NRCPs), mainly based on expensive targeted multi-class/multi-residue analytical methods, used for confirming quantification analysis of these residues in tissues and biological fluids. The setup of complementary novel diagnostic methods, based on indirect biomarkers of exposure to anabolic substances is, therefore, needed to update current tests available in NRCPs at the screening level, where cheaper, sensitive and untargeted methods are required. Biological effects of illicit treatment transcriptomic analysis has reached a good grade of standardization, identified by microarray and RNAseq technologies of large panels of differentially expressed gene targets (DEG) related to abuse of different classes of anabolic molecules (e.g. sex steroids, thyreostats, beta2-agonists, glucocorticoids, etc.). The aim of the work was to identify a minimum set of molecular markers able to detect illicit administration of two of the most recurrent classes of growth promoters (sex steroids and B2-agonists) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, being a potentially straightforward sampling strategy at the slaughterhouse level. A PCR array to allow quantitative profiling of 48 genetic targets was, therefore, developed on FFPE liver samples from veal calves. Conventional univariate and alternative approaches based on multivariate classification methods were considered for gene expression profiling of 92 samples collected from different animal trials, where effects of nandrolone, estradiol, their combination, and clenbuterol were studied. The developed Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models show the successful setup of a novel screening strategy based on multiple transcriptional biomarkers, able to expand tested sample sizes, and consequently strengthen current NRCPs.

Journal of Food Processing and Preservation					Beta (beta)-mannanases, hydrolyzed 1,4-beta-D mannosidic bonds in mannan, galactomannan, glucomannan, and galactoglucomannans, can be used to reduce the viscosity of foods for gum modification. Locust bean gum (LBG) and guar gum (GG) have a wide range of use from food to textile as a thickening agent. In this study, the effect of beta-mannanase on the viscosity of the LBG and GG was investigated. The rheological analysis showed that the flow behavior of LBG and GG changed from pseudoplastic to Newtonian after hydrolysis. The highest viscosities of non-hydrolyzed LBG (%1) and GG (%1) were 1,864.30 and 1,883.80 mPa/s, and the lowest values were 1.60 mPa/s for hydrolyzed LBG (0.5 g/L) and 2.90 mPa/s for GG (0.5 g/L), respectively. A significant decrease in viscosity was observed on the gums with the use of beta-mannanase. Results showed that the beta-mannanase enzyme can be used for gum modification. Practical applications. Beta (beta)-mannanase enzymes could hydrolyze gums, which include mannan units, such as galactomannans and glucomannans. Galactomannans as locust bean gum and guar gum have large scale applications in different food, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical products. They could have been used as a thickener, stabilizer, emulsifier, and gelling agent in emulsion and suspension systems. Additionally, they are also used as food ingredients in bakery goods (icings and cake mixes) and dietary products, coffee whiteners, baby milk formulations, and prebiotic sources. Despite the valuable properties of gums, their solutions have higher viscosity. Consequently, water-soluble application in industry and cleaning of gum processing equipment usually harder. Using beta-mannanase could have overcome the negative effect of viscosity. Moreover, partially hydrolyzed LBG and GG solutions using beta-mannanase could be benefited as a prebiotic source in daily nutrition. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.										2021	45	8			1745-4549				10.1111/jfpp.14820					FSTA:2021-12-Tb4771
J		Bengang Wu; Xiuyu Guo; Yiting Guo; Haile Ma; Cunshan Zhou							Enhancing jackfruit infrared drying by combining ultrasound treatments: effect on drying characteristics, quality properties and microstructure.		Food Chemistry					This study investigates the enhancing effect of power ultrasound (US, 80 W) on the drying characteristics, quality properties and microstructure of jackfruit slices treated with infrared (IR) treatments of 900 W, 1200 W and 1500 W in the meantime. Results showed that when ultrasound was applied, the drying time was reduced by 31%, 35% and 25% compared to pure IR 900 W, 1200 W and 1500 W, respectively. Meanwhile, Deff values of dried samples were improved. The application of ultrasound significantly increased vitamin C retention and total phenolic content at IR 900 W. The micrographs indicate that ultrasound provided a more porous microstructure of dried jackfruit slices thus accelerating the drying process. The color characteristics of IR-US samples showed no significant change compared to IR drying slices. This study shows that infrared assisted with ultrasound can be a potential method for industrial production of dried jackfruit slices.

Nutritional quality of protein concentrates from Moringa oleifera leaves and in vitro digestibility.		Food Chemistry					The nutritional value and digestibility of leaf proteins is still a major issue. Therefore, the goal of this work was to optimize the production of a protein concentrate (PC) from Moringa oleifera defatted leaves (MODL) by enzymatic extraction using Viscozyme L and evaluate its nutritional quality and digestibility. Protein extraction conditions were screened using a factorial design. Enzyme/Substrate ratio and pH had no significant effect, whereas, the significant variables, temperature (°C), enzyme concentration and incubation time (h) were optimized by central composite design (CCD). PC contained 55.7% of proteins with a balanced amino acid profile when compared with MODL and higher content of essential amino acids (EAAs) (488.6-402.9 mg/g of protein respectively). Improvement on protein digestibility was observed for MODL compared to PC (64.75-99.86% respectively) and higher protein digestibility corrected amino acid score (PDCAAS) (62.10-91.41% respectively). PC meets FAO protein quality expectations. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Concentrations, seasonality, and risk assessment of cadmium in scallop, Bractechlamys vexillum (Reeve 1853) in the Visayan Sea, Philippines.		Food Control					Scallop, specifically Bractechlamys vexillum is one of the economically important fishery resources in Central Philippines. However, international trade can be constrained due to high concentrations of cadmium. The present study on the concentrations of contamination, seasonality, and risk assessment of Cd in B. vexillum is necessary to assist competent authorities in strengthening regulatory frameworks that will address food safety issues. Sample collection was conducted in major producing areas in the Visayan Sea. Analytical determination of Cd was carried out using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry for scallop samples and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer-Graphite Furnace Atomizer for both water and sediment samples. Concentrations of Cd in B. vexillum from Visayan Sea mostly exceeded the 1.0 mg/kg maximum allowable limit based on Philippines and EU regulations. Nearly 95% of B. vexillum samples collected from the control area in adjacent Camotes Sea passed the regulatory limit. Higher concentrations of cadmium were recorded in dry season. Preliminary risk assessment obtained in this study showed that the percentage of the population that might contract cancer is 0.01-0.6% for exposed children, 0.08-4% for teens, and 0.2-1% for adults. No significant correlation was obtained between the cadmium content of B. vexillum, water, and sediments. The baseline data generated from this study could be useful for the conduct of further study to evaluate the risk associated with consumption of scallops. Moreover, regular monitoring of cadmium contamination in the Visayan Sea is essential for policy recommendation including risk management and communication. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

Extruded coffee parchment shows enhanced antioxidant, hypoglycaemic, and hypolipidemic properties by releasing phenolic compounds from the fibre matrix.		Food & Function					The dietary fibre and phenolic contents and the functional properties of extruded coffee parchment flour were studied to evaluate its possible use as an ingredient rich in dietary fibre (DF) with potential antioxidant, hypoglycaemic and hypolipidemic properties in extruded products. Coffee parchment flour treated at 160-175 °C and 25% moisture feed showed higher DF (84.3%) and phenolic contents (6.5 mg GAE per g) and antioxidant capacity (32.2 mg TE per g). The extrusion process favoured the release of phenolic compounds from the fibre matrix. Phytochemicals liberated during in vitro simulated digestion exhibited enhanced antioxidant capacity and attenuated reactive oxygen species in intestinal cells (IEC-6). However, the physicochemical and techno-functional properties were just affected by extrusion at high temperature, although extruded coffee parchment flours exhibited lower bulk density and higher swelling capacity than non-extruded ones. Extruded coffee parchment preserved the glucose adsorption capacity and enhanced the alpha-amylase in vitro inhibitory capacity (up to 81%). Moreover, extruded coffee parchment maintained the ability to delay glucose diffusion and exhibited improved capacity to retard starch digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. The extrusion of coffee parchment flours preserved the cholesterol-binding ability and augmented the capacity of this ingredient to bind bile salts, favouring the inhibition of pancreatic lipase by coffee parchment. These discoveries generate knowledge of the valorisation of coffee parchment as a food dietary fibre ingredient with antioxidant, hypoglycaemic, and hypolipidemic properties that are enhanced by the release of phenolic compounds from the fibre matrix through the production of extruded products. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020.

MyNewGut consortium				Sex, food, and the gut microbiota: disparate response to caloric restriction diet with fiber supplementation in women and men.		Molecular Nutrition and Food Research					Scope. Dietary-based strategies are regularly explored in controlled clinical trials to provide cost-effective therapies to tackle obesity and its comorbidities. The article presents a complementary analysis based on a multivariate multi-omics approach of a caloric restriction intervention (CRD) with fiber supplementation to unveil synergic effects on body weight control, lipid metabolism, and gut microbiota. Methods and results. The study explores fecal bile acids (BAs) and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), plasma BAs, and fecal shotgun metagenomics on 80 overweight participants of a 12-week caloric restriction clinical trial (-500 kcal day-1) randomly allocated into fiber (10 g day-1 inulin+ 10 g day-1 resistant maltodextrin) or placebo (maltodextrin) supplementation groups. The multi-omic data integration analysis uncovered the benefits of the fiber supplementation and/or the CRD (e.g., increase of Parabacteroides distasonis and fecal propionate), showing sex-specific effects on either adiposity and fasting insulin; effects thought to be linked to changes of specific gut microbiota species, functional genes, and bacterially produced metabolites like SCFAs and secondary BAs. Conclusions. This study identifies diet-microbe-host interactions helping to design personalised interventions. It also suggests that sex perspective should be considered routinely in future studies on dietary interventions efficacy. All in all, the study uncovers that the dietary intervention is more beneficial for women than men. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

J		Benito-Roman, O.; Blanco, B.; Sanz, M. T.; Beltran, S.							Freeze-dried extract from onion (Allium cepa cv. Horcal) skin wastes: extraction intensification and flavonoids identification.		Food and Bioproducts Processing					In this work, the intensification of the extraction of flavonoids from dry onion skin wastes (DOSW) by Ultrasound Assisted Extraction (UAE) was investigated. Conventional stirred tank extraction was used to find the optimal temperature (37°C) and solvent (ethanol 70%, v/v), providing 20.70.4mg QE/g DOSW after 1h. In the UAE process, the amplitude of oscillation and the solvent-to-solid ratio were key parameters to control the specific energy used. Energies above 10kJ/g OSW did not increase the extraction yield (maximum flavonoids content was 23.90.2mg QE/g DOSW), which could be obtained using amplitudes of 40%, high solvent-to-solid ratios (30mL/g DOSW) and extraction times below 5min. Although both extraction techniques provided similar profiles of phenolic compounds, being quercetin and quercetin-4′-O-glucoside the main flavonoids (7.4mg/g DOSW and 10.4mg/g DOSW, respectively), UAE increased the productivity up to 11.6mg QE/(g DOSW.min), seven times higher than conventional extraction. The extraction kinetics was modeled and studied. The optimum extract was freeze-dried resulting in a solid powder rich in flavonoids (21%) which kept 90% of the antioxidant activity after 180 days of storage at temperatures below 4°C.

Direct detection of Brettanomyces bruxellensis in wine by PCR targeting the vinylphenol reductase gene.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					Brettanomyces bruxellensis is among the main spoilage yeasts in wine usually found in oak barrels. As routine, laboratories at wineries use selective-differential culture media to detect this yeast. Nevertheless, it is widely recognized that other microbial species can grow on these media, getting false positive signals. In this work, we have developed a conventional PCR method based on the vinylphenol reductase gene (VPR1) of B. bruxellensis applied to wines after a polyvinylpyrrolidone-based pre-treatment (7% w/v) and that allowed us to reach a low detection limit, up to 102 UFC/mL of wine. The procedure was conceived without time-consuming DNA extraction steps, simplifying the methodology and making it easy for applying in wineries. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

N. van der							The influence of acute partial sleep deprivation on liking, choosing and consuming high- and low-energy foods.		Food Quality and Preference					A wealth of cross-sectional studies found a link between sleep deprivation and food-related outcomes like energy intake and BMI. Recent experimental studies suggest that this link is causal. However, the mechanisms through which sleep deprivation influences intake remain unclear. Here, we tested two prevailing hypotheses: that sleep deprivation leads to 1) increased food reward sensitivity and 2) decreased food-related self-control. In a within-subject study (n=60 normal-weight females), we compared outcome measures under normal sleep and partial sleep deprivation conditions. Our outcome measures were 1) proxies for food reward sensitivity-liking of high and low energy foods, 2) binary food choices ranging in level of self-control conflict, and 3) intake of high and low energy foods. Eye-movements during food choice were measured with an eye-tracker to gain insights in implicit food choice processes. Food reward sensitivity outcomes showed a lower liking of low energy foods after partial sleep deprivation. More high energy foods were chosen after partial sleep deprivation independent of the level of self-control conflict. Intake of high energy foods was higher in the partial sleep deprivation condition. Lastly, the number of gaze switches between high and low energy foods, an implicit measure of conflict in choice, was lower in the high-conflict trials after sleep deprivation than after a normal night sleep. To conclude, the increased intake of high energy foods after sleep deprivation may be driven by a decreased liking of low energy foods, rather than an increased liking of high energy foods. Further, sleep deprivation may affect self-control conflict detection as indicated by a lower number of gaze switches between food options. All rights reserved, Elsevier.

J		Benkadri, S.; Salvador, A.; Sanz, T.; Zidoune, M. N.							Optimization of xanthan and locust bean gum in a gluten-free infant biscuit based on rice-chickpea flour using response surface methodology.		Foods					Incorporation of xanthan gum and locust bean gum in rice flour supplemented by chickpea flour was used to obtain a good quality of nutritionally enriched biscuit for celiac children. Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the levels of xanthan and locust bean gum added to the composite gluten-free flour. Analysis was based on the rheological (hardness and viscoelastic) characteristics of the dough and specific volume, water activity, and hardness of the biscuit. The results revealed that the regression and variance analysis coefficients related to the rheological and physical properties of dough and biscuit under the influence of independent variables were sufficient for an adequate and well-fitted response surface model. Linear terms of variables significantly affect most of the dough and biscuit parameters, where the xanthan gum effect was found to be more pronounced than locust bean gum. Interaction terms showed a significant positive effect on the specific volume of the biscuits and a negative effect on the water activity. However, the interactive effect of gums did not significantly affect the rheological parameters of the dough. Optimized conditions were developed to maximize the specific volume of biscuit and minimize water activity and biscuit hardness, while keeping hardness and viscoelastic properties of the dough in range. Predicted responses were found satisfactory for both rheological and physical characteristics of dough and biscuit. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

J		Benkeblia, N.							In the landscape of SARS-CoV-2 and fresh fruits and vegetables: the fake and hidden transmission risks.		Journal of Food Safety					From the first notification reporting to the WHO a cluster of coronavirus in Wuhan City (China), over 114 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 have been confirmed, with more than 2,530,000 deaths, and over 400,000 new cases and 10,000 deaths daily. Numerous viruses are susceptible to contaminate crops during growth, harvesting, handling, marketing and minimally processing, and these steps share one common factor which is human. Different studies showed that viruses might persist on different crops for periods of 2 to 14days under different conditions such as refrigeration, household and freezing. Little is known on SARS-CoV-2, but preliminary studies showed that this virus might survive 24hr on cardboard and 72hr on plastic, materials used in fruits and vegetables packaging. Based on preliminary data, there is no evidence of food or food packaging being associated with transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Certainly, to date there is no scientific evidence that SARS-CoV-2 might be transmitted by a contact with, or the ingestion of contaminated fresh or minimally processed fruits and vegetables. However, this risk even though being considered improbable, it cannot be "completely and definitely" discarded or ignored, particularly where the virus is spreading in the word. Some agencies indicated that in case some commodities and handlers are contaminated among the multiple people involved from the farm to the table, a cross-contamination may occur, and the risk of the contamination of food, food contact materials, and packaging from infected but asymptomatic workers should not be discarded even though considered "Very Low=meaning very rare but cannot be excluded." © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Antioxidant, antidiabetic, and antihyperlipidemic activities of wheat flour-based chips incorporated with omega-3-rich fish oil and artichoke powder.		Journal of Food Biochemistry					In the present study, the omega-3-rich oil from fish viscera and gill by-products, and caffeoylquinic-rich powder of artichoke bract by-products were used for the enrichment of wheat flour chips. Incorporation of these ingredients improved the lipid profile by increasing the level of polyunsaturated essential fatty acids mainly linoleic, linolenic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenoic acids enhancing thereby their nutritional quality. In alloxan-induced diabetic mice, the novel products reverts the blood glucose and serum markers including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine to their normal levels. Concomitantly, they prevented lipid peroxidation and activated antioxidant enzymes (catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase). They ameliorate the lipid profile by reducing triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL. Additional efforts aimed at investigating the potential of other raw materials including algal biomass, and shrimps as a sustainable source of valuable ingredients would contribute to the development of new products with improved nutritional and functional attributes. Practical applications. Icorporation of cheap, available, and functional ingredients from fish (omega-3-rich oil) and artichoke bract by-products into wheat flour chips could be successfully adopted for the development of functional foods destined for diabetic patient. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.		hosni, karim/AAE-4584-2022	hosni, karim/0000-0003-0978-8378; Selmi, Slimen/0000-0001-9861-5780; BAATI, TAREK/0000-0002-6603-5615							2021	45	3			1745-4514				10.1111/jfbc.13297					FSTA:2021-07-Ge3935

Analysis of the adsorption and release processes of bioactives from Lamiaceae plant extracts on alginate microbeads.		Food and Bioprocess Technology					Microencapsulation is a frequently used method for protection of functional properties of bioactives. In this study, alginate was used for microencapsulation of the bioactives from five Lamiaceae family plants: lavender, lemon balm, peppermint, sage, and thyme. Analysis of the adsorption and release processes of Lamiaceae bioactives on alginate microbeads was also performed. Based on the analysis of the extract used for the adsorption process, it was concluded that the highest amount of polyphenols (30% of the polyphenols contained in the extract) was transferred to the microbeads from the thyme extract. Also, a period of bead shrinkage during the adsorption process was detected which lasted until 30 min for thyme, 50 min for lavender, lemon balm, and peppermint, while the shrinkage for the sage extract lasted for 60 min. During the release process, a simultaneous rise of conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), polyphenolic (TPC), and antioxidant capacity values in the release media was detected at regular time intervals. The best suited model for the description of the release kinetics was the Korsmeyer-Peppas model, based on which it was concluded that the lemon balm polyphenols entrapped in the alginate matrix were released the fastest (k=0.3260.048 min-1) and that the release was governed by a pseudo-Fickian diffusion mechanism, since the calculated release exponent values (n) were lower than 0.5. ©The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.

J		Benliang Deng; Chunbo Xia; Shan Tian; Haojie Shi							Melatonin reduces pesticide residue, delays senescence, and improves antioxidant nutrient accumulation in postharvest jujube fruit.		Postharvest Biology and Technology					Melatonin reportedly delays postharvest fruit senescence, but information on its in vivo effects on pesticide degradation in postharvest fruit is limited. In this study, we investigated the effect of melatonin on the regulation of pesticide degradation and antioxidant nutrient accumulation in jujube fruit after storage. The results showed that melatonin treatment markedly promoted the degradation of three different types of pesticide (chlorothalonil, malathion, and glyphosate) in postharvest jujube fruit. However, this melatonin-enhanced pesticide degradation was greatly reduced by p-chlorophenylalanine (a specific inhibitor of melatonin synthesis) and L-buthionine-sulfoximine (a specific inhibitor of glutathione). Furthermore, pesticide-induced glutathione and melatonin accumulation, coupled with increased glutathione reductase and glutathione S-transferase activities, was further enhanced by melatonin in jujube fruit after storage. Pesticide-delayed fruit senescence (evaluated by weight loss, decay incidence, and firmness) was also further enhanced by melatonin. Interestingly, pesticide-impaired ascorbic acid contents, total phenolics accumulation, and total antioxidant capacities (as evaluated by Fe3+ reducing power) recovered with melatonin treatment in postharvest jujube fruit. This study provides a new biodegradable method for pesticide removal and improves postharvest fruit quality in agronomic production.

Lentil (Lens culinaris) flour addition to yogurt: impact on physicochemical, microbiological and sensory attributes during refrigeration storage and microstructure changes.		LWT -- Food Science and Technology					This study aims to assess the quality attributes of lentil flour fortified yoghurt during cold storage (6 2 °C) for 21 days. Yogurt formulation was based on the addition of roasted and unroasted lentil flour at rate of 4%. Three formulations (first and the second treatments were prepared with the addition of unroasted and roasted lentil flour (ULF and RLF), respectively and third one plain yogurt) were prepared from partially skimmed cow milk and fermented with specific thermophilic bacteria of yogurt. The physicochemical (pH, titratable acidity and dry extract), microbiological quality and sensory acceptance were evaluated through the entire storage period. Lentil flours structure (roasted and unroasted) has been observed, before and after addition in the yogurt, by scanning electron microscope (SEM). Results showed that addition of lentil flour significantly (p < 0.05) affected the physicochemical and sensorial properties of fortified yogurts. Low syneresis value was observed in yogurt with unroasted and roasted lentil flour, respectively compared with the control. While, the microbiological analysis showed that the yogurts are of satisfactory quality. The most preferred yogurt was the one incorporated with unroasted lentil flour. The SEM observations of lentil flours before and after addition in yogurt found the significant changes in their morphology structure.

J		Bennett, C. T.; Robertson, A.							Depuration kinetics and growth dilution of Caribbean ciguatoxin in the omnivore Lagodon rhomboides: implications for trophic transfer and ciguatera risk.		Toxins					Modeling ciguatoxin (CTX) trophic transfer in marine food webs has significant implications for the management of ciguatera poisoning, a circumtropical disease caused by human consumption of CTX-contaminated seafood. Current models associated with CP risk rely on modeling abundance/presence of CTX-producing epi-benthic dinoflagellates, e.g., Gambierdiscusspp., and are based on studies showing that toxin production is site specific and occurs in pulses driven by environmental factors. However, food web models are not yet developed and require parameterizing the CTX exposure cascade in fish which has been traditionally approached through top-down assessment of CTX loads in wild-caught fish. The primary goal of this study was to provide critical knowledge on the kinetics of C-CTX-1 bioaccumulation and depuration in the marine omnivore Lagodon rhomboides. We performed a two-phase, 17 week CTX feeding trial in L. rhomboides where fish were given either a formulated C-CTX-1 (n = 40) or control feed (n = 37) for 20 days, and then switched to a non-toxic diet for up to 14 weeks. Fish were randomly sampled through time with whole muscle, liver, and other pooled viscera dissected for toxin analysis by a sodium channel-dependent MTT-based mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) assay. The CTX levels measured in all tissues increased with time during the exposure period (days 1 to 20), but a decrease in CTX-specific toxicity with depuration time only occurred in viscera extracts. By the end of the depuration, muscle, liver, and viscera samples had mean toxin concentrations of 189%, 128%, and 42%, respectively, compared to fish sampled at the start of the depuration phase. However, a one-compartment model analysis of combined tissues showed total concentration declined to 56%, resulting in an approximate half-life of 97 d (R2 = 0.43). Further, applying growth dilution correction models to the overall concentration found that growth was a major factor reducing C-CTX concentrations, and that the body burden was largely unchanged, causing pseudo-elimination and a half-life of 143-148 days (R2 = 0.36). These data have important implications for food web CTX models and management of ciguatera poisoning in endemic regions where the frequency of environmental algal toxin pulses may be greater than the growth-corrected half-life of C-CTX in intermediate-trophic-level fish with high site fidelity. © 2021 by the authors.

J		Benninghaus, L.; Walter, T.; Mindt, M.; Risse, J. M.; Wendisch, V. F.							Metabolic engineering of Pseudomonas putida for fermentative production of L-theanine.		Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry					N-alkylated amino acids are intermediates of natural biological pathways and can be found incorporated in peptides or have physiological roles in their free form. The N-ethylated amino acid L-theanine shows taste-enhancing properties and health benefits. It naturally occurs in green tea as major free amino acid. Isolation of L-theanine from Camilla sinensis shows low efficiency, and chemical synthesis results in a racemic mixture. Therefore, biochemical approaches for the production of L-theanine gain increasing interest. Here, we describe metabolic engineering of Pseudomonas putida KT2440 for the fermentative production of L-theanine from monoethylamine and carbon sources glucose, glycerol, or xylose using heterologous enzymes from Methylorubrum extorquens for L-theanine production and heterologous enzymes from Caulobacter crescentus for growth with xylose. L-Theanine (15.4 mM) accumulated in shake flasks with minimal medium containing monoethylamine and glucose, 15.2 mM with glycerol and 7 mM with xylose. Fed-batch bioreactor cultures yielded L-theanine titers of 10 g L-1 with glucose plus xylose, 17.2 g L-1 with glycerol, 4 g L-1 with xylose, and 21 g L-1 with xylose plus glycerol, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first L-theanine process using P. putida and the first compatible with the use of various alternative carbon sources.

J		Bennion, M.; Morrison, L.; Shelley, R.; Graham, C.							Trace elemental fingerprinting of shells and soft tissues can identify the time of blue mussel (Mytilus edulis) harvesting.		Food Control					Reliance on seafood for a source of animal protein is growing globally and this is likely to continue as Earth's population continues to rise. An active shift towards farmed produce over wild caught is occurring, attributed to dwindling wild populations, increased productivity potential and increased food security needs. Although production is rising, producers and regulators are continually challenged as passive filter feeding shellfish such as mussels are impacted by disease outbreaks, toxic algae blooms, pollution and food fraud that pose a risk to the market. This risk can manifest as mortality events and loss of stock, but also via consumer safety and subsequent loss of trust. To combat this threat, accurate and reliable traceability tools are necessary to give regulators power to maintain consumer safety and subsequently, trust. Recent research has demonstrated that trace element fingerprints (TEFs) based on the shell and soft tissues can successfully identify the site of harvest for bivalve shellfish including blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) and king scallops (Pecten maximus) with 100% success.Here, we test the temporal stability of trace element fingerprints (TEFs) of blue mussels within the aquaculture sphere, over five harvesting dates spanning two years. Computational models constructed using the trace element signatures of shells and soft tissues show near absolute temporal differences of TEFs between harvesting dates. However, TEFs based on a combination of both the shell and periostracum of mussels enabled 96% of all individuals to be correctly assigned to their date of harvest indicating that this method can not only identify the location but also the date of harvest of bivalve shellfish. This technique offers a reliable scientific-based traceability tool for regulators to uphold food safety standards and can prove an invaluable asset within the seafood regulatory arsenal.
